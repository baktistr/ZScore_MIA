  "Gerard DuGalle is the commanding admiral of the United Earth Directorate 's expeditionary force to the Koprulu Sector . DuGalle only appears in Brood War and is voiced by Jack Ritschel . Considered the UED 's most capable military leader , DuGalle , a Frenchman , is a staunch believer in the UED 's mission to pacify the sector and carries out his orders with precision . In Brood War , DuGalle leads the UED as it conquers the Terran Dominion ; however , despite his experience , DuGalle believes misinformation planted by former Confederate soldier Samir Duran regarding a psi disruptor , a device that disrupts Zerg communications , on Tarsonis . When DuGalle 's lifelong friend Alexei Stukov abandons the fleet , DuGalle allows Duran to assassinate Stukov as a traitor , only realizing his mistake too late . Nevertheless , DuGalle acts to prevent Duran destroying the psi disruptor and uses it to capture the Zerg Overmind on Char . However , as a result of demoralization , limited manpower and an alliance of enemies led by Kerrigan , the fleet is eventually pushed back and when a final attempt to recapture Char fails , DuGalle orders the retreat . Shortly before the UED fleet is overtaken by Zerg and destroyed , DuGalle composes a letter to his wife in which he admits responsibility for his closest friend 's death and commits suicide by a gunshot to the head .",

  "British intelligence assessed that Tirpitz could be repaired within six months , and the Admiralty ordered further carrier @-@ borne strikes against the battleship . First Sea Lord Andrew Cunningham did not believe that Barracudas could carry weapons capable of sinking Tirpitz , but he hoped that further attacks would increase the period the battleship was out of service and harm her crew 's morale . The commander of the Home Fleet , Vice Admiral Bruce Fraser , initially resisted this order on the grounds that further carrier raids on Kaafjord were unlikely to be successful as Tirpitz 's defences would have been reinforced and weather conditions were likely to be worse than those encountered during Operation Tungsten . Following an argument with Cunningham , Fraser eventually agreed to attack Kaafjord again . Despite the decision to make further attacks on Kaafjord , many of the Home Fleet 's airmen were posted to other units following Operation Tungsten . This hindered subsequent operations against German forces in Norway as the new aircrew were less experienced than the men they replaced .",

  "This scene is remarkable not only for its vividness but as one of the few parts of the Book of the Dead with any explicit moral content . The judgment of the dead and the Negative Confession were a representation of the conventional moral code which governed Egyptian society . For every \" I have not ... \" in the Negative Confession , it is possible to read an unexpressed \" Thou shalt not \" . While the Ten Commandments of Judeo @-@ Christian ethics are rules of conduct laid down by a perceived divine revelation , the Negative Confession is more a divine enforcement of everyday morality . Views differ among Egyptologists about how far the Negative Confession represents a moral absolute , with ethical purity being necessary for progress to the Afterlife .

  "The foundations of the Pax Mongolica lie in the Mongol Empire beginning with Genghis Khan in the early 13th century . In the process of conquering the various tribes in the region , Genghis Khan revolutionized the way Mongolian tribal society was structured .

  "As noted earlier , even among writers who consider consciousness to be a well @-@ defined thing , there is widespread dispute about which animals other than humans can be said to possess it . Edelman has described this distinction as that of humans possessing higher @-@ order consciousness while sharing the trait of primary consciousness with non @-@ human animals ( see previous paragraph ) . Thus , any examination of the evolution of consciousness is faced with great difficulties . Nevertheless , some writers have argued that consciousness can be viewed from the standpoint of evolutionary biology as an adaptation in the sense of a trait that increases fitness . In his article \" Evolution of consciousness \" , John Eccles argued that special anatomical and physical properties of the mammalian cerebral cortex gave rise to consciousness ( \" [ a ] psychon ... linked to [ a ] dendron through quantum physics \" ) . Bernard Baars proposed that once in place , this \" recursive \" circuitry may have provided a basis for the subsequent development of many of the functions that consciousness facilitates in higher organisms . Peter Carruthers has put forth one such potential adaptive advantage gained by conscious creatures by suggesting that consciousness allows an individual to make distinctions between appearance and reality . This ability would enable a creature to recognize the likelihood that their perceptions are deceiving them ( e.g. that water in the distance may be a mirage ) and behave accordingly , and it could also facilitate the manipulation of others by recognizing how things appear to them for both cooperative and devious ends .",

  "In 1932 , the season ended with the Chicago Bears ( 6 @-@ 1 @-@ 6 ) and the Portsmouth Spartans ( 6 @-@ 1 @-@ 4 ) tied for first in the league standings . At the time , teams were ranked on a single table and the team with the highest winning percentage ( not including ties , which were not counted towards the standings ) at the end of the season was declared the champion ; the only tiebreaker was that in the event of a tie , if two teams played twice in a season , the result of the second game determined the title ( the source of the 1921 controversy ) . This method had been used since the league 's creation in 1920 , but no situation had been encountered where two teams were tied for first . The league quickly determined that a playoff game between Chicago and Portsmouth was needed to decide the league 's champion . The teams were originally scheduled to play the playoff game , officially a regular season game that would count towards the regular season standings , at Wrigley Field in Chicago , but a combination of heavy snow and extreme cold forced the game to be moved indoors to Chicago Stadium , which did not have a regulation @-@ size football field . Playing with altered rules to accommodate the smaller playing field , the Bears won the game 9 @-@ 0 and thus won the championship . Fan interest in the de facto championship game led the NFL , beginning in 1933 , to split into two divisions with a championship game to be played between the division champions . The 1934 season also marked the first of 12 seasons in which African Americans were absent from the league . The de facto ban was rescinded in 1946 , following public pressure and coinciding with the removal of a similar ban in Major League Baseball .",

  "After recognizing an antigen , an antigen presenting cell such as the macrophage or B lymphocyte engulfs it completely by a process called phagocytosis . The engulfed particle , along with some material surrounding it , forms the endocytic vesicle ( the phagosome ) , which fuses with lysosomes .

The 2 / 2nd Battalion followed suit , swinging to the right , and the 2 / 3rd then moved straight through the breach . Meanwhile , the 17th Brigade led a diversion to the south . Although the 16th Brigade was able to capture Bardia in the late afternoon of 4 January , resistance continued , and fighting did not cease until the next morning . Over 40 @,@ 000 Italians were captured along with significant amounts of equipment and material – including food and ammunition – which was in short supply . A significant amount of alcohol was also captured by the Australians in Italian dugouts inside the 2 / 3rd 's position around Wadi @-@ el @-@ Ghereida .

  "As a term , neo soul was coined by Kedar Massenburg of Motown Records in the late 1990s as a marketing category following the commercial breakthroughs of artists such as D 'Angelo , Erykah Badu , Lauryn Hill , and Maxwell . The success of D 'Angelo 's 1995 debut album Brown Sugar has been regarded by several writers and music critics as inspiration behind the term 's origin . While some artists have ignored the label , others have received the designation with controversy because it may seem contrived to music audiences and imply that soul music had ended at some point in time . In a 2002 interview for Billboard , Massenburg said that genre classifications are often unpopular because they may be suggestive of a short @-@ lived trend . However , although he said neo soul is still essentially soul music , Massenburg felt there was a need to market artists of the genre for listeners to have an understanding of what they were buying .",

  "At the start of the war , the American government 's refusal to check the Indian seditionist movement was a major concern for the British government . By 1916 , a majority of the resources of the American department of the British Foreign Office were related to the Indian seditionist movement . Before the outbreak of the war , the political commitments of the Wilson Government , ( especially of Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan who had eight years previously had authored \" British Rule in India \" , a highly critical pamphlet , that was classified as seditionist by the Indian and Imperial governments ) , and the political fallouts of the perception of persecution of oppressed people by Britain prevented the then ambassador Cecil Spring Rice from pressing the issue diplomatically . After Robert Lansing replaced Bryan as Secretary of State in 1916 , Secretary of State for India Marquess of Crewe and Foreign Secretary Edward Grey forced Spring Rice to raise the issue and the evidences obtained in Lahore Conspiracy trial were presented to the American government in February . The first investigations were opened in America at this time with the raid of the Wall Street office of Wolf von Igel , resulting in seizures of papers that were later presented as evidence in the Hindu – German Conspiracy Trial . However , a perceptibly slow and reluctant American investigation triggered an intense neutrality dispute through 1916 , aggravated by belligerent preventive measures of the British Far @-@ Eastern fleet on the high seas that threatened the sovereignty of American vessels . German and Turkish passengers were seized from the American vessel China by HMS Laurentic at the mouth of the Yangtze River . Several incidents followed , including the SS Henry S , which were defended by the British government on grounds that the seized ship planned to foment an armed uprising in India . These drew strong responses from the US government , prompting the US Atlantic Fleet to dispatch destroyers to the Pacific to protect the sovereignty of American vessels . Authorities in the Philippines were more cooperative , which assured Britain of knowledge of any plans against Hong Kong . The strained relations were relaxed in May 1916 when the Britain released the China prisoners and relaxed its aggressive policy seeking co @-@ operation with the United States .

  "The Arp2 / 3 complex appears to be important in a variety of specialized cell functions that involve the actin cytoskeleton . The complex is found in cellular regions characterized by dynamic actin filament activity : in macropinocytic cups , in the leading edge of motile cells ( lamellipodia ) , and in motile actin patches in yeast . In mammals and the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum it is required for phagocytosis . The complex has also been shown to be involved in the establishment of cell polarity and the migration of fibroblast monolayers in a wound @-@ healing model . In mammalian oocytes , the Arp2 / 3 complex is involved in oocyte asymmetric division and polar body emission , which result from the failure of spindle migration ( a unique feature of oocyte division ) and cytokinesis . Moreover , enteropathogenic organisms like Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella use the Arp2 / 3 complex for actin @-@ polymerization- dependent rocketing movements .

  "The simplest static black holes have mass but neither electric charge nor angular momentum . These black holes are often referred to as Schwarzschild black holes after Karl Schwarzschild who discovered this solution in 1916 .

This means that there is no observable difference between the gravitational field of such a black hole and that of any other spherical object of the same mass . The popular notion of a black hole \" sucking in everything \" in its surroundings is therefore only correct near a black hole 's horizon ; far away , the external gravitational field is identical to that of any other body of the same mass .",

Kennedy 's staff had researched Bork 's writings and record , and within an hour of the nomination – which was initially expected to succeed – Kennedy went on the Senate floor to announce his opposition :",

  "C. porcellus is not found naturally in the wild ; it is likely descended from some closely related species of cavies , such as C. aperea , C. fulgida , and C. tschudii , which are still commonly found in various regions of South America . Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century , such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae , may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild . Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups which consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature are called pups ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation . They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk , when it is harder for predators to spot them .",

Massive sea battles , like those fought in the Punic Wars , no longer occurred , and the Roman fleets were composed of relatively small vessels , best suited to their new tasks . By the early 4th century , the permanent Roman fleets had dwindled , so that when the fleets of the rival emperors Constantine the Great and Licinius clashed in 324 AD , they were composed to a great extent of newly built or commandeered ships from the port cities of the Eastern Mediterranean .

  "By 08 : 00 , it was clear that despite his vessels speed , Stewart 's plan was going to fail : the captains of Charlton and United Kingdom had not even attempted to join his advance , deliberately checking their advance towards the French , falling far behind Windham . Although Stewart now faced overwhelming odds , he had no option but to continue the attack : his ship was now too close to attempt to flee from the French frigate . Captain Dornal de Guy opened fire at 09 : 30 , his shot repeatedly striking Windham as she approached . Stewart did not return fire , instead waiting until his ship was closer to minimise the inaccuracy of his gunnery . Unable to reach the more nimble French ship directly , Stewart absorbed the French fire until he was as close as he was able before unleashing his guns . The results were disappointing : the entire broadside splashed into the sea far short of the French ship . The more manoeuvrable Manche now approached Windham at close range , and the two ships fired at one another for over an hour , Stewart still unsupported by his companions , who did no more than fire the occasional ineffective shot at extreme range .",

  "In \" Marooned \" , a young mariner ( called \" The Sea Captain \" ) journeys to warn his home town of the coming of the Black Freighter , after he survives the destruction of his own ship . He uses the bodies of his dead shipmates as a makeshift raft . When he finally returns home , believing it to be already under the occupation of the Black Freighter 's crew , he kills an innocent couple and then attacks his own wife in their darkened home , mistaking her for a pirate . After realizing what he has done , he returns to the sea shore , where he finds that the Black Freighter has not come to claim the town ; it has come to claim him . He swims out to sea and climbs aboard the ship . According to Richard Reynold , the mariner is \" forced by the urgency of his mission to shed one inhibition after another . \" Just like Adrian Veidt , he \" hopes to stave off disaster by using the dead bodies of his former comrades as a means of reaching his goal \" .

  "In total , nine battlecruisers survived the Washington Naval Treaty , although HMS Tiger later became a victim of the London Naval Conference of 1930 and was scrapped . Because their high speed made them valuable surface units in spite of their weaknesses , most of these ships were significantly updated before World War II . Renown and Repulse were modernized significantly in the 1920s and 1930s . Between 1934 and 1936 , Repulse was partially modernized and had her bridge modified , an aircraft hangar , catapult and new gunnery equipment added and her anti @-@ aircraft armament increased . Renown underwent a more thorough reconstruction between 1937 and 1939 .

The bridge structure was also removed and a large bridge similar to that used in the King George V @-@ class battleships installed in its place . While conversions of this kind generally added weight to the vessel , Renown 's tonnage actually decreased due to a substantially lighter power plant .

After a rash of killings of lawyers and businessmen in 1974 , the government of Michael Manley attempted to restore order by granting broad new law enforcement powers in the Suppression of Crime Act and the Gun Court Act . The Suppression of Crime Act allowed the police and the military to work together in a novel way to disarm the people : soldiers sealed off entire neighbourhoods , and policemen systematically searched the houses inside for weapons without requiring a warrant . The goal was to expedite and improve enforcement of the 1967 Firearms Act , which imposed licensing requirements on ownership and possession of guns and ammunition , and prohibited automatic weapons entirely . Firearm licences in Jamaica require a background check , inspection and payment of a yearly fee , and can make legal gun ownership difficult for ordinary citizens . The new judicial procedures of the Gun Court Act were designed to ensure that firearms violations would be tried quickly and harshly punished .",

The bluebuck is the first historically recorded large African mammal to become extinct , followed by the quagga ( Equus quagga quagga ) , which died out in 1883 . The bluebuck population had already declined significantly and its range had contracted when Europeans settling in the Cape Colony in the 17th and 18th centuries first came across this antelope . Around the time of its extinction , the bluebuck occurred in what would be known as the Overberg region ( Western Cape ) , probably concentrated in Swellendam .

  "To study tuning systems and other aspects of music theory that require finer distinctions between tones , it is helpful to have a measure of the size of an interval that is finer than an octave and is additive ( as logarithms are ) rather than multiplicative ( as frequency ratios are ) . That is , if tones x , y , and z form a rising sequence of tones , then the measure of the interval from x to y plus the measure of the interval from y to z should equal the measure of the interval from x to z . Such a measure is given by the cent , which divides the octave into 1200 equal intervals ( 12 semitones of 100 cents each ) . Mathematically , given tones with frequencies f1 and f2 , the number of cents in the interval from f1 to f2 is",

  "From the 1970s , Association for the Promotion of Skiing worked with plans to renovate the hill , especially to fill in the lower section close to Lillevann . The proposal met little support from the municipality , who wanted to prioritize Wyllerløypa , which was much cheaper to upgrade . Thus Rødkleiva was degraded to a training course . On 2 October 1986 the city council changed their opinion and granted funds for upgrading the hill . The upgrade would have given sufficient standard to allow FIS Alpine Ski World Cup events in slalom to be held and was part of a municipal strategy to market Oslo as a winter sports destination . In 1987 , a proposal was made for the Holmenkollen area to become a national arena for freestyle skiing , with Rødkleiva to be made into a permanent mogul course . The hill was taken over by Tryvann Ski Resort in 1988 . Plans to build a new ski lift which would connect with the other slopes were launched in November of that year . Rødkleiva was planned as the main competition hill for slalom and would regain its Olympics size .

  "In oxidative phosphorylation , the passage of electrons from NADH and FADH2 through the electron transport chain powers the pumping of protons out of the mitochondrial matrix and into the intermembrane space . This creates a proton motive force that is the net effect of a pH gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane . Flow of protons down this potential gradient – that is , from the intermembrane space to the matrix – provides the driving force for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase . This enzyme contains a rotor subunit that physically rotates relative to the static portions of the protein during ATP synthesis .",
  "The Atlantic Heat Piracy model suggests that changes in oceanic circulation cause one hemisphere 's oceans to become warmer at the other 's expense ( Seidov and Maslin 2001 ) . Currently , the Gulf stream redirects warm , equatorial waters towards the northern Nordic Seas . The addition of fresh water to northern oceans may reduce the strength of the Gulf stream , and allow a southwards current to develop instead . This would cause the cooling of the northern hemisphere , and the warming of the southern , causing changes in ice accumulation and melting rates and possibly triggering shelf destruction and Heinrich events ( Stocker 1998 ) .",

According to Rare member Brendan Gunn , Betteridge found out how to develop cheap backgrounds that took up little space . After thinking about what and how to move objects on such backgrounds , he came up with the idea for a snake .

Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical time due to human activities . Specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to DNA analysis .

  "The perceived threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military . By mid @-@ 1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions , three armoured divisions and hundreds of other units . The RAAF and RAN were also greatly expanded , though it took years for these services to build up to their peak strengths . Due to the increased need for manpower , the restrictions which prohibited non @-@ Europeans from joining the military ceased to be enforced from late 1941 , and about 3000 Indigenous Australians eventually enlisted . Most of these personnel were integrated into existing formations , but a small number of racially segregated units such as the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion were formed . A number of small units made up of Indigenous Australians were also established to patrol northern Australia and harass any Japanese forces which landed there ; the members of these units did not receive pay or awards for their service until 1992 . Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps , which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively . Australia 's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain the expanded military after the threat of invasion had passed , and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943 while only 53 of the 73 RAAF squadrons approved by the government were ever raised .",

  "An aspect of gameplay in Murder on the Orient Express which received largely negative reactions was the repetitive nature of many tasks the player must complete . 2404 accused the game of reducing Christie 's novel , and the game , into a series of repetitive and secretarial tasks , such as collecting fingerprints , passports , and other random items . The site further went on to say that the player is made to feel \" like a secretary for Poirot . \" Game Over Online agreed with this view , saying that much of the game consisted of \" goofy little errands \" such as completing tasks for characters and mindlessly searching for objects . Eurogamer provides an example of this , by saying that at one point in the game the player is required to go through each cabin checking the shoe sizes of the various passengers ' shoes to check if one matches shoe prints outside the train . The inventory system featured in Murder on the Orient Express has also received significant criticism . IGN complained that instead of being able to find item combinations through trial and error in the main screen , the player is forced to drag items to a separate screen , leading to tedious gameplay . Some reviewers , in contrast , praised the inventory system , with Quandary calling it intuitive , and easy for players to organize . The puzzles in Murder on the Orient Express received positive responses from some reviewers . GameSpot commented favourably on the relatively small number of puzzles in the game , saying that they are integrated fairly well within the plot , and are not excessively difficult . The review went on to say that later puzzles in the game often rely more heavily on inventory combinations , but are still reasonably satisfying to solve . Game Over Online , in comparison , accused the game of giving the player too little information to solve puzzles , and also called the puzzles convoluted . The choice of the developers of Murder on the Orient Express to use Antoinette Marceau , rather than Poirot , as the protagonist and player character was criticized by some . 2404 disapproved of the choice , accusing the developers of not fully utilizing the talent of David Suchet , arguably the most famous and successful portrayer of Poirot . The reviewer even went so far as to tell AWE Productions to \" make use of talent like David Suchet when you 've got it . \" Like its predecessor , Murder on the Orient Express was criticized for diverging from Christie 's original ending . Adventure Gamers called the new ending \" a little too contrived for the game 's good . \" 2404 also disapproved of the ending , commenting that it goes off in too much of a Hollywood direction , and that the original ending is much better and a far more satisfying conclusion .",

The majority of this spread took place several years after the initial development of the game ; while there are early anecdotes of players and game variants at a handful of locations , primarily near MIT and Stanford , it was only after 1967 that computers hooked up to monitors or terminals capable of playing Spacewar began to proliferate , allowing the game began to reach a wider audience and influence later video game designers — by 1971 , it is estimated that there were over 1000 computers with monitors , rather than a few dozen .

A joint committee of the Imperial War Museum , the National Maritime Museum and the Ministry of Defence was established , and reported in June 1968 that preservation was practical . In 1971 the government decided against preservation , prompting the formation of the private HMS Belfast Trust to campaign for her to be saved for the nation . The Trust was successful in its efforts , and the government transferred the ship to the Trust in July 1971 . Brought to London , she was moored on the River Thames near Tower Bridge in the Pool of London . Opened to the public in October 1971 Belfast became a branch of the Imperial War Museum on 1 March 1978 , being acknowledged by the then Secretary of State for Education and Science , Shirley Williams , as ' a unique demonstration of an important phase of our history and technology ' . In service for 24 years HMS Belfast was in Frankland 's opinion , capable of representing ' a whole generation of [ historical evidence ] ' .",
  "The contract for construction of Ajax was signed by Snowden & Mason on 15 September 1862 , and the keel of the ship was laid down later in the year in their new shipyard at Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The ship 's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors . This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from 8 inches ( 203 mm ) to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret . Other changes included deepening the hull by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) to increase the ship 's buoyancy , moving the position of the turret to balance the ship 's trim and replacing all of the ship 's deck armor . She was ready to be launched in April 1864 , but the very low level of the Ohio River rendered that impossible . She was finally launched on 18 December . While fitting out , Ajax was ripped loose from her moorings on 5 March 1865 and she had to be towed back to her berth . The following day she was towed to Mound City , Illinois where she arrived on 11 March . Snowden & Mason had to pay $ 7 @,@ 000 for the tow as well as ship 400 long tons ( 410 t ) of material needed to finish the ship .",

  "Bede puts a clear emphasis on Oswald being saintly as a king ; although he could be interpreted as a martyr for his subsequent death in battle , Bede portrays Oswald as being saintly for his deeds in life and does not focus on his martyrdom as being primary to his sainthood — indeed , it has been noted that Bede never uses the word \" martyr \" in reference to Oswald . In this respect , as a king regarded as saintly for his life while ruling — in contrast to a king who gives up the kingship in favour of religious life , or who is venerated because of the manner of his death — Bede 's portrayal of Oswald stands out as unusual . Bede recounts Oswald 's generosity to the poor and to strangers , and tells a story highlighting this characteristic : on one occasion , at Easter , Oswald was sitting at dinner with Aidan , and had \" a silver dish full of dainties before him \" , when a servant , whom Oswald \" had appointed to relieve the poor \" , came in and told Oswald that a crowd of the poor were in the streets begging alms from the king . Oswald , according to Bede , then immediately had his food given to the poor and even had the dish broken up and distributed . Aidan was greatly impressed and seized Oswald 's right hand , stating : \" May this hand never perish . \" Accordingly , Bede reports that the hand and arm remained uncorrupted after Oswald 's death .",

During a conflict , Britain would be able to provide them with weapons and other goods not produced locally . Critics of Moreno consider him an Anglophile because of this proposal , but the same document also warns against the risk of allowing Britain too much influence in national economy .

  "It has also been argued that although where possible local statutes should be interpreted in light of international treaties , it is not the role of the judiciary to import international law standards into the Constitution that are inconsistent with legislation instead of deferring to the views of the executive . According to this view , which hinges on a strict adherence to the separation of powers doctrine , the judiciary should guard against unwarranted incursions into the executive sphere , as it is for the executive to determine Singapore 's attitude and position in relation to foreign affairs . The judiciary must not undertake its task of interpreting the Constitution arbitrarily , but should accord with legal reasoning and sound principles . This necessarily raises the question of what the applicable legal principle during the interpretation process should be . It has been suggested that the executive and the judiciary should show solidarity by speaking with \" one voice \" , and that the courts should exercise deference in favour of what the executive deems to be the nation 's attitude towards the particular international law norm that is sought to be applied .",

However , subsequent detailed studies of the battlefield showed that most of the destroyed German armor were knocked out by gunfire from ground forces and that the main effect of the Allied air attacks had been to destroy the unarmored vehicles and troops in the German offensive , as well as forcing the German armor to disperse to cover . The accuracy of the rockets and bombs of the Allied fighter @-@ bombers was simply too poor to destroy more than a few of the German tanks , although fear of being incinerated inside a tank should a rocket or bomb actually strike a tank did cause some of the inexperienced German tank crews to abandon their tanks intact while under air attack .

  "Other remains of similar animals were found throughout the late 19th century and 20th century . Another well @-@ preserved skeleton from the slightly older Horseshoe Canyon Formation , in Alberta , Canada , was named T. warreni by William Parks in 1926 . This skeleton had notable differences from T. neglectus , and so Charles M. Sternberg placed it in a new genus , Parksosaurus , in 1937 . Sternberg also named an additional species , T. edmontonensis , based on another articulated skeleton , this time including a partial skull ( NMC 8537 ) , and drew attention to the genus ' heavy build and thick bones . Due to these differences from the regular light hypsilophodont build , he suggested that the genus warranted its own subfamily , Thescelosaurinae . T. edmontonensis has , since Peter Galton 's 1974 review , generally been considered a more robust individual ( possibly the opposite sex of the type individual ) of T. neglectus . However , Boyd and colleagues found that they could not assign it to either of their valid species of Thescelosaurus and regarded the specimen as of uncertain placement within the genus . The other point of contention regarding T. edmontonensis is its ankle , which Galton claimed was damaged and misinterpreted , but which was regarded by William J.

  "The vegetative stage encompasses those phases of the life cycle involved with the germination , spread , and survival of the mycelium . Spores germinate under suitable conditions of moisture and temperature , and grow into branching filaments called hyphae , pushing out like roots into the rotting wood . These hyphae are homokaryotic , containing a single nucleus in each compartment ; they increase in length by adding cell @-@ wall material to a growing tip . As these tips expand and spread to produce new growing points , a network called the mycelium develops . Mycelial growth occurs by mitosis and the synthesis of hyphal biomass . When two homokaryotic hyphae of different mating compatibility groups fuse with one another , they form a dikaryotic mycelia in a process called plasmogamy . Prerequisites for mycelial survival and colonization a substrate ( like rotting wood ) include suitable humidity and nutrient availability . The majority of Cyathus species are saprobic , so mycelial growth in rotting wood is made possible by the secretion of enzymes that break down complex polysaccharides ( such as cellulose and lignin ) into simple sugars that can be used as nutrients .",

  "The mass , radius and luminosity of a star are closely interlinked , and their respective values can be approximated by three relations . First is the Stefan – Boltzmann law , which relates the luminosity L , the radius R and the surface temperature Teff . Second is the mass – luminosity relation , which relates the luminosity L and the mass M. Finally , the relationship between M and R is close to linear . The ratio of M to R increases by a factor of only three over 2 @.@ 5 orders of magnitude of M. This relation is roughly proportional to the star 's inner temperature TI , and its extremely slow increase reflects the fact that the rate of energy generation in the core strongly depends on this temperature , whereas it has to fit the mass – luminosity relation . Thus , a too high or too low temperature will result in stellar instability .",

  "Chalcogens also form compounds with halogens known as chalcohalides . Such compounds are known as chalcogen halides . The majority of simple chalcogen halides are well @-@ known and widely used as chemical reagents . However , more complicated chalcogen halides , such as sulfenyl , sulfonyl , and sulfuryl halides , are less well @-@ known to science . Out of the compounds consisting purely of chalcogens and halogens , there are a total of 13 chalcogen fluorides , nine chalcogen chlorides , eight chalcogen bromides , and six chalcogen iodides that are known . The heavier chalcogen halides often have significant molecular interactions . Sulfur fluorides with low valences are fairly unstable and little is known about their properties . However , sulfur fluorides with high valences , such as sulfur hexafluoride , are stable and well @-@ known . Sulfur tetrafluoride is also a well @-@ known sulfur fluoride . Certain selenium fluorides , such as selenium difluoride , have been produced in small amounts . The crystal structures of both selenium tetrafluoride and tellurium tetrafluoride are known .

Dichalcogen dihalides , such as Se2Cl2 also are known to exist . There are also mixed chalcogen @-@ halogen compounds . These include SeSX , with X being chlorine or bromine . Such compounds can form in mixtures of sulfur dichloride and selenium halides . These compounds have been fairly recently structurally characterized , as of 2008 . In general , diselenium and disulfur chlorides and bromides are useful chemical reagents . Chalcogen halides with attached metal atoms are soluble in organic solutions . One example of such a compound is MoS2Cl3 . Unlike selenium chlorides and bromides , selenium iodides have not been isolated , as of 2008 , although it is likely that they occur in solution . Diselenium diiodide , however , does occur in equilibrium with selenium atoms and iodine molecules . Some tellurium halides with low valences , such as Te2Cl2 and Te2Br2 , form polymers when in the solid state . These tellurium halides can be synthesized by the reduction of pure tellurium with superhydride and reacting the resulting product with tellurium tetrahalides . Ditellurium dihalides tend to get less stable as the halides become lower in atomic number and atomic mass . Tellurium also forms iodides with even fewer iodine atoms than diiodies . These include TeI and Te2I . These compounds have extended structures in the solid state . Halogens and chalcogens can also form halochalcogenate anions .",

This appears to suggest that Shepseskare ruled after — rather than before — Neferefre . Verner 's second argument concerns the alignment of pyramids of Sahure , Neferirkare Kakai and Neferefre : they form a line pointing to Heliopolis , just as the three pyramids of Giza do . In contrast , Shepseskare 's unfinished pyramid does not fall on the line to Heliopolis , which strongly suggests that Neferefre 's pyramid had already been in place when Shepseskare started his . Finally , Verner observes that Neferefre is known to have been Neferirkare 's eldest son and around 20 years old when his father died so that he was in optimal position to inherit the throne . Shespeskare thus most likely took the throne after Neferefre . As Verner notes , while Shepseskare is noted as the immediate predecessor of Neferefre in the Saqqara tablet , \" this slight discrepancy can ... be attributed to the [ political ] disorders of the time and its dynastic disputes . \"",

  "The show features classic Western motifs such as train robberies and gunfighter showdowns , in combination with atypical elements . Much of the series is devoted to the science fiction plot surrounding the Orb , and it is this mix of the Western genre with fantasy that has helped Brisco maintain its cult status . In almost every episode , the characters discover or are confronted by fantastic technology . In the pilot episode , Brisco and Professor Wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks . In the episode \" Brisco For the Defense \" , Brisco uses a slide projector to show a trial jury fingerprint evidence . Professor Wickwire returns many times in the series to assist with technology , including tinkering with motorcycles and rescuing the heroes with a helium @-@ filled zeppelin .

Although Miceli had just announced that test results at Dahlgren showed that an electronic timer had not caused the explosion , Trost endorsed the report on 31 August , stating that Hartwig was \" the individual who had motive , knowledge , and physical position within the turret gun room to place a device in the powder train \" . Trost 's endorsement cited Smith 's statement to the NIS as further evidence that Hartwig was the culprit .

  "Puritans believed that God is sovereign over all of history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated . There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God 's decree of predestination , or choice to save some people , to the redemption purchased by Christ 's death . Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were eternally chosen to be saved , a doctrine called particular redemption . A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical universalism . Edmund Calamy held such a view , and he argued that Christ 's death , as well as saving those who had been chosen , offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe . The Assembly 's Confession did not teach such a view , and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation , but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession 's language allows an hypothetical universalist interpretation .",

One popular explanation is that given the quantities of weapons and money being stored at the property by this time , the gatehouse was designed to improve the internal security of the castle ; the presence of the additional portcullises would also support this explanation .

From the 1550s , until the Matrimonial Causes Act became law in 1857 , divorce in England was only possible , if at all , by the complex and costly procedure of a private Act of Parliament .

An alternative was to obtain a \" private separation \" , an agreement negotiated between both spouses , embodied in a deed of separation drawn up by a conveyancer . Desertion or elopement was also possible , whereby the wife was forced out of the family home , or the husband simply set up a new home with his mistress . Finally , the less popular notion of wife selling was an alternative but illegitimate method of ending a marriage .

Bottomley 's position worsened when he fell out with Bigland , after refusing to finance his former associate 's scheme for turning water into petrol . The two had quarrelled during the war , when Bigland had attacked Bottomley in print . They had later reconciled , but after their second dispute Bigland turned vengeful . In September 1921 he published a leaflet describing the War Bond Club as Bottomley 's \" latest and greatest swindle \" . Against the advice of his lawyers , Bottomley sued for criminal libel , and brought other charges against Bigland of blackmail and extortion . The preliminary hearing , at Bow Street Magistrates ' Court in October 1921 , at which Bottomley 's methods were revealed , proved disastrous to his credibility . Nevertheless , Bigland was committed for trial at the Old Bailey on the libel charge , and to Shropshire Assizes on charges of attempted extortion . The libel trial began on 23 January 1922 ; to prevent further damaging disclosures in court , Bottomley 's lawyers offered no evidence , and Bigland was discharged . The extortion case went ahead in Shrewsbury on 18 February 1922 , at the end of which it took the jury only three minutes to find Bigland not guilty . Bottomley , himself now under police investigation , was ordered to pay the costs of the trial . A few days afterwards , he was summoned to appear at Bow Street , on charges of fraudulent conversion of Victory Bond Club funds .

  "Around this time a change had come in the governance of the Mughal Province of Sira to the north and northeast of Mysore .

That same year , the military governor of the old province , Sadat @-@ ulla Khan , was made the new Nawab of Arcot , and another official , Amin Khan , was appointed Nawab of Sira ; Since Mysore remained a formal tributary state of Sira , this division , and the resulting loss of revenue from the rich Maidān plain of Mysore , provoked Sadat @-@ ulla Khan 's displeasure . In collusion with the rulers of Kadapa , Kurnool , and Savanur and the Maratha Raja of Gutti , he decided to march against Dodda Krishnaraja I. The Nawab of Sira , anxious to preempt the coalition 's action , hit upon a similar plan for reaching the Mysore capital , Seringapatam . In the end , both Nawabs — of Arcot and Sira — settled upon a joint invasion led by the former . Dodda Krishnaraja , for his part , was able to \" buy off this formidable confederacy \" by offering a tribute of Rs . 10 million ( 10 million ) . Although avoiding bloodshed , the outcome made Mysore vulnerable to similar future claims , which were made successfully two years later by Maratha raiders who appeared in the Mysore capital . The resulting depletion of the Mysore treasury led Mysore to attack and absorb the poligar chiefdom of Magadi to its north . ( See Map 11 . )",

  "The first railway station to be built in Trondheim was located at Kalvskinnet , to serve the narrow gauge Trondhjem – Støren Line railway that was completed in 1864 . The station was designed by Georg Andreas Bull , and still exists as a synagogue . In 1877 the state and city made an agreement to build a new station at Brattøra to serve the new Meråker Line that was being built to Sweden . Brattøra was chosen because it was located directly beside the port , and would allow direct transshipment from ships to the railway of both goods and passengers . The station would become the main station for both railways ; this caused a major protest among the local population , who felt it was necessary to have two terminal stations , one for each line , and the city brought the matter before the courts — the case was settled in 1895 in favor of one station . The lack of planning and coordination between the two lines made the new station a large budget cost for the Meråker Line ; and described as one of few exceptions to the small @-@ and @-@ cheap policy dominating the state railways i Norway at the time .",

  "In the human body , lead inhibits porphobilinogen synthase and ferrochelatase , preventing both porphobilinogen formation and the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX , the final step in heme synthesis . This causes ineffective heme synthesis and subsequent microcytic anemia . At lower levels , it acts as a calcium analog , interfering with ion channels during nerve conduction . This is one of the mechanisms by which it interferes with cognition . Acute lead poisoning is treated using disodium calcium edetate : the calcium chelate of the disodium salt of ethylene @-@ diamine @-@ tetracetic acid ( EDTA ) . This chelating agent has a greater affinity for lead than for calcium and so the lead chelate is formed by exchange . This is then excreted in the urine leaving behind harmless calcium . According to the Agency for Toxic Substance and Disease Registry , a small amount of ingested lead ( 1 % ) will store itself in bones , and the rest will be excreted by an adult through urine and feces within a few weeks of exposure . However , only about 32 % of lead will be excreted by a child .",

The group 's style evolved from a mix of jazz , country music , blues and rock , which was the result of each individual member turning the others onto their particular interests . Trucks introduced Johnson to the Grateful Dead and the Rolling Stones ; Johnson likewise introduced the group to jazz musicians such as Miles Davis and John Coltrane , and Betts did the same with country music and Chuck Berry .

  "Treatment of TB uses antibiotics to kill the bacteria . Effective TB treatment is difficult , due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall , which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective . The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin , and treatments can be prolonged , taking several months . Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic , while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics to reduce the risk of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance . People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life . Directly observed therapy , i.e. , having a health care provider watch the person take their medications , is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics . The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is poor . Methods to remind people of the importance of treatment do , however , appear effective .",

  "A major development of this period that would have a profound impact on Kannada literature even into the modern age was the birth of the Haridasa ( \" servants of Hari or Vishnu \" ) movement . This devotional movement , although reminiscent in some ways of the Veerashaiva movement of the 12th century ( which produced Vachana poetry and taught devotion to the god Shiva ) , was in contrast intimately devoted to the Hindu god Vishnu as the supreme God .

  "A hypothesis of Albertosaurus life history postulates that hatchlings died in large numbers , but have not been preserved in the fossil record due to their small size and fragile construction . After just two years , juveniles were larger than any other predator in the region aside from adult Albertosaurus , and more fleet of foot than most of their prey animals . This resulted in a dramatic decrease in their mortality rate and a corresponding rarity of fossil remains . Mortality rates doubled at age twelve , perhaps the result of the physiological demands of the rapid growth phase , and then doubled again with the onset of sexual maturity between the ages of fourteen and sixteen . This elevated mortality rate continued throughout adulthood , perhaps due to the high physiological demands of procreation , including stress and injuries received during intraspecific competition for mates and resources , and eventually , the ever @-@ increasing effects of senescence . The higher mortality rate in adults may explain their more common preservation . Very large animals were rare because few individuals survived long enough to attain such sizes . High infant mortality rates , followed by reduced mortality among juveniles and a sudden increase in mortality after sexual maturity , with very few animals reaching maximum size , is a pattern observed in many modern large mammals , including elephants , African buffalo , and rhinoceros . The same pattern is also seen in other tyrannosaurids . The comparison with modern animals and other tyrannosaurids lends support to this life history hypothesis , but bias in the fossil record may still play a large role , especially since more than two @-@ thirds of all Albertosaurus specimens are known from one locality .",

  "The six decades from around 1870 to 1930 saw a redoubling of Austen 's international renown , with translations of her works into other languages ( including French , German , Danish and Swedish ) and three biographical studies and analyses of her literary themes . In 1869 the first significant Austen biography ( A Memoir of Jane Austen by her nephew , James Edward Austen @-@ Leigh ) was published , and her popularity and critical standing increased dramatically . Readers of the Memoir were presented with the myth of an amateur novelist who wrote masterpieces ; it fixed in the public mind a sentimental image of Austen as a quiet , middle @-@ aged maiden aunt whose work was appropriate for a respectable Victorian family . Austen @-@ Leigh commissioned a portrait of Austen , based on an earlier watercolour , which softened her image for the Victorian public . Richard Bentley 's engraving , the Memoir 's frontispiece , is based on this idealised image . The Memoir sparked a revival of Austen 's novels . The first popular editions ( an economical , sixpenny series published by Routledge ) were published in 1883 . This was followed by elaborate illustrated editions , collectors ' sets and scholarly editions . Contemporary critics continued to assert that Austen 's works were sophisticated , capable of enjoyment only by those who could plumb their depths . However , more criticism of Austen 's novels was published in the two years following the Memoir than had appeared in the previous fifty . Austen descendants William Austen @-@ Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen @-@ Leigh published the definitive family biography , Jane Austen : Her Life and Letters — A Family Record , in 1913 . Based primarily on family papers and letters , it was described by Austen biographer Park Honan as \" accurate , staid , reliable , and at times vivid and suggestive \" . The authors distanced themselves from the Memoir 's sentimental tone , making little effort to go beyond immediately available family records and traditions , and their book offers facts with little interpretation .",

  "The act of premastication is commonly found in all human societies and populations , although it is less prevalent in some than others . The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro @-@ nutrients . Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre @-@ chewed foods , the benefits conferred outweighed any risks of the practice during the evolution of human behaviour . Furthermore , discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s . In the end , the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child . The true scope of the benefits of premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research , though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice .",

Hawes delivered a lengthy inaugural address in which he declared , \" It is now a truth and a fact that the late Union cannot be restored . \" He promised to call a convention to provide for a permanent government as soon as such a convention was feasible , and denounced the Union 's goal of freeing the slaves . In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony , however , the Confederate forces let their guard down , and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Union general Don Carlos Buell . Hawes later denied ever taking the oath of office , and became a vocal critic of Bragg .",
  "The electrons in the 4f @-@ subshell , which is progressively filled from cerium ( element 58 ) to ytterbium ( element 70 ) , are not particularly effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub @-@ shells further out . The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them . Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius ( and chemistry ) as zirconium , and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium , and so forth . This is known as the lanthanide contraction . The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum ( element 78 ) , after which it is masked by a relativistic effect known as the inert pair effect . The d @-@ block contraction , which is a similar effect between the d @-@ block and p @-@ block , is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause .",

While this supported winds of only tropical storm force ( 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) ) , the storm had a small radius of outermost closed isobar embedded in a ridge of high pressure , so winds in Florida were deemed to be 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) , affirming earlier reports that listed the storm as a hurricane at landfall .

  "The academic debate about Anne 's birth date focuses on two key dates : 1501 and 1507 . Eric Ives , a British historian and legal expert , advocates the 1501 date , while Retha Warnicke , an American scholar who has also written a biography of Anne , prefers 1507 . The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514 . She wrote it in French to her father , who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen , in the Burgundian Netherlands , now Belgium . Ives argues that the style of the letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about thirteen at the time of its composition , while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child . In Ives 's view , this would also be around the minimum age that a girl could be a maid of honour , as Anne was to the regent , Margaret of Austria . This is supported by claims by a chronicler from the late 16th century , who wrote that Anne was twenty when she returned from France . These findings are contested by Warnicke in several books and articles , and the evidence does not conclusively support either date .",

  "His first year of Q @-@ ship service was frustrating for Stuart and the crew . Although , prior to his attachment to the ship , Farnborough had succeeded in sinking an enemy submarine ( the U @-@ 68 in March 1916 ) , there had been no successes since . In February 1917 , Campbell decided that in order to properly invite an attack , the Farnborough would have to actually be torpedoed before combat and then engage the submarine as she closed to finish the job with shellfire . On 17 February this theory was proven correct off Southern Ireland when the lone Farnborough was struck by a torpedo fired at extreme range . Campbell intentionally failed to evade the missile and the ship took the blow in the hold , causing some minor injuries to the crew but serious damage to the ship . The crew were well rehearsed and the \" panic party \" took to their boats with a great show of alarm and disorder while the gun crews manned positions on their hidden weapons . When four lifeboats had been released and the ship had settled in the water and was clearly sinking , the submarine U @-@ 83 pulled up just ten yards ( 9m ) from the wreck . A hail of shot was then unleashed by the Farnborough 's remaining crew from their six @-@ pounder gun and several machine guns into the stationary submarine . The very first shot decapitated the German captain Bruno Hoppe and the U @-@ boat was rapidly reduced to a battered wreck . Eight German sailors escaped the submarine before it sank but only two could be pulled from the water , one of whom subsequently died from his wounds .",

  "Given that Moreno González 's body was never recovered from the December 2010 shootout where officials said he was killed , there were rumors that he was alive and secretly leading the Knights Templar Cartel , the split @-@ off group of La Familia Michoacana . On June 2011 , members of La Familia Michoacana set up several public banners throughout the state of Guerrero with written messages directed to the former President Calderón and his security spokesman Alejandro Poiré . The banners proclaimed that Moreno González was in fact alive and leading the Knights Templar Cartel , and that the government was allegedly covering him up . The rumors were immediately denied by the Mexican government , which stood firm that the drug lord was killed by federal forces on December 9 , 2010 . Rumors sparked again in October 2011 following the arrest of Mario Buenrostro Quiroz , a drug trafficker who headed a Mexico City @-@ based gang known as Los Aboytes .

On 27 October 2012 , the Mexican Army raided a safe house in Apatzingán where they believed the drug lord Enrique Plancarte Solís was hiding . Though the raid was ultimately unsuccessful because Plancarte Solís managed to avoid capture by sending several gunmen from his inner circle to battle off the soldiers , the authorities discovered several documents written for Moreno González . The Army gave the documents to the intelligence agency SIEDO for further investigation .",

  "In some serpins , the S to R transition can activate cell signalling events . In these cases , a serpin that has formed a complex with its target protease , is then recognised by a receptor .

This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade .",
