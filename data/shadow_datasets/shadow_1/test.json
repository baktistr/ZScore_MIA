  "Before talks could begin , Coalition armies crossed the Rhine on 22 December . Metternich retired from Frankfurt to Breisgau to celebrate Christmas with his wife 's family before travelling to the new Coalition headquarters at Basel in January 1814 . Quarrels with Tsar Alexander , particularly over the fate of France intensified in January , prompting Alexander to storm out . He therefore missed the arrival of Castlereagh in mid @-@ January . Metternich and Castlereagh formed a good working relationship and then met with Alexander at Langres . The Tsar remained unaccommodating however , demanding a push into the centre of France ; fortunately , he was too preoccupied to object to Metternich 's other ideas , like a final peace conference in Vienna . Metternich did not attend talks with the French at Chatillon , as he wanted to stay with Alexander . The talks stalled , and , after a brief advance , Coalition forces had to retreat after the Montmirail and Montereau . This relieved Metternich 's fears that an overconfident Alexander might act unilaterally .",

  "The lack of an intrinsic magnetic field at Venus was surprising , given that it is similar to Earth in size , and was expected also to contain a dynamo at its core . A dynamo requires three things : a conducting liquid , rotation , and convection . The core is thought to be electrically conductive and , although its rotation is often thought to be too slow , simulations show it is adequate to produce a dynamo . This implies that the dynamo is missing because of a lack of convection in Venus 's core . On Earth , convection occurs in the liquid outer layer of the core because the bottom of the liquid layer is much hotter than the top . On Venus , a global resurfacing event may have shut down plate tectonics and led to a reduced heat flux through the crust . This caused the mantle temperature to increase , thereby reducing the heat flux out of the core . As a result , no internal geodynamo is available to drive a magnetic field . Instead , the heat from the core is being used to reheat the crust .",
  "In the aftermath of the war the Texan economy declined for a period .

Some former slaves were able to take advantage of ranching 's economic influence as some successful African American communities were established , including the \" Settlement \" in what is now League City .

  "Nest mate recognition is widespread in many eusocial insects . However , when there are no physical differences in either diet or nesting materials , many can no longer discriminate nest mate from other conspecifics . Recently , however , it has been indicated that many insects have the ability to discriminate relatives even having lived in identical environments with their non @-@ relative counterpart . Studies have indicated that in Polistes fuscatus , former nestmates would nest in areas located close together near their natal nests the following spring . Social halictid bees also are able to recognize their relatives . In Polistes exclamans , it has been indicated that discrimination of relatives from non @-@ relatives , even having lived in identical environments , is possible . This was found by Allen , Schulze Kellman , and Gamboa through an experiment in which hibernating wasps from different nests were put in a box together after being raised in identical environments . As the number of unrelated groups of wasps increased , the more clumps were formed in the box . This indicates that the wasps were capable of differentiating relative from nonrelative , an adaptive ability in the defense of their nest .",

  "In the first half of the 17th century , René Descartes ' mechanical philosophy encouraged the use of the metaphor of the universe as a machine , a concept that would come to characterise the scientific revolution . Between 1650 and 1800 , some naturalists , such as Benoît de Maillet , produced theories that maintained that the universe , the Earth , and life , had developed mechanically , without divine guidance . In contrast , most contemporary theories of evolution , such of those of Gottfried Leibniz and Johann Gottfried Herder , regarded evolution as a fundamentally spiritual process . In 1751 , Pierre Louis Maupertuis veered toward more materialist ground .

  "The Italian government refused to carry out death sentences , as the death penalty had been abolished in Italy in 1944 and was regarded as a relic of Mussolini 's Fascist regime . The Italian decision was very disappointing to the British government because the trials had partly been intended to meet the expectations of the Italian public . The War Office notified Lieutenant General Sir John Harding , who had succeeded Alexander as commander of British forces in the Mediterranean in 1946 , that there should be no more death sentences and those already imposed should be commuted . Accordingly , Harding commuted the death sentences imposed on von Mackensen , Mälzer and Kesselring to life imprisonment on 4 July 1947 . Mälzer died while still in prison in February 1952 , while von Mackensen , after having his sentence reduced to 21 years , was set free in October 1952 .

  "Inspired by Matchbox toys he played with as a child , Posehn decided to make the size of the game sprites resemble toys . Posehn contacted his friend , Tim Calvin , to assist with designing and creating the vehicle sprites . Though Calvin was a practising dentist at the time , he also had experience with 3D modelling . He rendered 3D models on a computer and reduced them to the desired size . Different views were obtained by rotating the models along a single axis . Calvin added colour to the sprites to meet the production staff 's specifications ; most required black , white , red , and blue , as well as four shades of colours like green and brown . Calvin eventually felt the rendering process was a waste of resources and attempted to create sprites on the pixel level himself without 3D models .

  "In July 1937 war broke out in northern China between China and Japan , and by August the fighting had spread to the city of Shanghai . After capturing Shanghai the Japanese Army decided on December 1 to continue its military campaign to the capital city of the Nationalist government of China , Nanking , which is roughly 300 kilometers west of Shanghai . Although the Japanese succeeded in surrounding Nanking and defeating the Chinese garrison stationed there by December 13 , few of the Chinese soldiers within the city formally surrendered . Instead they threw away their uniforms and weapons and hid among the city 's civilian population . Over the course of its subsequent occupation of Nanking the Japanese Army hunted down the former Chinese soldiers within the city and in a large number of cases summarily executed them . At the same time soldiers of the Japanese Army also committed random acts of murder against civilians , and engaged in rape , arson , and looting . These events are collectively known as the Nanking Massacre .",

  "John Scannella , in a paper presented in Bristol , UK at the conference of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology ( 25 September 2009 ) reclassified Torosaurus as especially mature Triceratops individuals , perhaps representing a single sex . Jack Horner , Scannella 's mentor at Bozeman Campus , Montana State University , noted that ceratopsian skulls consist of metaplastic bone . A characteristic of metaplastic bone is that it lengthens and shortens over time , extending and resorbing to form new shapes . Significant variety is seen even in those skulls already identified as Triceratops , Horner said , \" where the horn orientation is backwards in juveniles and forward in adults \" . Approximately 50 % of all subadult Triceratops skulls have two thin areas in the frill that correspond with the placement of \" holes \" in Torosaurus skulls , suggesting that holes developed to offset the weight that would otherwise have been added as maturing Triceratops individuals grew longer frills . A paper describing these findings in detail was published in July 2010 by Scannella and Horner . It formally argues that Torosaurus and the similar contemporary Nedoceratops are synonymous with Triceratops .",

Nevertheless , a Proclamation to estate @-@ holders was issued ( June 28 , 1848 ) , indicating that the reform was to be eventually enforced in exchange for unspecified sums , and calling on peasants to fulfill their corvées until autumn of the same year .",
  "Prior to the creation of the Canadian Heraldic Authority , Canadians wishing to obtain a legally granted coat of arms had to apply to one of the two heraldic offices in the United Kingdom : either the College of Arms in London or the Court of the Lord Lyon in Edinburgh . This process was quite lengthy — and costly . In addition , the heralds of the College of Arms and the Court of the Lord Lyon could sometimes be unfamiliar with Canadian history and symbols . In time , many Canadians with an interest in heraldry began calling for an office which would offer armorial bearings designed by and for Canadians .",
  "Although semi @-@ desert cacti may be exposed to high light levels in the wild , they may still need some shading when subjected to the higher light levels and temperatures of a greenhouse in summer .

  "Extensive testing of the M22 occurred in 1943 and 1944 , and was conducted by both the Ordnance Department and the British Armoured Fighting Vehicle ( AFV ) Gunnery School at Lulworth Ranges . These tests uncovered a number of faults and problems with the Locust . The AFV School noted that the process of loading the M22 into a C @-@ 54 transport aircraft took considerable time and involved the use of complex equipment . Overall the process took six untrained men 24 minutes , although it was believed this could be shortened with sufficient training . Unloading was also a long process , taking approximately ten minutes ; it was noted that the time it took to unload the M22 from a C @-@ 54 on the battlefield meant that both the tank and aircraft would make excellent targets for enemy fire . Operational use of the tank would therefore be restricted to the availability of airfields large enough to accommodate a fully laden C @-@ 54 , which might not be in the right geographical location or might even have to be captured in advance of a planned airborne operation . A heavy transport aircraft , the Fairchild C @-@ 82 Packet , was developed to specifically carry the M22 inside its fuselage and unload it through a set of clam @-@ shell doors , but it did not enter service until after the war had ended . The US Army Armored Board released a critical report on the Locust in September 1943 , stating that it was inadequate in the areas of reliability and durability , and indicating that it would not be able to be successfully used during airborne operations . By 1944 it was also realized that the design of the tank was actually obsolete . The armor of the M22 in several areas was found to be so thin that it was incapable of even resisting the armor @-@ piercing ammunition of a .50 caliber machine @-@ gun . Complaints were also made about the 37mm main armament , which was not powerful enough to penetrate the armor of most tanks used by the Axis powers . Similarly a report made on March 13 , 1944 by elements of the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment complained that when a high @-@ explosive shell was fired from the gun , the resulting shell @-@ burst was so weak that observers had difficulty in seeing where it impacted . There were also mechanical problems with the design , which caused it to be unreliable ; the engine was also found to be underpowered , possibly due to problems with the torque characteristics of the engine or an inefficient transmission system .",

  "Roughly a thousand years prior to the events of the series , Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer ( voiced by Martin Olson ) and a human woman ( voiced by Rebecca Sugar ) . Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere — a Hell @-@ like demon dimension — and subsists on the souls of sentient beings . For some reason , Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War , a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series . During this time , Simon Petrikov — the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown — found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up . The two developed a caring relationship , although the crown took a toll on Simon 's mental health , forcing him to leave Marceline alone . During this period in her life , she was reunited with her father , only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways . Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics , she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself . In the following years , Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans . She became their guardian and ally , and she helped them kill vampires , who had taken over much of the land . Marceline soon discovered that , upon killing a vampire , she was able to acquire their unique abilities . However , when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself , she was bitten . Although she eventually managed to slay him , she was turned in the process . At some point , she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash . The two would move into the Tree Fort , but their relationship would come to an end . Presumably , around this time , Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum ; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom 's elaborate rock candy mining complex . Eventually , however , Bubblegum pushed Marceline away , leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while .",

  "Among harem @-@ holding species , the adult females mate only with their harem stallion , while in other species , mating is more promiscuous and the males have larger testes for sperm competition . Estrous in female equines lasts 5 – 10 days ; physical signs include frequent urination , flowing muscus , and a swollen , everted labia . In addition , estrous females will stand with their hind legs spread and raise their tails when in the presence of a male . Males assess the female 's reproductive state with the flehmen response and the female will solicit mating by backing in . Length of gestation varies by species , it is roughly 11 to 13 months , and most mares will come into estrus again within a few days after foaling , depending on conditions . Usually , only a single foal is born , which is capable of running within an hour . Within a few weeks , foals will attempt to graze , but may continue to nurse for 8 – 13 months .

  "Only during Benjamin Mazar 's excavations between 1968 and 1977 was it discovered that the pier was in fact the western support of a single great arch . The uncovered pier , 15 @.@ 2 metres ( 50 ft ) long and 3 @.@ 6 metres ( 12 ft ) wide , was preserved to a height of 5 metres ( 16 ft ) . Within its base were found four small hollow spaces , possibly for shops opening onto the Herodian – era Tyropoeon street that passes beneath the arch . The lintels of these survive in place and are themselves arched to relieve pressure from the weight of the pier 's superstructure . Mazar 's excavations have revealed that the same pier was also the eastern external wall of a monumental building which Mazar suggested was the archives of Jerusalem mentioned by Josephus . South of the building , excavators found the remains of six vault – supporting piers , gradually decreasing in height southwards over a distance of 35 metres ( 115 ft ) . These vaults , the building and Robinson 's Arch , all supported a monumental flight of stairs which led the street up and over the Typropoeon street to the gate of the Royal Stoa at the top of the Temple Mount platform . Numerous stone steps , some still adjoined , were also found nearby .",

  "The Congo Free State was a corporate state in Central Africa privately owned by King Leopold II of Belgium founded and recognised by the Berlin Conference of 1885 . What would later become Abir Company territory was the land between the Lopori and Maringa river basins , tributaries of the Congo River , in the north of the state . The local populace here were yam and cassava farmers who engaged in trade with river fishermen and pygmy hunters . In 1885 a force of the Manyema people , followers of Tippu Tip , the Swahili @-@ Zanzibari slave trader , arrived at the head of the Lopori River from Stanley Falls . They took hostages from nearby villages to ransom in return for ivory . By 1892 they had enrolled local people into their army and controlled the entire eastern half of the basin . The Free State was concerned by this development and in 1889 had enacted the Monopoly Act which declared that all products in the area were to be under their jurisdiction alone . The Free State also began a campaign to drive the slavers , traders and the Manyema from the region , the first stage of which was the establishment of a supply post at Basankusu in May 1890 .

  "A modern variation of the teleological argument is built upon the concept of the fine @-@ tuned Universe : According to the website Biologos : \" Fine @-@ tuning refers to the surprising precision of nature ’ s physical constants , and the beginning state of the Universe . To explain the present state of the universe , even the best scientific theories require that the physical constants of nature and the beginning state of the Universe have extremely precise values . \" Also , the fine @-@ tuning of the Universe is the apparent delicate balance of conditions necessary for human life . In this view , speculation about a vast range of possible conditions in which life cannot exist is used to explore the probability of conditions in which life can and does exist .

  "Zosimus , a pagan writing at the turn of the 6th century , wrote a work titled the Historia Nova ( New History ) . Its detailed sections cover the period from the 3rd century AD to 410 . Zosimus , like all secular historians in his era , addressed himself to the governing class of the later Roman empire : officers , bureaucrats , and the landed aristocracy . There was relatively little overlap between the reading audience of secular histories and the ecclesiastical histories of Eusebius and his successors . For most of the period it covers , the Historia is the most valuable — and sometimes the only — available source . Zosimus ' history was written as a polemic , with the aim of establishing that barbarism and Christianity were the essential causes of the decline of the Roman state . Because of these themes , the Historia Nova is considered the first history of what moderns would call Rome 's \" decline and fall \" . Although skilled in literary rhetoric , Zosimus was a poor historian . He confuses dates and persons , is ignorant of geography , and treats his sources with naive simplicity . For the 3rd century , Zosimus follows Eunapius of Sardis and Olympiodorus of Thebes in Egypt . Since Eunapius ' history began in 272 , where the Chronicle of another historian , Dexippus , ended , Zosimus probably used Dexippus ' Chronicle , and perhaps his histories of the German wars between 250 and 270 . Dexippus , however , was as poor a historian as Zosimus . The surviving fragments of his work show an uncritical author , without strong sources , who prefers rhetoric to fact .

  "The Indonesian literary critic Jakob Sumardjo likewise notes money as the central issue of Allah jang Palsoe , writing that the play shows individuals doing anything to earn it — even sacrificing their values . He writes that the corrupting nature of money remains present in the best of times , and considers Kwee Tek Hoay 's message to have been too heavily based in morality rather than considerations of social and human factors . As a result , he writes , readers are brought to understand the lust for money as a \" human illness \" which must be overcome : they should follow the example of Tan Kioe Gie , not Tan Kioe Lie . John Kwee of the University of Auckland , citing Gie 's departure from Kamadjoean , suggests that this was a challenge directed at the Chinese Malay press , then becoming increasingly commercial .",

There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres ; the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8 % . However , this difference is related to the smooth plains and may be accidental . The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System . However , the color asymmetry of Titania is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system , possibly , from irregular satellites , which would be deposited predominately on the leading hemisphere .",

  "Because of the unusual success of the operas , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company were able , from the start , to license the works to other professional companies , such as the J. C.

Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that , prior to the creation of the Savoy operas , amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals .

With toilets only available at the John Tognela Rest Area near the southern end of the highway , travellers have reportedly stopped alongside the highway or side roads to urinate and change nappies .

  "The belief that witches could cure and cause harm was common among all social groups in early modern Scotland . In 1701 in Anstruther , Elizabeth Dick had been turned away from the local mill when begging . She cursed the mill and several witnesses testified that the grain in the mill turned red . Only when one of the people who had refused her help ran after her and gave her alms did she bless the mill and everything returned to normal . About half of accused witches had already gained a reputation for causing harm over a long period of time . The fact that only four per cent of recorded accused witches were involved in folk healing seems to indicate that healing was not seen as a major element of witchcraft . The Aberdeenshire trials of 1596 reveal that spells could be purchased from witches for success at fishing , to ensure a happy marriage , to prolong life and to affect the weather . Many accusations included gender and sexual fears . Margaret Bain , a midwife , it was claimed , could transfer the pains of childbirth to a woman 's husband and Helen Gray cast a spell on a man that gave him a permanent erection . Witches could also carry out divinations . These included by reading the marks on the shoulder blade of a slaughtered animal , measuring a person 's sleeve or waist to see if they were suffering from a fever , or being able to find answers based on which way a sieve suspended from scissors or shears swung , as Margaret Mungo was accused of doing before the kirk session of Dingwall in 1649 .",

  "Pain was one of Henry 's \" new men \" , who owed their positions and wealth to the king . The medieval writer Orderic Vitalis described them as a group as \" of base stock who had served him [ Henry ] well , raised them , so to say , from the dust \" and that the king \" stationed them above earls and famous castellans \" . Although Orderic stated that the families of these men were not considered high status , this likely was an exaggeration on the chronicler 's part . Pain 's family was respectable enough , as his father held a number of properties directly from the king . It appears that Pain did not always take the king 's side ; the historian C.

  "The historian Ian Wood has suggested that Mellitus ' journey through Gaul probably took in the bishoprics of Vienne , Arles , Lyons , Toulon , Marseilles , Metz , Paris , and Rouen , as evidenced by the letters that Gregory addressed to those bishops soliciting their support for Mellitus ' party . Gregory also wrote to the Frankish kings Chlothar II , Theuderic II , Theudebert II , along with Brunhilda of Austrasia , who was Theudebert and Theuderic 's grandmother and regent . Wood feels that this wide appeal to the Frankish episcopate and royalty was an effort to secure more support for the Gregorian mission . While on his journey to England , Mellitus received a letter from Gregory allowing Augustine to convert pagan temples to Christian churches , and to convert pagan animal sacrifices into Christian feasts , to ease the transition to Christianity . Gregory 's letter marked a sea change in the missionary strategy , and was later included in Bede 's Ecclesiastical History of the English People . Usually known as the Epistola ad Mellitum , it conflicts with the letter sent to Æthelberht , which the historian R. A. Markus sees as a turning point in missionary history , when forcible conversion gave way to persuasion . This traditional view , that the Epistola represents a contradiction of the letter to Æthelberht , has been challenged by the historian and theologian George Demacopoulos , who argues that the letter to Æthelberht was mainly meant to encourage the King in spiritual matters , while the Epistola was sent to deal with purely practical matters , and thus the two do not contradict each other .",
  "The name \" cookiecutter shark \" refers to its feeding habit of gouging round plugs , as if cut out with a cookie cutter , out of larger animals . Marks made by cookiecutter sharks have been found on a wide variety of marine mammals and fishes , as well as on submarines , undersea cables , and even human bodies . It also consumes whole smaller prey such as squid . Cookiecutter sharks have adaptations for hovering in the water column and likely rely on stealth and subterfuge to capture more active prey . Its dark collar seems to mimic the silhouette of a small fish , while the rest of its body blends into the downwelling light via its ventral photophores . When a would @-@ be predator approaches the lure , the shark attaches itself using its suctorial lips and specialized pharynx and neatly excises a chunk of flesh using its bandsaw @-@ like set of lower teeth .

  "Andronikos I was the last of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople , although his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204 . Nevertheless , Andronikos 's role in the collapse of the empire is controversial ; historians disagree over the extent to which his brief reign influenced events after his death . Andonikos 's coup , together with his violent death , had weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely . Furthermore , his so @-@ called ' anti @-@ Latin ' policy has been criticised by some historians as a failure , in view of the increasing hostility it caused towards Byzantium in the west . In particular , Andonikos 's failure to prevent the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 has been seen as especially significant , since henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti @-@ Latin in the west . It has even been argued that Andronikos 's attempts to crush the aristocracy were damaging to the empire 's military power , since the aristocracy had become indispensable to the defences of the state . On the other hand , his reforms in the provinces were both wise and beneficial to the internal health and prosperity of the empire .",

  "In his literature , and in his personal writing , Hemingway habitually used the word \" and \" in place of commas . This use of polysyndeton may serve to convey immediacy .

  "Cleveland 's military policy emphasized self @-@ defense and modernization . In 1885 Cleveland appointed the Board of Fortifications under Secretary of War William C. Endicott to recommend a new coastal fortification system for the United States . No improvements to US coastal defenses had been made since the late 1870s . The Board 's 1886 report recommended a massive $ 127 million construction program at 29 harbors and river estuaries , to include new breech @-@ loading rifled guns , mortars , and naval minefields . The Board and the program are usually called the Endicott Board and the Endicott Program . Most of the Board 's recommendations were implemented , and by 1910 27 locations were defended by over 70 forts . Many of the weapons remained in place until scrapped in World War II as they were replaced with new defenses . Endicott also proposed to Congress a system of examinations for Army officer promotions . For the Navy , the Cleveland administration spearheaded by Secretary of the Navy William Collins Whitney moved towards modernization , although no ships were constructed that could match the best European warships . Although completion of the four steel @-@ hulled warships begun under the previous administration was delayed due to a corruption investigation and subsequent bankruptcy of their building yard , these ships were completed in a timely manner in naval shipyards once the investigation was over . Sixteen additional steel @-@ hulled warships were ordered by the end of 1888 ; these ships later proved vital in the Spanish – American War of 1898 , and many served in World War I. These ships included the \" second @-@ class battleships \" Maine and Texas , designed to match modern armored ships recently acquired by South American countries from Europe , such as the Brazilian battleship Riachuelo . Eleven protected cruisers ( including the famous Olympia ) , one armored cruiser , and one monitor were also ordered , along with the experimental cruiser Vesuvius .",

  "The favoured model for the enzyme – substrate interaction is the induced fit model . This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak , but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding . These conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the active site close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction . Conformational changes can be measured using circular dichroism or dual polarisation interferometry . After binding takes place , one or more mechanisms of catalysis lower the energy of the reaction 's transition state by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction . Mechanisms of catalysis include catalysis by bond strain ; by proximity and orientation ; by active @-@ site proton donors or acceptors ; covalent catalysis and quantum tunnelling .",

There are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process ; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger cell death , but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages . An internal process of natural selection occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth , creating a cancerous tumor that grows and invades various tissues of the body .",

  "Edwards ' trial was in June 1842 and was a media sensation . He secured a defense team of six lawyers , including John J. Crittenden , a sitting U. S. Senator , and Thomas F.

Evarts , who presented the opening remarks for the defense . Another defense lawyer was John Worth Edmonds , who Edwards paid with a forged check . Edwards ' handsome appearance worked against him , when one of the bankers who had cashed the drafts identified him in court and remarked that he remembered Edwards because of his striking good looks . Edwards had also neglected to dispose of a marked bank bag from one of the banks that cashed the fraudulently obtained draft .

As private equity reemerged in the 1990s it began to earn a new degree of legitimacy and respectability .

In the original Russian text , the names of the major characters have something of a double meaning , but in translation the subtlety of the Russian language is predominately lost due to major differences in the language structure and culture . For example , the original title ( \" Преступление и наказание \" ) is not the direct equivalent to the English . \" Преступление \" is literally translated as a stepping across . The physical image of crime as a crossing over a barrier or a boundary is lost in translation . So is the religious implication of transgression , which in English refers to a sin rather than a crime .",

These recordings were to make up the musical soundtrack for the reconceived Pistols feature film project , directed by Julian Temple , to which McLaren was now devoting himself . On 30 June , a single credited to the Sex Pistols was released : on one side , notorious criminal Ronnie Biggs sang \" No One Is Innocent \" accompanied by Jones and Cook ; on the other , Vicious sang the classic \" My Way \" , over both a Jones – Cook backing track and a string orchestra .

  "The cookiecutter shark regularly replaces its teeth like other sharks , but sheds its lower teeth in entire rows rather than one at a time . A cookiecutter shark 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) long has been calculated to have shed 15 sets of lower teeth by the time it is 50 cm ( 20 in ) long , totaling 435 – 465 teeth . This represents a significant investment of resources and is probably why the shark swallows its old sets of teeth , so that it can recycle the calcium content . Unlike other sharks , the retina of the cookiecutter shark has ganglion cells concentrated in a concentric area rather than in a horizontal streak across the visual field ; this may help to focus on prey in front of the shark . This fat shark has been known to travel in schools , which may increase the effectiveness of its lure ( see below ) , as well as discourage counterattacks by much larger predators .",

Silverman was quick to mention that she had not previously played the game to which the series was based on . With that being said , she described the first episode as not feeling like a game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play . She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive . She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s . In her full series review , Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used . Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong , Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down . She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise . On the other hand , Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change .",

  "The The Indian Princess has been cited as the first well @-@ documented case of a play that was originally performed in America being subsequently staged in England . Although records indicate there was a play called Pocahontas ; or the Indian Princess , credited as being adapted by T.A. Cooper , that played The Theatre Royal at Drury Lane in London on December 15 , 1820 , and subsequently on December 16 and December 19 , the piece differed drastically from Barker 's original and featured a completely different cast of characters . Barker himself wrote that the production was done without his permission or even his knowledge , and based on a critical response he read of the London performance , he deduced that there was very little in the play that was his own . Other evidence suggests that the script used in England was not only a completely different play , but that it was likely not even originated by an American . This assertion is based primarily on three factors : the kinder and meeker portrayal of the Natives , which reduces the grandeur of the play 's American heroes , the more vague listing of the setting as \" North America \" rather than specifically \" Virginia , \" and the lack of implications about America 's great destiny that was evident in Barker 's version . The distinction between the London and American versions is also supported by a review of the London production , in which the reviewer cites a lack of comic characters ( Barker ’ s version included several ) , and the presence of a character named “ Opechancaough , ” who is nowhere to be found in Barker ’ s play .",

  "The situation changed dramatically with the French military expedition to Egypt in 1798 , which brought with it a corps of scholars to examine the surviving ancient monuments . The results of their study inspired a fascination with ancient Egypt throughout Europe . In the early nineteenth century , growing numbers of Europeans traveled to Egypt , both to see the ancient monuments and to collect Egyptian antiquities . Many temple artifacts , from small objects to massive obelisks , were removed by outside governments and private collectors . This wave of Egyptomania resulted in the rediscovery of temple sites such as Abu Simbel , but artifacts and even whole temples were often treated with great carelessness . The discoveries of the period did , however , make possible the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs and the beginnings of Egyptology as a scholarly discipline .",

  "Central nervous system oxygen toxicity manifests as symptoms such as visual changes ( especially tunnel vision ) , ringing in the ears ( tinnitus ) , nausea , twitching ( especially of the face ) , behavioural changes ( irritability , anxiety , confusion ) , and dizziness . This may be followed by a tonic – clonic seizure consisting of two phases : intense muscle contraction occurs for several seconds ( tonic phase ) ; followed by rapid spasms of alternate muscle relaxation and contraction producing convulsive jerking ( clonic phase ) . The seizure ends with a period of unconsciousness ( the postictal state ) . The onset of seizure depends upon the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas and exposure duration . However , exposure time before onset is unpredictable , as tests have shown a wide variation , both amongst individuals , and in the same individual from day to day . In addition , many external factors , such as underwater immersion , exposure to cold , and exercise will decrease the time to onset of central nervous system symptoms . Decrease of tolerance is closely linked to retention of carbon dioxide . Other factors , such as darkness and caffeine , increase tolerance in test animals , but these effects have not been proven in humans .",

Although his performance was no worse than that of others , he was dropped from the team for the rest of the series and did not play another Test for five years . At the time , it was suggested his place was lost because he was uncomfortable against the fast bowling of Jack Gregory and Ted McDonald , who devastated and demoralised many English batsmen during the season .

Critics complained that this method was ugly ; it restricted the shots that could be made , and led to some batsmen using their pads as an extra form of defence to stop the ball hitting the wicket . According to his Wisden obituary , Rhodes was one of the first men to adopt this batting stance . Rhodes faced a further development following the retirements of Hirst and Denton from Yorkshire ; he became the county 's senior professional .

  "Velázquez 's portrait is a staging of a private moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep and intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus . However , the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude — without jewellery or any of the goddess 's usual accessories — was echoed in later nude studies by Ingres , Manet , and Baudry , among others . In addition , Velázquez 's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time , although the pose has been painted by many later artists . Manet , in his stark female portrayal Olympia , paraphrased the Rokeby Venus in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an ethereal goddess . Olympia shocked the Parisian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863 . Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer , as does Velázquez 's Venus , only through the reflection of the mirror .",

  "The exact cause of HSP is unknown , but most of its features are due to the deposition of abnormal antibodies in the wall of blood vessels , leading to vasculitis . These antibodies are of the subclass IgA1 in polymers ; it is uncertain whether the main cause is overproduction ( in the digestive tract or the bone marrow ) or decreased removal of abnormal IgA from the circulation . It is suspected that abnormalities in the IgA1 molecule may provide an explanation for its abnormal behaviour in both HSP and the related condition IgA nephropathy . One of the characteristics of IgA1 ( and IgD ) is the presence of an 18 amino acid @-@ long \" hinge region \" between complement @-@ fixating regions 1 and 2 . Of the amino acids , half is proline , while the others are mainly serine and threonine .

  "Although most cells have other enzymes that can degrade RNA , either from the 3 ' or from the 5 ' end of the RNA , the exosome complex is essential for cell survival . When the expression of exosome proteins is artificially reduced or stopped , for example by RNA interference , growth stops and the cells eventually die . Both the core proteins of the exosome complex , as well as the two main associated proteins , are essential proteins . Bacteria do not have an exosome complex ; however , similar functions are performed by a simpler complex that includes the protein PNPase , called the degradosome .",

  "Considerable expansion occurred during the last two decades of the 12th century and the first two or three decades of the 13th century . The south and west ranges were demolished and rebuilt , enlarging the cloister from about 36 feet ( 11 m ) by 32 feet ( 10 m ) to about 56 feet ( 17 m ) by 52 feet ( 16 m ) . This meant that a door in the south wall of the church had to be blocked off and a new highly decorated doorway was built at the northeast corner of the cloister ; this doorway has survived . The lower storey of the west range , the other standing remains of the priory , also dates from this period ; it comprises the cellarer 's undercroft and a passage to its north , known as the outer parlour . The outer parlour had been the entrance to the priory from the outside world , and was \" sumptuously decorated \" so that \" the power and wealth of the priory could be displayed in tangible fashion to those coming from the secular world \" .

  "A number of shortcomings in planning and execution contributed to the debacle suffered by the Confederates . The Confederate brigade leaders performed well , with the exception of a few minor instances ; Burton surmises that the blame of July 1 must lie with the overall commanders . James Longstreet was overconfident about the artillery strategy , which proved less effective than it could have been largely because both he and Stonewall Jackson had problems gathering the artillery for the assault . The Confederate practice of moving artillery with individual units instead of in one mass and the difficult terrain surrounding Malvern Hill contributed to this issue . A potential solution to this problem lay with Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton 's fourteen batteries in reserve . However , Lee 's headquarters never contacted Pendleton , who spent July 1 \" await [ ing ] events and orders , in readiness for whatever service might be called for . \" These orders never came , and Pendleton 's batteries went unused . Magruder might also share in the blame ; his late arrival to the battlefield was caused by bad maps and faulty guides . Since Magruder received Chilton 's draft late in the day , and with no time attached to it , there was no way for him to determine the relevance of the order . Burton suggests that Magruder cannot be reasonably blamed for his attacks on the Union line : he was responding to Lee 's orders and did initially try to form a unified attack on the Union line . Finally , Magruder was riding back and forth across the battlefield , making it difficult for him to be found by junior officers seeking guidance . Several other factors may have played into the Confederate repulse , including Theophilus Holmes 's refusal to participate in the battle , dismissing any notion of actively engaging the enemy .",

Fingleton was caught by the wicketkeeper without scoring . The third over of the innings was bowled by Larwood with fielders still in orthodox positions . The fifth ball narrowly missed Woodfull 's head and the final ball , delivered short on the line of middle stump , struck Woodfull over the heart . The batsman dropped his bat and staggered away holding his chest , bent over in pain . The England players surrounded Woodfull to offer sympathy but the crowd began to protest noisily .

However , when Larwood was ready to bowl at Woodfull again , play was halted once more when the fielders were moved into Bodyline positions , causing the crowd to protest and call abuse at the England team . Subsequently , Jardine claimed that Larwood requested a field change , Larwood said that Jardine had done so .

  "At the beginning of Empress Dowager Deng 's regency , the Protector General of the Western Regions Ren Shang ( d . 118 CE ) was besieged at Kashgar . Although he was able to break the siege , he was recalled and replaced before the Empress Dowager began to withdraw forces from the Western Regions in 107 CE . However , a transitional force was still needed . The Qiang people , who had been settled by the Han government in southeastern Gansu since Emperor Jing 's reign , would aid Han in this withdrawal . Throughout Eastern Han , the Qiang often revolted against Han authority after Han border officials robbed them of goods and even women and children . A group of Qiang people conscripted to reinforce the Protector General during his withdrawal decided instead to mutiny against him . Their revolt in the northwestern province of Liang ( 涼州 ) was put down in 108 CE , but it spurred a greater Qiang rebellion that would last until 118 CE , cutting off Han 's access to Central Asia . The Qiang problem was exacerbated in 109 CE by a combined Southern Xiongnu , Xianbei , and Wuhuan rebellion in the northeast . The total monetary cost for putting down the Qiang rebellion in Liang province was 24 million cash ( out of an average of 220 million cash minted annually ) , while the people of three entire commanderies within eastern Liang province and one commandery within Bing province were temporarily resettled in 110 CE .",

  "In 1808 , Cuvier identified a fossil found in Maastricht as a giant marine reptile that would later be named Mosasaurus . He also identified , from a drawing , another fossil found in Bavaria as a flying reptile and named it Pterodactylus . He speculated , based on the strata in which these fossils were found , that large reptiles had lived prior to what he was calling \" the age of mammals \" . Cuvier 's speculation would be supported by a series of finds that would be made in Great Britain over the course of the next two decades . Mary Anning , a professional fossil collector since age eleven , collected the fossils of a number of marine reptiles from the Jurassic marine strata at Lyme Regis . These included the first ichthyosaur skeleton to be recognized as such , which was collected in 1811 , and the first two plesiosaur skeletons ever found in 1821 and 1823 . Many of her discoveries would be described scientifically by the geologists William Conybeare , Henry De la Beche , and William Buckland . It was Anning who observed that stony objects known as \" bezoar stones \" were often found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons , and she noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilized fish bones and scales as well as sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs . This led her to suggest to Buckland that they were fossilized feces , which he named coprolites , and which he used to better understand ancient food chains .",

  "Mercyful Fate were a part of the first wave of black metal , along with other groups , such as Venom , Bathory and Hellhammer . Many of these groups helped establish the style upon which future black metal artists would later build . Unlike the other first wave bands , typical elements of Mercyful Fate 's style are influences from progressive rock , epic 1970s hard rock and traditional heavy metal .

The music of Def Leppard , Praying Mantis , White Spirit , Demon , Shy , Gaskin , Dedringer and many others , contained hooks as much as riffs , often retained a closer link with blues rock , included power ballads and featured keyboards , acoustic instruments and melodic and soaring vocals . After the peak of the movement in 1981 , this style was favoured by the media and gained greater acceptance among the British audience ; it became prevalent when bands usually playing the more aggressive style of metal adapted to the more popular sound , which resembled that of mainstream American acts . These changes in musical direction disoriented some fans and led them to reject those bands which were perceived as having compromised key elements of their musical identity in the pursuit of success .",

  "The school is run as a democracy , with students deciding affairs that range from the curriculum to the behavior code . Lessons are non @-@ compulsory . Neill emphasizes \" self @-@ regulation \" , personal responsibility , freedom from fear , \" freedom in sex play \" , and loving understanding over moral instruction or force . In his philosophy , all attempts to mold children are coercive in nature and therefore harmful . Caretakers are advised to \" trust \" in the natural process and let children self @-@ regulate such that they live by their own rules and consequently treat with the highest respect the rights of others to live by their own rules .

Children can do as they please until their actions affect others . In an example , a student can skip French class to play music , but cannot disruptively play music during the French class . Against the popular image of \" go as you please schools \" , Summerhill has many rules . However , they are decided at a schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote apiece . This does not necessarily mean total cessation to the children , as Neill thought adults were right to bemoan child destruction of property . He considered this tension between adult and child living styles to be natural .

  "\" Treehouse of Horror II \" , the second edition of the Treehouse of Horror series of episodes , was written by Al Jean , Mike Reiss , Jeff Martin , George Meyer , Sam Simon , and John Swartzwelder . Jim Reardon was the director . The episode is presented in a similar format to the previous season 's \" Treehouse of Horror \" , and contains several similarities to the previous episode , such as Marge 's opening warning , the tombstones in the opening credits and the appearance of the alien characters Kang and Kodos . \" Treehouse of Horror II \" was the first episode that employed the \" scary names \" idea , in which many of the names in the opening and closing credits have unusual nicknames . The idea came from Al Jean , who was inspired by old issues of EC Comics . Although the names quickly became more silly than scary , there has been a wide variety of special credits . For example , the director 's name is given as Jim \" Rondo \" Reardon , a reference to his idol , Rondo Hatton . The \" scary names \" became such a burden to write that they were cut for \" Treehouse of Horror XII \" and \" Treehouse of Horror XIII \" , but after hearing complaints from the fans , Jean decided to bring them back . The alien characters Kang and Kodos had been introduced in the previous year . There was a debate about whether to include them in all Halloween specials after the episode ; eventually , the writers agreed to make it a tradition .",

  "The Astros traded Caminiti to the San Diego Padres before the 1995 season . With Caminiti no longer blocking his path to the major leagues , Nevin hoped he would be named the Astros ' starting third baseman . But the Astros did not invite him to spring training . Nevin attributed the snub to his refusal to work out with replacement players during the work stoppage . Not wanting to be seen as \" scabs \" by the Major League Baseball Players Association , minor league players who felt they would play in MLB after the resolution of the strike felt pressure to avoid playing with replacement players , while career minor @-@ leaguers were happy to get a taste of the major leagues . When prospects including Nevin and Billy Wagner refused to play with the replacement players , Astros ' general manager Bob Watson issued an ultimatum , saying anyone who refused to play in the team 's first exhibition game would be sent out of camp until further notice and be held in breach of contract . The Astros sent Nevin back to Tucson to start the 1995 season , while Dave Magadan started at third base on Opening Day . The Astros also planned to use Shipley and Chris Donnels at third base .",
  "The Silver Seven moved between three leagues during this time , and for a time were independent of any league . In February 1904 , during the CAHL season , Ottawa resigned from the league in a dispute over the replaying of a game . The team had arrived late for a game in Montreal and the game had been called at midnight , with a tied score . The league demanded that the game be replayed . The club agreed to play only if the game mattered in the standings . The impasse led to Ottawa leaving the league . For the rest of that winter , the club played only in Cup challenge series . Quebec went on to win the championship of the league and demanded the Stanley Cup , but the Cup 's trustees ruled that Ottawa still retained it . The trustees offered to arrange a challenge between Ottawa and the CAHL champion , but the CAHL refused to consider it . The next season , Ottawa joined the Federal Amateur Hockey League ( FAHL ) , winning the league championship . The club was only in the FAHL for one season , and the Montreal Wanderers became their new rival . For the 1906 season Ottawa , along with the Wanderers and several of the CAHL teams , formed the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ( ECAHA ) , unifying the top teams into one league .",
  "Whorf 's study of Hopi time has been the most widely discussed and criticized example of linguistic relativity . In his analysis he argues that there is a relation between how the Hopi people conceptualize time , how they speak of temporal relations , and the grammar of the Hopi language . Whorf 's most elaborate argument for the existence of linguistic relativity was based on what he saw as a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi . He argued that the Hopi language , in contrast to English and other SAE languages , does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct countable instances , like \" three days \" or \" five years \" , but rather as a single process . Because of this difference , the language lacks nouns that refer to units of time . He proposed that the Hopi view of time was fundamental in all aspects of their culture and furthermore explained certain patterns of behavior . In his 1939 memorial essay to Sapir he wrote that “ ... the Hopi language is seen to contain no words , grammatical forms , construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call ' time ' , or to past , present , or future ... ”",

  "Fresh snow reflects 90 % or more of ultraviolet radiation , which causes snow blindness , also reducing absorption of sunlight by the ground . Snow blindness ( also known as ultraviolet keratitis , photokeratitis or niphablepsia ) is a painful eye condition , caused by exposure of unprotected eyes to the ultraviolet ( UV ) rays in bright sunlight reflected from snow or ice . This condition is a problem in polar regions and at high altitudes , as with every 300 meters ( 980 ft ) of elevation ( above sea level ) , the intensity of UV rays increases by 4 % . Snow 's large reflection of light makes night skies much brighter , since reflected light is directed back up into the sky . However , when there is also cloud cover , light is then reflected back to the ground . This greatly amplifies light emitted from city lights , causing the ' bright night ' effect . A similar brightening effect occurs when no snow is falling and there is a full moon and a large amount of snow .",

  "Describing aspects of Michael Myers which he wanted to explore in the comic book Halloween : Nightdance , writer Stefan Hutchinson mentions the character 's \" bizarre and dark sense of humor \" , as seen when he wore a sheet over his head to trick a girl into thinking he was her boyfriend , and the satisfaction he gets from scaring the characters before he murders them , such as letting Laurie know he is stalking her . Hutchinson feels there is a perverse nature to Michael 's actions : \" see the difference between how he watches and pursues women to men \" . He also suggests that Michael Myers ' hometown of Haddonfield is the cause of his behavior , likening his situation to that of Jack the Ripper , citing Myers as a \" product of normal surburbia - all the repressed emotion of fake Norman Rockwell smiles \" . Hutchinson describes Michael as a \" monster of abjection \" . When asked his opinion of Rob Zombie 's expansion on Michael 's family life , Hutchinson says that explaining why Michael does what he does \" [ reduces ] the character \" . That being said , Hutchinson explores the nature of evil in the short story Charlie — included in the Halloween Nightdance trade paperback — and says that Michael Myers spent fifteen years \" attuning himself to this force to the point where he is , as Loomis says , ' pure evil ' \" . Nightdance artist Tim Seeley describes the character 's personality in John Carpenter 's 1978 film as \" a void \" , which allows the character to be more open to interpretation than the later sequels allowed him . He surmises that Michael embodies a part of everyone ; a part people are afraid will one day \" snap and knife someone \" , which lends to the fear that Michael creates on screen .",

Until then , Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together , and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them . In May 1996 , Wiggs revealed that she would not be involved in any immediate Breeders activity ; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul , to be close to her rehabilitation facility .

  "Some animals including cephalopods like squid are able to vary their colours rapidly for both camouflage and signalling .

When charge is absent , the proteins stack together tightly , forming a thin , more reflective layer ; when charge is present , the molecules stack more loosely , forming a thicker layer . Since chromatophores contain multiple reflectin layers , the switch changes the layer spacing and hence the colour of light that is reflected .",

  "During the night of 5 – 6 November , fighting died down after a ceasefire was brokered in The Hague . The lull was used by the 137th Infantry Brigade to extract its encircled troops and civilians near the Korana River , east of Malići . The JNA column began moving south again at dawn ; it reached Malići at about 9 : 00 a.m. , crossed the Korana River ( over the village bridge and a pontoon bridge ) by 11 : 00 and proceeded to Vojnić .

  "The Incredible Melting Man was written and directed by filmmaker William Sachs . The idea for the film came to him when his mother , working in the office of a spray paint company , showed him \" gooey stuff \" which was used as a basis for spray paint and jokingly suggested that he should do a film featuring that material . During writing , Sachs was influenced by The Night of the Living Dead and wanted to give the film a 1950s horror film feeling . The final film , with its structure changed by the producers in post @-@ production , has been described by some sources – including the film magazine Cinefantastique and the 1995 book Cult Science Fiction Films – as a remake of First Man into Space ( 1959 ) , another film about an astronaut who becomes a monster after an accident in space . Science fiction film historian Gene Wright suggested that the final film was heavily influenced by The Quatermass Xperiment ( 1955 ) , a British horror film about an astronaut who begins mutating into an alien organism after a spaceflight . Sachs , however , had not seen those films and his original screenplay had a very different structure . He wrote The Incredible Melting Man originally as a parody of horror films . According to Michael Adams , a film reviewer who interviewed Sachs , this is why the film mixes horror with comedic moments , such as when Steve West 's detached ear gets stuck on a tree , and when a janitor sweeps West 's melted body into a garbage can at the end of the film . Adams claims that this explains several comedic lines of dialogue otherwise inconsistent with the rest of the film , including one moment when homeless men notice the melting West and say to each other , \" You think we 've got trouble , look at that dude \" . In Sachs ' original version , the film opened with the wide @-@ angle shot of the nurse running through the hallway ( which wouldn 't have been in slow motion , unlike the final film , where the producers played it back slowed down ) . Only later would viewers have gradually learned the background of the melting man . All the scenes showing the astronauts in space and the lead character in the hospital were re @-@ shot during post @-@ production without influence by the director , and Sachs criticized both the acting in those scenes and how they restructure the film . There are logical problems in the final film due to the re @-@ shot scenes ; it is never fully explained how West 's spacecraft returned to Earth from Saturn when West himself was so seriously injured and the other two members of his crew were both killed .",

  "Around the turn of the twentieth century , the influence of Characters began to be exerted more explicitly , notably in the studies of critic A.C. Bradley , who approvingly adopted Hazlitt 's explanation of the character of Iago . At about this time , George Saintsbury , who wrote a comprehensive history of English criticism ( finished in 1904 ) , recorded his extreme distaste for Hazlitt 's character , and , as noted by critic Elisabeth Schneider , found his writings \" filled with vast ignorance , errors , prejudice , and an unpleasantness of temper amounting almost to insanity \" . Yet he also ranked Hazlitt high as a critic , among the greatest in the language . Characters he placed lower than some of Hazlitt 's other critical works ; yet he allowed that , aside from such \" outbursts \" as his railing against the historical King Henry V , and his over @-@ reliance on quotation from Schlegel , Characters of Shakespear 's Plays is filled with much that is admirable , notably Hazlitt 's comparison of Chaucer 's and Shakespeare 's characterisation and his observation that Shakespeare \" has no prejudices for or against his characters \" . Saintsbury found Hazlitt 's critical judgements sound as a rule , and he thought that the characterisations of Falstaff and Shylock were \" masterpieces \" .",

  "The novelist Evelyn Waugh had been familiar with the Diary since his childhood . It was a great favourite of his parents — Arthur Waugh used to read passages aloud to his family , and Evelyn 's biographer Selena Hastings has drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household . Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book , but grew to admire it , to the extent of writing in his 1930 essay \" One Way to Immortality \" that it was \" the funniest book in the world \" . He added : \" Nobody wants to read other people 's reflections on life and religion and politics , but the routine of their day , properly recorded , is always interesting , and will become more so as conditions change with the years \" . Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh 's early novels , though socially far removed from the Pooters , share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of a changing world . In his 1945 novel Brideshead Revisited , Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from the Diary \" with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression \" . Morton suggests that one of the work 's attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin , and the way in which the disapproved son ( as Waugh saw himself ) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage .",
