  "Bertin is presented as strong , energetic and warm @-@ hearted . His hair is grey verging on white , his fingers spread across his knees . Bertin 's fingers were described in 1959 by artist Henry de Waroquier as \" crab @-@ like claws ... emerging from the tenebrous caverns that are the sleeves of his coat . \" The bulk of his body is compacted in a tight black jacket , black trousers and brown satin waistcoat , with a starched white shirt and cravat revealing his open neck . He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket . In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum , his \" nearly ferocious presence \" is accentuated by the tightly constrained space . The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him . His coiled , stubby fingers rest on his thighs , barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket , while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow starched white collar .",

  "Initially , the relationship between price level and output was explained by the quantity theory of money ; David Hume had presented such a theory in his 1752 work Of Money ( Essays , Moral , Political , and Literary , Part II , Essay III ) . Quantity theory viewed the entire economy through Say 's law , which stated that whatever is supplied to the market will be sold — in short , that markets always clear . In this view , money is neutral and cannot impact the real factors in an economy like output levels . This was consistent with the classical dichotomy view that real aspects of the economy and nominal factors , such as price levels and money supply , can be considered independent from one another . For example , adding more money to an economy would be expected only to raise prices , not to create more goods .",
  "The dictator novel is a genre that has developed as a vehicle for Latin American writers to critique concentrated authority . Assistant Professor of Spanish at Walsh University , Jorge J Barrueto , argues that El Señor Presidente has been heralded as epitomizing dictatorship , \" a phenomenon perceived to be a natural and inherent trait in the region \" . According to Garcia Calderon , the legacy of colonialism in Latin America has often led to the rise of an absolute authority , which seeks to contain a nation 's inner conflict . Once in power , the man in charge often seeks complete control ; he often amends constitutions , dismantling laws which previously prevented his re @-@ election . For example , in 1899 General Manuel Estrada Cabrera altered the Guatemalan Constitution which had previously prohibited his re @-@ election . Typically , however , dictator novels attempt to examine the abstract nature of authority figures and to question the idea of authority in general instead of focusing on the rule of a particular dictator .",

  "Climax Studios began with the game 's plot , which the development team considered the main appeal of the series . Early in the game 's development , some team members visited a psychiatrist for research . The use of ice as a visual theme originated partly because the developers wanted to create an Otherworld for the game , as previous games in the series had featured the same theme as Silent Hill , and because snowfall is common in the northeastern or midwestern United States , where the fictional town is located . Falling snow was added to limit the player 's visibility and build an atmosphere of dread . The developers included a system of psychological profiling that adjusted gameplay elements based on the player 's interaction with the game . Writer Sam Barlow explained the system : \" ultimately every little thing you do in the game or piece of content you can interact with can be assigned a little personality score . This is all added into a very classical psychometric profile of your personality that can then be mapped onto research . \" The opening questionnaire has little significance in the player 's profile . Capturing the multiple variations of gameplay elements for submission to the Entertainment Software Rating Board proved to be difficult , according to the game 's producer , Tomm Hulett .

  "Although science fiction had been published before the 1920s , it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories , a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback .

Lord Reid wrote , \" A statutory provision is impliedly repealed if a later enactment brings to an end a state of things the continuance of which is essential for its operation . \" In contrast , Lord Wilberforce , another Lord of Appeal in Ordinary , disagreed that a major enactment such as the Act of Union could be repealed by implication .

  "In 1815 , the Swedish chemist Jöns Jakob Berzelius analysed an unusual sample of gadolinite from a copper mine in Falun , central Sweden .

However , this became \" xenotime \" as a misprint from the beginning , blunting the criticism . This misspelt form was later explained as being from ξενός ( stranger to ) and τιμή ( honour ) , supposedly referencing the small , rare and easily overlooked crystals that xenotime occurs as .

  "Contemporary accounts described Henry VI as peaceful and pious , not suited for the violent dynastic civil wars , such as the War of the Roses . He had periods of insanity while his inherent benevolence eventually required his wife , Margaret of Anjou , to assume control of his kingdom , which contributed to his own downfall . His ineffectual rule had encouraged the nobles ' schemes to establish control over him , and the situation deteriorated into a civil war between the supporters of his house and those of Richard , Duke of York . After the Yorkists captured Henry in 1460 , the English parliament passed an Act of Accord to let York and his line succeed Henry as king . Henry 's consort , Margaret of Anjou , refused to accept the dispossession of her son 's right to the throne and , along with fellow Lancastrian malcontents , raised an army . Richard of York was killed at the Battle of Wakefield and his titles , including the claim to the throne , passed to his eldest son Edward . Nobles who were previously hesitant to support Richard 's claim to the throne considered the Lancastrians to have reneged on the Act — a legal agreement — and Edward found enough backing to denounce Henry and declare himself king . The Battle of Towton was to affirm the victor 's right to rule over England through force of arms .",

Like Albert Gerard would argue later in 1944 , Garrod believed that the problem within Keats 's poem was his emphasis on the rhythm and the language instead of the main ideas of the poem .

He concluded on the stanza that \" I do not believe that any reader who has watched Keats at work on the more exquisitely finished of the stanzas in The Eve of St. Agnes , and seen this craftsman slowly elaborating and refining , will ever believe that this perfect stanza was achieved with the easy fluency with which , in the draft we have , it was obviously written down . \" In 1936 , F.

  "Female homosexual behavior may be present in every culture , although the concept of a lesbian as a woman who pairs exclusively with other women is not . Attitudes about female homosexual behavior are dependent upon women 's roles in each society , and each culture 's definition of sex .

  "The statements about the obligatory nature of the terms of language have been taken to suggest that Whorf meant that language completely determined the scope of possible conceptualizations . However neo @-@ Whorfians argue that here Whorf is writing about the terms in which we speak of the world , not the terms in which we think of it . Whorf noted that to communicate thoughts and experiences with members of a speech community speakers must use the linguistic categories of their shared language , which requires moulding experiences into the shape of language to speak them — a process called \" thinking for speaking \" . This interpretation is supported by Whorf 's subsequent statement that \" No individual is free to describe nature with absolute impartiality , but is constrained by certain modes of interpretation even when he thinks himself most free \" . Similarly the statement that observers are led to different pictures of the universe has been understood as an argument that different conceptualizations are incommensurable making translation between different conceptual and linguistic systems impossible .

  "The graptolites are colonial organic walled fossils which also occurred from the Ordovician to the Devonian ; only part of their life cycle is known and it is not clear how they reproduced . It has been suggested that the Chitinozoa may represent the pre @-@ sicula stages of graptolites - the period between the colony 's sexual reproduction , and the formation of a new colony . This hypothesis appears to be supported by the co @-@ occurrence of graptolite and chitinozoan fossils , whose abundances appear to mirror one another . The similar chemical composition of the fossils has been seized by both sides of the argument . Proponents suggest that the use of the same chemical framework is an indicator that the two may be related . However , this factor means that situations favouring the preservation of one will also tend to preserve the other - and the preparation techniques used to extract the fossils will also favour or disfavour the two groups equally . Therefore , the apparent co @-@ occurrence of the two fossils may merely be an artifact of their similar composition . The hypothesis struggles to explain the continuing abundance of chitinozoans after the middle Devonian , when graptolites became increasingly rare .",

  "The album that resulted is what many call the outlaw movement 's first true record and Jennings ' artistic zenith . Almost all of the songs on Honky Tonk Heroes contain a defiant , restless longing for and celebration of the road ( \" Moving is the closest thing to being free ... \" ) and a rock and roll swagger that was entirely new in Nashville circles . Although concept albums were not new in country music , with stars like Johnny Cash , Marty Robbins , and Porter Wagoner all having recorded LPs with unifying themes , Honky Tonk Heroes offered a more progressive take on the enterprise , resembling the albums Mickey Newbury had recently recorded and the blockbuster Red Headed Stranger album that Willie Nelson would release two years later . In addition to Shaver 's brooding compositions , Jennings rounded out the collection with the tender ballad \" We Had It All , \" written by Kris Kristofferson keyboardist \" Funky \" Donnie Fritts . According to Michael Striessguth 's book Outlaw , RCA had asked Waylon to tack on one more song to augment the Shaver songs , in hopes of landing a hit single , and after considering Steve Young 's \" Seven Bridges Road , \" Jimmie Rodgers ' \" T for Texas , \" and Shel Silverstein 's \" The Leaving Coming On , \" Jennings opted for the Fritts tune , which would go on to be recorded and performed by Rod Stewart , Ray Charles , Bob Dylan , the Rolling Stones . Released as a single , \" We Had it All \" , peaked at number 28 in Billboard 's Country Singles . Jennings and Shaver also collaborated on the hit single \" You Asked Me To , \" which spent fifteen weeks on the Billboard country singles charts , reaching a peak of number eight . In the liner notes to The Essential Waylon Jennings , Wade Jessen quotes the singer : \" We wrote this one night in the dark over at Bobby Bare 's office across the street from a Burger Boy where we 'd been playing pinball . Shaver said , ' I 've got it started . Let 's finish it . ' We wrote it pretty well in the dark . \" Shaver recorded his own version in 1977 for the album Gypsy Boy , with special guest Willie Nelson on guitar and vocals . \" You Asked Me To \" also appeared as the closing song on Elvis Presley 's 1975 album Promised Land .",
  "The game was in development by Headfirst Productions for at least six years , and the development can be traced back to August 1999 and a discussion on the Usenet group alt.horror.cthulhu in which the Mythos fans contributed ideas for the game to Headfirst 's Andrew Brazier . This and other feedback was later used to create the game , which Brazier termed \" FPHAS - a First Person Horror Adventure Shooter \" . The game 's protagonist Jack Walters has been repeatedly redesigned before his final look was created by Tim Appleton .

  "The placement of the coin on the mouth can be compared to practices pertaining to the disposition of the dead in the Near East .

  "After King Francis I commissioned Jacques Cartier to search out an eastern route to Asia , the city of Port Royal was founded on 27 July 1605 in what is today Nova Scotia . From there , the French Crown 's empire in the Americas grew to include areas of land surrounding the Great Lakes and down the Mississippi River , as well as islands in the Caribbean , and the north eastern shore of South America ; the Viceroyalty of New France was eventually made into a royal province of France in 1663 by King Louis XIV . Some regions were lost to the Spanish or British Crowns through conflict and treaties , and those that were still possessions of the French king on 21 December 1792 came under republican rule when the French monarchy was abolished on that day . Upon several restorations of the monarchy , the royal presence in the Americas ended with the collapse of the Second French Empire under Napoleon III in 1870 .",

  "The American zoologist Austin Hobart Clark gave the Lesser Antillean macaw its scientific name , Ara guadeloupensis , in 1905 , based on the contemporary accounts , and he also cited a 1765 color plate as possibly depicting this species . He wrote that it was different in several ways from the superficially similar scarlet macaw ( A. macao ) , as well as the green @-@ winged macaw ( A. chloropterus ) and the Cuban macaw ( A. tricolor ) . Clark suggested the species might have existed on the islands of Dominica and Martinique , based on accounts of red macaws there , as well as on Guadeloupe . In his 1907 book Extinct Birds , the British zoologist Walter Rothschild instead claimed each island had its own species , and that the Lesser Antillean macaw was confined to Guadeloupe . In 1967 , the American ornithologist James Greenway wrote that the macaws reported from Guadeloupe could have been imported to the region from elsewhere by the native population , but this is difficult to prove . Greenway also suggested that the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the Lesser Antillean macaw and other hypothetical extinct species suggested for Jamaica and Hispaniola . According to the English paleontologist Julian Hume , the similarity between the Lesser Antillean macaw and the scarlet macaw indicates that they were close relatives , and that the Guadeloupe species may have descended from the mainland macaw .",

  "The GNER had authority for a railway from York to Newcastle ; it opened to Darlington in 1841 having spent all of its authorised capital and could not start work on the extension to Newcastle .

  "Sheep are flock animals and strongly gregarious ; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies . The dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species . Furthermore , in contrast to the red deer and gazelle ( two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times ) , sheep do not defend territories although they do form home ranges . All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock , although this behavior varies with breed , and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members . During flocking , sheep have a strong tendency to follow and a leader may simply be the first individual to move . Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep : in mixed @-@ breed flocks , subgroups of the same breed tend to form , and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks .

  "Mathematicians often strive for a complete classification ( or list ) of a mathematical notion . In the context of finite groups , this aim leads to difficult mathematics . According to Lagrange 's theorem , finite groups of order p , a prime number , are necessarily cyclic ( abelian ) groups Zp . Groups of order p2 can also be shown to be abelian , a statement which does not generalize to order p3 , as the non @-@ abelian group D4 of order 8 = 23 above shows . Computer algebra systems can be used to list small groups , but there is no classification of all finite groups . An intermediate step is the classification of finite simple groups . A nontrivial group is called simple if its only normal subgroups are the trivial group and the group itself . The Jordan – Hölder theorem exhibits finite simple groups as the building blocks for all finite groups . Listing all finite simple groups was a major achievement in contemporary group theory . 1998 Fields Medal winner Richard Borcherds succeeded in proving the monstrous moonshine conjectures , a surprising and deep relation between the largest finite simple sporadic group — the \" monster group \" — and certain modular functions , a piece of classical complex analysis , and string theory , a theory supposed to unify the description of many physical phenomena .",

He authorised troop withdrawal from the Papal States in July , but by January 1832 they were back to put down a second rebellion . By now Metternich was ageing noticeably : his hair was grey and his face drawn and sunken , although his wife still enjoyed his company . In February 1832 a daughter , also Melanie , was born ; in 1833 a son , Klemens , though he died aged two months ; in October 1834 a second son , Paul ; and in 1837 his third with Melanie , Lothar .

  "During the rediscovery of Mendelian inheritance at the turn of the 20th century , HD was used tentatively as an example of autosomal dominant inheritance . The English biologist William Bateson used the pedigrees of affected families to establish that HD had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern . The strong inheritance pattern prompted several researchers , including Smith Ely Jelliffe , to attempt to trace and connect family members of previous studies . Jelliffe collected information from across New York and published several articles regarding the genealogy of HD in New England . Jelliffe 's research roused the interest of his college friend , Charles Davenport , who commissioned Elizabeth Muncey to produce the first field study on the East Coast of the United States of families with HD and to construct their pedigrees . Davenport used this information to document the variable age of onset and range of symptoms of HD ; he claimed that most cases of HD in the USA could be traced back to a handful of individuals . This research was further embellished in 1932 by P. R. Vessie , who popularized the idea that three brothers who left England in 1630 bound for Boston were the progenitors of HD in the USA . The claim that the earliest progenitors had been established and eugenic bias of Muncey 's , Davenport 's , and Vessie 's work contributed to misunderstandings and prejudice about HD . Muncey and Davenport also popularized the idea that in the past some HD sufferers may have been thought to be possessed by spirits or victims of witchcraft , and were sometimes shunned or exiled by society . This idea has not been proven . Researchers have found contrary evidence ; for instance , the community of the family studied by George Huntington openly accommodated those who exhibited symptoms of HD .",

  "Quwatli 's early involvement in the Arab nationalist movement came through the Arab Congress of 1913 . Shortly after starting his career at the Ottoman civil service in Damascus , he received an invitation to attend the conference in Paris . However , the conference was strongly condemned by the Ottoman authorities , and Arab notables were forbidden from attending . Nevertheless , the congress had succeeded in rousing nationalist feelings in Arab provinces . Quwatli 's first confrontation with the Ottoman authorities came in February 1914 during a visit by Jamal Pasha , the governor of Syria at the time , to the offices of the Governorate of Damascus , where Quwatli worked . During the visit , Quwatli refused to follow the normal protocol — bending over and kissing Jamal Pasha 's right hand — and was promptly thrown in prison at the Citadel of Damascus . He was bailed out of prison a few days later through his family 's connections , but he lost his job at the civil service .",
  "Despite having established themselves as a group , Morrissey and Marr still harboured ambitions that they would be recognised as songwriters by having their songs covered by others . Their top choice was singer Sandie Shaw , who had scored several hits throughout the 1960s and was one of the most prominent British vocalists of her era . In the summer of 1983 , Marr and Morrissey began asking Shaw to cover their song \" I Don 't Owe You Anything \" , which they had conceived with her in mind to perform . The pair sent Shaw various letters coupled with song demos . Shaw was sceptical at first ; she was discouraged by the negative media attention that accompanied the Smiths song \" Reel Around the Fountain \" , and when she received a copy of \" Hand in Glove \" in the mail , she reportedly exclaimed to her husband \" he 's started sending me pictures of naked men with their bums showing ! \"",

  "On the evening of September 16 , McClellan ordered Hooker 's I Corps to cross Antietam Creek and probe the enemy positions . Meade 's division cautiously attacked Hood 's troops near the East Woods . After darkness fell , artillery fire continued as McClellan positioned his troops for the next day 's fighting . McClellan 's plan was to overwhelm the enemy 's left flank . He arrived at this decision because of the configuration of bridges over the Antietam . The lower bridge ( which would soon be named Burnside Bridge ) was dominated by Confederate positions on the bluffs overlooking it . The middle bridge , on the road from Boonsboro , was subject to artillery fire from the heights near Sharpsburg . But the upper bridge was 2 miles ( 3 km ) east of the Confederate guns and could be crossed safely . McClellan planned to commit more than half his army to the assault , starting with two corps , supported by a third , and if necessary a fourth . He intended to launch a simultaneous diversionary attack against the Confederate right with a fifth corps , and he was prepared to strike the center with his reserves if either attack succeeded . The skirmish in the East Woods served to signal McClellan 's intentions to Lee , who prepared his defenses accordingly . He shifted men to his left flank and sent urgent messages to his two commanders who had not yet arrived on the battlefield : Lafayette McLaws with two divisions and A.P. Hill with one division .",

  "The most extensive study of the characteristics of altered states of consciousness was made by psychologist Charles Tart in the 1960s and 1970s .

Alternatively it may be that these settlements had already been retaken by the Welsh , implying a defensive role for the barrier .

  "Since the Middle Ages , both the Stjørdalen and Verdal valleys were important trade routes connecting Trøndelag and Jämtland . In particular , Levanger grew into an important trading town for Jämtland farmers , who would travel across the Verdal Mountains . The first public discussion of a railway was launched in Levanger in 1858 ; the initiative was pushed by Jämtland 's governor Thome , who proposed a line via Verdal to Levanger . At the time , the Trondhjem – Støren Line was about to be built , and the commercial interests in Trondheim were more concerned with a southward connection along what would become the Røros Line to Oslo .

  "Ale primarily destroy crops in fields , vineyards , and orchards by leading hail storm clouds overhead , usually during the first half of the summer when grain crops ripen . Ale are also believed to “ drink the crops ” , or seize the crops of a village and transport them to another place in their huge ears , thereby making some villages poor , and others rich . This was held as the reason why the Aleksandrovac region in central Serbia was so fruitful : it was where ale transported their loot . The people of Kopaonik mountain believed the local ala defended the crops of the area from other ale . If hail destroyed the crops , it was thought that an ala from another area had defeated the local ala and “ drunk the crops ” . Ale can also spread themselves over fields and thwart the ripening of the crops , or worse , consume the field 's fertility , and drink the milk from sheep , especially when it thunders . Ale also possess great strength ; when a storm uprooted trees , the people believed that an ala had done it . This resulted in a saying for a very strong man : jak kao ala , \" as strong as an ala \" .",

  "Lutetium has no biological role as well , but it is found even in the highest known organism , the humans , concentrating in bones , and to a lesser extent in the liver and kidneys . Lutetium salts are known to cause metabolism and they occur together with other lanthanide salts in nature ; the element is the least abundant in the human body of all lanthanides . Human diets have not been monitored for lutetium content , so it is not known how much the average human takes in , but estimations show the amount is only about several micrograms per year , all coming from tiny amounts taken by plants . Soluble lutetium salts are mildly toxic , but insoluble ones are not .",
  "In planning its new offensive , the North Korean command decided any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy . Instead , they opted to use a frontal attack to breach the perimeter and collapse it as the only hope of achieving success in the battle .

The first known use of this word was in 1539 .

Lang felt that he would be too old to lead it and that he should make way for a younger man , preferably William Temple . On 27 November he informed the prime minister , Winston Churchill , of his decision to retire on 31 March 1942 . His last official act in office , on 28 March , was the confirmation of Princess Elizabeth .",

  "While no evidence indicates Diplodocus nesting habits , other sauropods , such as the titanosaurian Saltasaurus , have been associated with nesting sites . The titanosaurian nesting sites indicate that they may have laid their eggs communally over a large area in many shallow pits , each covered with vegetation . Diplodocus may have done the same . The documentary Walking with Dinosaurs portrayed a mother Diplodocus using an ovipositor to lay eggs , but it was pure speculation on the part of the documentary author . For Diplodocus and other sauropods , the size of clutches and individual eggs were surprisingly small for such large animals . This appears to have been an adaptation to predation pressures , as large eggs would require greater incubation time and thus would be at greater risk .",

  "The current Theatre Royal on Drury Lane is the most recent of four incarnations , the first of which opened in 1663 , making it the oldest continuously used theatre in London . For much of its first two centuries , it was , along with the Royal Opera House , a patent theatre granted rights in London for the production of drama , and had a claim to be one of London 's leading theatres . The first theatre , known as \" Theatre Royal , Bridges Street \" , saw performances by Nell Gwyn and Charles Hart . After it was destroyed by fire in 1672 , English dramatist and theatre manager Thomas Killigrew constructed a larger theatre on the same spot , which opened in 1674 . The design is believed to have involved Christopher Wren , who may also have been involved in the similar Dorset Garden Theatre , though it is not certain Wren was involved in either building . Killigrew 's theatre lasted nearly 120 years , under leadership including Colley Cibber , David Garrick , and Richard Brinsley Sheridan . In 1791 , under Sheridan 's management , the building was demolished to make way for a larger theatre which opened in 1794 ; but that survived only 15 years , burning down in 1809 . The building that stands today opened in 1812 . It has been home to actors as diverse as Shakespearean actor Edmund Kean , child actress Clara Fisher , comedian Dan Leno , the comedy troupe Monty Python ( who recorded a concert album there ) , and musical composer and performer Ivor Novello .

  "In Jainism , the understanding and implementation of Ahimsā is more radical , scrupulous , and comprehensive than in any other religion . Killing any living being out of passions is considered hiṃsā ( to injure ) and abstaining from such an act is ahimsā ( noninjury ) .

  "The Housing Trust was a key plank in Playford 's campaign to keep costs low and promote investment . By providing cheap housing , workers could also be persuaded to accept lower salaries , therefore keeping production costs down . In 1940 , Playford introduced the Housing Improvement Act to parliament , having seen the benefits of the Housing Trust 's activities . The main aims of the legislation were \" to improve the adverse housing conditions \" by replacing \" insanitary , old , crowded , or obsolete dwelling houses \" with better @-@ quality buildings — at the time many older residences in the city centre were made of corrugated iron and many areas were slum @-@ like . The law forced landlords to provide a minimum standard of housing and enacted rent controls , setting a maximum rent for various houses ; at the time many landlords bought large numbers of low @-@ quality dwellings and charged tenants exorbitant prices . It also expanded the role of the Housing Trust , potentially undercutting the rentier class . Labor were taken aback by Playford 's move , as this was the start of a trend whereby the nominally conservative government pursued policies that were more left @-@ wing than other Labor governments across the country . After expressing shock at Playford 's \" loving kindness to the poor and distressed \" , Labor helped to get the legislation — which threatened the interests of the landlord class that traditionally supported the LCL — passed into law . During one 15 @-@ year period , Housing Trust rents were not increased once despite steady inflation .",

  "More trouble with the legislature struck Greenfield in August 1922 , during a special session called for the purpose of passing enabling legislation for a provincial wheat board . The session lasted only a week , and on August 31 the only item of business that remained was the members ' pay for the session . The government was proposing $ 100 per member , but some MLAs complained that this was insufficient in light of the long travel times between Edmonton and their constituencies . Greenfield , lacking the counsel of the vacationing Brownlee and wanting to avoid trouble , proposed upping the amount to $ 200 . Independent MLA Robert Pearson proposed increasing it once again , to $ 250 , to match what their counterparts in Saskatchewan had received . This suggestion was carried . While Greenfield had hardly been the driving force behind the increases , he had facilitated them and had been blind to the appearance of paying MLAs more for six afternoons of work than some farmers were able to earn in a year . The grassroots of his own party condemned the move , all the more so when the wheat board that had been the purpose of the special session failed to come to fruition .",

The often colorful race descriptions soon captured young Smith 's attention and he wrote down and stockpiled the names and times of the winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts . In the fall of 1879 , Smith placed his first bet on a 5 : 1 odds horse named Gabriel running in a race at the Brighton Beach racetrack at Coney Island . He won $ 38 when the horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while the race was run . Determined that he could win at horse racing , Smith quit his job at the cork factory and accrued more than $ 5 @,@ 000 from betting on horse races in the next two years , hiding the proceeds under his mattress at home . Upon his mother eventually discovering the money , he reasoned with her that he was not really gambling because he was making logical predictions based on the past performances of horses and not merely guessing .

However , Smith was becoming too famous in Pittsburgh . He could not maintain the favorable , high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown because everyone in the crowd would lower the odds by betting his choices .",

  "In the Early Middle Ages beer was primarily brewed in monasteries , and on a smaller scale in individual households . By the High Middle Ages breweries in the fledgling medieval towns of northern Germany began to take over production . Though most of the breweries were small family businesses that employed at most eight to ten people , regular production allowed for investment in better equipment and increased experimentation with new recipes and brewing techniques . These operations later spread to the Netherlands in the 14th century , then to Flanders and Brabant , and reached England by the 15th century . Hopped beer became very popular in the last decades of the Late Middle Ages . In England and the Low Countries , the per capita annual consumption was around 275 to 300 litres ( 60 to 66 imp gal ; 73 to 79 US gal ) , and it was consumed with practically every meal : low alcohol @-@ content beers for breakfast , and stronger ones later in the day . When perfected as an ingredient , hops could make beer keep for six months or more , and facilitated extensive exports . In Late Medieval England , the word beer came to mean a hopped beverage , whereas ale had to be unhopped . In turn , ale or beer was classified into \" strong \" and \" small \" , the latter less intoxicating , regarded as a drink of temperate people , and suitable for consumption by children . As late as 1693 , John Locke stated that the only drink he considered suitable for children of all ages was small beer , while criticizing the apparently common practice among Englishmen of the time to give their children wine and strong alcohol .",

  "The appearance of Howard 's Conan and Hyboria in the popular imagination owes much to Frazetta 's distinctive oil paintings . While Nihilistic 's writers tried to tell a story in Howard 's style , its artists attempted to emulate Frazetta 's style on the electronic display screen . Instead of making each computer representation as realistic as possible , they created models based mainly on their perception of each object 's intrinsic nature . The artists used video graphics technology such as normal mapping technique to emulate brush strokes on the models ' textures . These digital brush strokes were visible on the cliffs in the game . The character models were outlined with light colors instead of dark ones , creating the subtle blend of object and background found in oil paintings , and fog effects allowed the team to recreate Frazetta 's use of shadows in the middle area of the image . To complete the game 's appearance , the artists used darker color palettes , motifs , and themes to present a more serious mood , in harmony with the gore and nudity in the game .",

  "Bede states that Cædwalla was a \" daring young man of the royal house of the Gewissæ \" , and gives his age at his death in 689 as about thirty , making the year of his birth about 659 . \" Gewisse \" , a tribal name , is used by Bede as an equivalent to \" West Saxon \" : the West Saxon genealogies trace back to one \" Gewis \" , an invented eponymous ancestor . According to the Chronicle , Cædwalla was the son of Coenberht , and was descended via Ceawlin from Cerdic , who was the first of the Gewisse to land in England .

The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired to paint for the Exhibition , the other being the Vršac triptych , which was commissioned by the Vršac city council . In the eyes of the clergy , Migration of the Serbs would help legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self @-@ administration in Austria @-@ Hungary . The official Church narrative held that Leopold had requested that the Serbs of Kosovo , Macedonia and the Sandžak settle the Ottoman – Habsburg frontier to create a buffer against further Ottoman encroachment , and Church officials intended for Jovanović 's painting to reflect this view .

Habsburg Serbs asserted that the agreement between Arsenije and Leopold legitimized their claim to the lands they inhabited , while Croatian nationalists decried the Serbs as \" uninvited guests \" who only acquired Leopold 's pledge of autonomy after they had migrated to the Habsburg lands . Migration of the Serbs was thus intended to challenge the historical and political narratives being forwarded by the Croatian and Hungarian painters whose works were also going to be displayed .",

  "The blacktip shark is an extremely fast , energetic predator that is usually found in groups of varying size . Segregation by sex and age does not occur ; adult males and nonpregnant females are found apart from pregnant females , and both are separated from juveniles . In Terra Ceia Bay , Florida , a nursery area for this species , juvenile blacktips form aggregations during the day and disperse at night . They aggregate most strongly in the early summer when the sharks are youngest , suggesting that they are seeking refuge from predators ( mostly larger sharks ) in numbers . Predator avoidance may also be the reason why juvenile blacktips do not congregate in the areas of highest prey density in the bay . Adults have no known predators . Known parasites of the blacktip shark include the copepods Pandarus sinuatus and P. smithii , and the monogeneans Dermophthirius penneri and Dionchus spp . , which attach the shark 's skin . This species is also parasitized by nematodes in the family Philometridae , which infest the ovaries .",

  "Panait Cerna 's lifetime success and literary fame made him the target of adulation among his fellow traditionalists , a camp which united various Junimea affiliates and Sămănătorul contributors . According to Călinescu , this group saw him as Romania 's answer to Schiller and Percy Bysshe Shelley . Junimea saw in him one of its most important members of the early 20th century , while several historians note that he was so only because , at that stage , the literary society was declining . Mehedinţi 's 1914 account of the Junimist promotion of the \" original manifestations of Romanian culture \" listed Cerna alongside Alexandru G. Florescu and other minor writers . Literary historian Z. Ornea argues that this evidenced not just a decline in standards , but also Mehedinţi 's \" tastelessness \" . Also according to Ornea , the association with Dragomirescu was also characteristic for the Junimist twilight , given that this circle had failed to impose \" a new literary direction \" , and was tributary to the legacy of various traditionalist groups .

Environmental attacks are performed by dragging enemies to certain objects , which Shen uses to eliminate opponents . Melee weapons such as knives and tyre irons are available , but they break with extended use . Players can perform \" action hijacks \" while driving vehicles .

  "London suffered severely from Viking attacks and was several times occupied by Viking armies . In 886 Alfred took possession of London , and according to Asser he \" restored \" the city and \" made it habitable again \" . He then handed control to Æthelred . Historians , however , disagree about the circumstances . According to Frank Stenton , Alfred recovered London by force from the Vikings and handed it to Æthelred because it had previously been a Mercian town , and he respected the traditions of other kingdoms . Marios Costambeys takes a similar view , arguing that Alfred 's decision was probably due to the need to maintain unity among the English who were outside Viking territory . Alfred Smyth suggests that the Chronicle 's account reflects bias in Alfred 's favour , and that Æthelred took charge because he had a greater role in London 's recovery than the West Saxon chronicler was willing to admit . Some versions of the Chronicle state that Alfred besieged London in 883 , and Simon Keynes argues that Alfred probably took London at that time and that the \" occupation \" in 886 may have been a restoration of London 's defences following Viking attacks close to the city in 885 .",

  "Botany ( Greek Βοτάνη - grass , fodder ; Medieval Latin botanicus – herb , plant ) and zoology are , historically , the core disciplines of biology whose history is closely associated with the natural sciences chemistry , physics and geology . A distinction can be made between botanical science in a pure sense , as the study of plants themselves , and botany as applied science , which studies the human use of plants . Early natural history divided pure botany into three main streams morphology @-@ classification , anatomy and physiology – that is , external form , internal structure , and functional operation . The most obvious topics in applied botany are horticulture , forestry and agriculture although there are many others like weed science , plant pathology , floristry , pharmacognosy , economic botany and ethnobotany which lie outside modern courses in botany . Since the origin of botanical science there has been a progressive increase in the scope of the subject as technology has opened up new techniques and areas of study . Modern molecular systematics , for example , entails the principles and techniques of taxonomy , molecular biology , computer science and more .",
  "The episode contains a scene in which the survivors pull a bloated walker out of a well in order to prevent contamination of the water .

Greg Nicotero , the special effects director for The Walking Dead , collaborated with KNB Efx Group to produce the sequence . Nicotero received a phone call from staff members of the company two hours after leaving production offices . They devised and expressed plans of creating a scenario in which a walker falls into a well . Nicotero worked with KNB Efx Group in several other films in the past . \" One of the things we 've noticed — looking at some morgue research and cadaver research — is that everything gets really swollen , \" he articulated . \" The liquid saturates the skin so much that it swells up , and the skin starts to split .

He explained that as the performer begins to move , the liquid transfers from one side of the costume to another . Nicotero added : \" If we made it out of foam latex , it would 've been stiff . But we used silicone that was heavily plasticized — which means that the silicone was really soft . \" The suit weighed approximately sixty pounds .",

  "SST was one of the first oceanographic variables to be measured . Benjamin Franklin suspended a mercury thermometer from a ship while travelling between the United States and Europe in his survey of the Gulf stream in the late eighteenth century . SST was later measured by dipping a thermometer into a bucket of water that was manually drawn from the sea surface . The first automated technique for determining SST was accomplished by measuring the temperature of water in the intake port of large ships , which was underway by 1963 . These observations have a warm bias of around 0 @.@ 6 ° C ( 1 ° F ) due to the heat of the engine room . This bias has led to changes in the perception of global warming since 2000 . Fixed weather buoys measure the water temperature at a depth of 3 metres ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) . Measurements of SST have had inconsistencies over the last 130 years due to the way they were taken . In the nineteenth century , measurements were taken in a bucket off of a ship . However , there was a slight variation in temperature because of the differences in buckets . Samples were collected in either a wood or an uninsulated canvas bucket , but the canvas bucket cooled quicker than the wood bucket . The sudden change in temperature between 1940 and 1941 was the result of an undocumented change in procedure . The samples were taken near the engine intake because it was too dangerous to use lights to take measurements over the side of the ship at night . Many different drifting buoys exist around the world that vary in design , and the location of reliable temperature sensors varies . These measurements are beamed to satellites for automated and immediate data distribution . A large network of coastal buoys in U.S. waters is maintained by the National Data Buoy Center ( NDBC ) . Between 1985 and 1994 , an extensive array of moored and drifting buoys was deployed across the equatorial Pacific Ocean designed to help monitor and predict the El Niño phenomenon .",

  "Spedding and Wilhelm began looking for ways to create the uranium metal . At the time , it was produced in the form of a powder , and was highly pyrophoric . It could be pressed and sintered and stored in cans , but to be useful , it needed to be melted and cast . Casting presented difficulty because uranium corroded crucibles of beryllium , magnesia and graphite . To produce uranium metal , they tried reducing uranium oxide with hydrogen , but this did not work . While most of the neighboring elements on the periodic table can be reduced to form pure metal and slag , uranium did not behave this way . In June 1942 they then tried reducing the uranium with carbon in a hydrogen atmosphere , with only moderate success . They then tried aluminum , magnesium and calcium , all of which were unsuccessful . The following month the Ames team found that molten uranium could be cast in a graphite container . Although graphite was known to react with uranium , this could be managed because the carbide formed only where the two touched .",

  "Planets also have varying degrees of axial tilt ; they lie at an angle to the plane of their stars ' equators . This causes the amount of light received by each hemisphere to vary over the course of its year ; when the northern hemisphere points away from its star , the southern hemisphere points towards it , and vice versa . Each planet therefore has seasons , changes to the climate over the course of its year . The time at which each hemisphere points farthest or nearest from its star is known as its solstice . Each planet has two in the course of its orbit ; when one hemisphere has its summer solstice , when its day is longest , the other has its winter solstice , when its day is shortest . The varying amount of light and heat received by each hemisphere creates annual changes in weather patterns for each half of the planet . Jupiter 's axial tilt is very small , so its seasonal variation is minimal ; Uranus , on the other hand , has an axial tilt so extreme it is virtually on its side , which means that its hemispheres are either perpetually in sunlight or perpetually in darkness around the time of its solstices . Among extrasolar planets , axial tilts are not known for certain , though most hot Jupiters are believed to have negligible to no axial tilt as a result of their proximity to their stars .",

  "Fortunately for Metternich the Tsar 's dual proposal for the St Petersburg meetings , a settlement of the Eastern Question favourable to Russia and limited autonomy for three Greek principalities , was a pairing unpalatable to the other European powers , and potential attendees like British Foreign Secretary George Canning slowly turned away , much to the annoyance of Alexander . Metternich believed for several months afterward that he had gained a unique level of influence over the Tsar . Meanwhile , he renewed the conservative program he had outlined at Karlsbad five years before and sought to further increase Austrian influence over the German Federal Diet . He also informed the press they could no longer publicise the minutes of Diet meetings , only its rulings . In January 1825 he began to worry about his wife Eleonore 's health and he reached her sickbed in Paris shortly before her death on 19 March . Mourning sincerely for her , he also took the opportunity to dine with the Paris elite . Unfortunately , an aside he made about the Tsar there was reported back and did not enhance his reputation . He left Paris for the last time on 21 April and was joined by the Emperor in Milan after arriving on 7 May . He declined the Pope 's invitation to become a cardinal of the church . There was also a short trip to Genoa . Early in July the court dispersed and Metternich visited his daughters Leontine ( fourteen ) and Hermine ( nine ) in the quiet town of Bad Ischl . Despite the seclusion he received constant reports , including those of ominous developments in the Ottoman Empire , where the Greek revolt was rapidly being crushed by Ibrahim Ali of Egypt .

  "Following the military coup in Spain at the start of the Spanish Civil War , the Spanish Second Republic turned to the Soviet Union and France for support , and the Nationalists requested the support of Hitler 's Germany and fascist Italy . The first attempt to secure German aviation was made on 22 July , with a request for 10 transport aircraft . Franco contacted Hitler directly .

  "On 9 April 1940 , neutral Denmark was invaded by Nazi Germany and was occupied for the rest of World War II . As Olga 's sons , Tikhon and Guri , served as officers in the Danish Army , they were interned as prisoners of war , but their imprisonment in a Copenhagen hotel lasted less than two months . Other Russian émigrés , keen to fight against the Soviets , enlisted in the German forces . Despite her sons ' internment and her mother 's Danish origins , Olga was implicated in her compatriots ' collusion with German forces , as she continued to meet and extend help to Russian émigrés fighting against communism . After the surrender of Germany in 1945 , the Soviet Union wrote to the Danish government accusing the Grand Duchess of conspiracy against the Soviet authorities .

  "There were a wide variety of other methods used to capture and kill passenger pigeons . Nets were propped up to allow passenger pigeons entry , then closed by knocking loose the stick that supported the opening , trapping twenty or more pigeons inside . Tunnel nets were also used to great effect , and one particularly large net was capable of catching 3 @,@ 500 pigeons at a time . These nets were used by many farmers on their own property as well as by professional trappers . Food would be placed on the ground near the nets to attract the pigeons . Decoy or \" Stool pigeons \" ( sometimes blinded by having their eyelids sewn together ) were tied to a stool . When a flock of pigeons passed by , a chord would be pulled that made the stool pigeon flutter to the ground , making it seem as if it had found food , and the flock would be lured into the trap . Salt was also frequently used as bait , and many trappers set up near salt springs . At least one trapper used alcohol @-@ soaked grain as bait to intoxicate the birds and make them easier to kill . Another method of capture was to hunt at a nesting colony , particularly during the period of a few days after the adult pigeons abandoned their nestlings , but before the nestlings could fly . Some hunters used sticks to poke the nestlings out of the nest , while others shot the bottom of a nest with a blunt arrow to dislodge the pigeon . Others cut down a nesting tree in such a way that when it fell , it would also hit a second nesting tree and dislodge the pigeons within . In one case , 6 km2 ( 1 @,@ 500 acres ) of large trees were speedily cut down to get birds , and such methods were common . An extreme method , practiced only by particularly unscrupulous hunters , was to set fire to the base of a tree nested with pigeons ; the adults would flee and the juveniles would fall to the ground . Sulfur was sometimes burned beneath the nesting tree to suffocate the birds , which fell out of the tree in a weakened state .",

Several attempted invasions of Canada were fiascos , but the U.S. in 1813 did seize control of Lake Erie and brake the power of hostile Indians in battles such as the Battle of the Thames in Canada in 1813 and the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in Alabama in 1814 .",

  "In 1659 , Robert Boyle commissioned the construction of an air pump , then described as a \" pneumatic engine \" , which is known today as a vacuum pump . The air pump was invented by Otto von Guericke in 1650 , though its cost deterred most contemporary scientists from constructing the apparatus . Boyle , the son of the Earl of Cork , had no such concerns — after its construction , he donated the initial 1659 model to the Royal Society and had a further two redesigned machines built for his personal use . Aside from Boyle 's three pumps , there were probably no more than four others in existence during the 1660s : Christian Huygens had one in The Hague , Henry Power may have had one at Halifax , and there may have been pumps at Christ 's College , Cambridge and the Montmor Academy in Paris . Boyle 's pump , which was largely designed to Boyle 's specifications and constructed by Robert Hooke , was complicated , temperamental , and problematic to operate . Many demonstrations could only be performed with Hooke on hand , and Boyle frequently left critical public displays solely to Hooke — whose dramatic flair matched his technical skill .",

It is written in the key of C minor , and Bieber 's vocals do not deviate far , only spanning from the low note of C4 to the high note of E5 . It features the chord patterns Cm11 and Fm9 . The song 's lyrics see the protagonist professing to their love interest how they have matured , in lines such as \" I was a player when I was little , but I 'm bigger . \" Lyrically , the song also speaks of rebuffing anyone that comes in between his reaching goals , in lines like \" And all the haters I swear they look so small from up here ... \"",

  "A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on October 19 . Moving westward , it developed a weak circulation on October 23 . Despite the presence of strong shear , the system was upgraded to a tropical depression at 2200 UTC on October 24 about 1100 miles ( 1775 km ) east of the Lesser Antilles . This was based on a rating of 1 @.@ 5 on the Dvorak technique , which is a method of estimating the intensity of tropical cyclones via satellite . At the time of development , the depression had a small area of convection near and east of the center , and due to the wind shear it was never expected to intensify . By October 25 , the circulation had become dissociated from the convection . The depression dissipated soon after without affecting land .",

  "However , events in the Italian Wars helped bring the Swabian War to an end . The French king Louis XII tried to bring the Duchy of Milan under his control . As long as the Swabian War continued , the Milanese ruler Ludovico il Moro — whose niece Bianca Maximilian had married in 1493 — could not expect help from either Swiss mercenaries or Maximilian , and thus his envoy Galeazzo Visconti tried to mediate between the Swiss and the king .

The Milanese delegation prevailed in these intrigations and succeeded to persuade both sides to moderate their demands . Finally , a peace treaty between Maximilian I and the Swiss was signed in Basel on September 22 , 1499 .

  "Rhys appears in all three Torchwood novels in the first wave published by BBC Books in January 2007 , set between episodes of Torchwood series one . These novels expand on the difficult period in Gwen and Rhys ' relationship — whilst his appearances in Another Life , and Border Princes , are relatively minor , he has a more significant role in Slow Decay , where he unwittingly brings himself into danger by taking an alien diet pill . Reviewer Patrick Holm feels that the success of these novels lies in the fact that they help readers empathise with characters such as Rhys . Rhys makes cameo appearances in Something in the Water ( set between \" Kiss Kiss Bang Bang \" and \" Meat \" ) and Trace Memory , and has a significant role in The Twilight Streets , ( released March 2008 ) which depicts an alternate future where Gwen and Rhys start a new Torchwood to make a safe world for their son after the Torchwood Team are destroyed fighting sentient particles known as the dark . Three more Torchwood books were released in October 2008 in which Rhys has an involved role . In Pack Animals Rhys assists Gwen in her investigation and becomes part of a car chase , SkyPoint sees them inadvertently discover an alien presence whilst flathunting and Almost Perfect , the first novel set after \" Exit Wounds \" , depicts Rhys speed dating undercover .

  "When sons of an epikleros came of age , they gained the ownership of the inheritance . In Athens , this age was given in an extant law , and was two years past the age of puberty of the son . In Solon 's laws , it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather , with any further sons being considered part of their father 's household . The son 's inheritance of his maternal grandfather 's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive , unlike most other inheritances . And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father , and was named after his grandfather . The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather , but this was not required . By the 4th century BCE , legal practices had changed , and the son could also inherit from his father , as well as from his maternal grandfather . And if there was more than one son , they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves . After the heir secured possession of his inheritance , the law specified that he was to support his mother . It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property .",

  "The present shape of the walls was defined in the 14th century after the city gained its full independence from Venetian suzerainty , but the peak of its construction lasted from the beginning of the 15th century until the latter half of the 16th century . Being constructed very solidly , the walls were generally unaffected by a strong earthquake occurring in 1667 . The largest stimulus for continued development and emergency repairs and works of the Ragusan fortresses came as a result of the danger of unexpected attack by Turkish military forces , especially after they conquered Constantinople in 1453 . The city was also under latent danger of attack by the Venetians . For centuries the people of Dubrovnik were able to preserve their city @-@ republic by skillful maneuvering between East and West . A strategic treaty with Turkey protracted Ragusa ’ s liberty and maintained the opportunity for a major trading role between the Ottoman Empire and Europe .",

  "The Yeomen of the Guard ( 1888 ) , their only joint work with a serious ending , concerns a pair of strolling players — a jester and a singing girl — who are caught up in a risky intrigue at the Tower of London during the 16th century . The dialogue , though in prose , is quasi @-@ early modern English in style , and there is no satire of British institutions . For some of the plot elements , Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy , Broken Hearts . The Times praised the libretto : \" It should ... be acknowledged that Mr. Gilbert has earnestly endeavoured to leave familiar grooves and rise to higher things . \" Although not a grand opera , the new libretto provided Sullivan with the opportunity to write his most ambitious score to date .

  "Confusion has surrounded the nomenclature and taxonomy of the species now known as Armillaria gallica , paralleling that surrounding the genus Armillaria . The type species , Armillaria mellea , was until the 1970s believed to be a pleiomorphic species with a wide distribution , variable pathogenicity , and one of the broadest host ranges known for the fungi . In 1973 , Veikko Hintikka reported a technique to distinguish between Armillaria species by growing them together as single spore isolates on petri dishes and observing changes in the morphology of the cultures . Using a similar technique , Kari Korhonen showed in 1978 that the European Armillaria mellea species complex could be separated into five reproductively isolated species , which he named \" European Biological Species \" ( EBS ) A through E. About the same time , the North American A. mellea was shown to be ten different species ( North American Biological Species , or NABS I through X ) ; NABS VII was demonstrated shortly after to be the same species as EBS E.

  "Great Britain controlled the whole island by 1815 , and unified the country administratively in 1833 with a legislative council that acted as advisor to the Governor .

He created the reformed legislative council in 1921 and its first election returned thirteen Sinhalese and three Tamils , a significant loss in representation for the Tamils when compared to the previous council based on direct appointment by the governor . Because of this , the Tamils began to develop a communal consciousness and to think of themselves as a minority community .

  "Multiple reactor sensors at the North Anna Nuclear Generating Station , located 10 mi ( 16 km ) northeast of the epicenter , detected a slight power reduction as a result of vibrations in the reactor or monitoring devices . This caused the two nuclear reactors to shut down automatically seconds before off @-@ site power was lost . The Nuclear Regulatory Commission sent additional inspectors to the Virginia plant after preliminary measurements suggested that the ground shook more than the two reactors were designed to handle . The damage was minimal and the NRC advised that further inspections should not be interpreted to mean that the plant was not safe . After a $ 21 million inspection , engineers stated that they only found cosmetic damage . On November 11 , 2011 , the NRC gave its approval for restarting the reactors .",

  "This scheme was criticized for providing unequal representation to the overseas territories ; nevertheless , throughout the end of 1808 and early 1809 , the provincial capitals elected candidates , whose names were forwarded to the capitals of the viceroyalties or captaincies general . Several important and large cities were left without direct representation in the Supreme Junta . In particular Quito and Chuquisaca , which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms , resented being subsumed in the larger \" kingdom \" of Peru . This unrest led to the establishment of juntas in these cities in 1809 , which were eventually quashed by the authorities within the year . An unsuccessful attempt at establishing a junta in New Spain was also stopped . In order to establish a more legitimate government , the Supreme Junta called for the convening of an \" extraordinary and general Cortes of the Spanish Nation . \" The election scheme for the Cortes , based on provinces and not kingdoms , was more equitable and provided more time to determine what would be considered an overseas province .",

  "Sensibility in the second half of the eighteenth century was considered both a physical and a moral phenomenon . Physicians and anatomists believed that the more sensitive people 's nerves , the more emotionally affected they would be by their surroundings . Since women were thought to have keener nerves than men , it was also believed that women were more emotional than men . The emotional excess associated with sensibility also theoretically produced an ethic of compassion : those with sensibility could easily sympathize with people in pain . Thus historians have credited the discourse of sensibility and those who promoted it with the increased humanitarian efforts , such as the movement to abolish the slave trade , of the eighteenth century . But sensibility was also thought to paralyze those who had too much of it ; they were weakened by constant vicarious suffering .",

  "Washington initiated more definitive measures to strengthen the regiment in early 1779 . At his request , Congress authorized on January 23 the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment to be reorganized into three companies , recruited to full strength , and reassigned from Fort Frederick to Fort Pitt , headquarters of the Continental Army 's Western Department .

Pursuant to Washington 's order , the enlisted men in Smith 's composite company who were attached to the 4th Maryland Regiment rejoined Rawlings ' command . In contrast , the Virginians of Long 's composite company already had been all but formally incorporated into the 11th Virginia Regiment by order of the Virginia state government in February 1777 . ( Because Long 's unit was a component of an Extra Continental regiment and therefore had no administrative connection to an individual state , the Virginia state government had exceeded its authority in this action , which was technically only within the purview of Congress . Washington tacitly accepted the arrangement , but the process was probably not formalized until the reorganization and redesignation of the 11th Virginia Regiment as the 7th Virginia Regiment on May 12 , 1779 . ) Moreover , the enlisted men of Smith 's and Long 's companies who were still attached to the Provisional Rifle Corps , which was not part of the Main Army at this time , remained in that unit until mid @-@ 1779 , at which time they left the service because their three @-@ year enlistment periods had expired .

  "The Indricotheriinae subfamily , to which Paraceratherium belongs , was first classified as part of the Hyracodontidae family by Leonard B. Radinsky in 1966 . Previously , they had been regarded as a subfamily within Rhinocerotidea , or even a full family , Indricotheriidae . In a 1999 cladistic study of tapiromorphs , Luke Holbrook found indricotheres to be outside the hyracodontid clade , and wrote that they may not be a monophyletic ( natural ) grouping . Radinsky 's scheme is the prevalent hypothesis today . The hyracodont family contains long @-@ legged members adapted to running , such as Hyracodon , and were distinguished by incisor characteristics . Indricotheres are distinguished from other hyracodonts by their larger size and the derived structure of their snouts , incisors and canines .

  "The game features 24 levels , based on eight block patterns in groups of three . After every three regular stages , the player proceeds to a bonus stage , giving the game a total of 32 levels . Most levels follow a generic design , though one group is modeled after Mario 's head as it appears next to the remaining paddles icon . The player progresses to the next level once all bricks are destroyed , where the same pattern of bricks appears but behaves differently . Every second stage is a Scrolling Block Screen , featuring bricks that move from left to right ; every third is an Advancing Block Screen , where the bricks move downward the height of one regular brick in short bursts , increasing in speed as the ball bounces off the paddle . Any part of a brick below a height of ten bricks above the paddle is automatically removed ; thus they cannot impede the player 's movement but cannot contribute towards the player 's score either .",

  "The writers initially intended that Sam would save Dean from Hell , possibly even before \" No Rest for the Wicked \" , by giving in to his demonic powers and becoming \" this fully operational dark force \" who would then want to go after Lilith . The battle would have been \" much more climactic \" , with the Winchesters \" going to war to save Dean 's life \" . By the middle of the season , however , the writers realized the costs associated with depicting such an engagement and scaled it down . To make matters worse , the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike prevented them from fleshing out Sam 's evolving abilities throughout the season , and his entire story arc was pushed back into the fourth season .

  "After the assassination in mid @-@ 1584 of William the Silent , the leader of the Dutch revolt against Spain , English military intervention in the Low Countries was agreed in the Treaties of Nonsuch of 1585 .

The Act for the Surety of the Queen 's Person , passed by Parliament in March 1585 , set up a legal process for trying any claimant to the throne implicated in plots against the Queen . The following month Mary , Queen of Scots , was placed in the strict custody of Sir Amias Paulet , a friend of Walsingham . At Christmas , she was moved to a moated manor house at Chartley . Walsingham instructed Paulet to open , read and pass to Mary unsealed any letters that she received , and to block any potential route for clandestine correspondence . In a successful attempt to entrap her , Walsingham arranged a single exception : a covert means for Mary 's letters to be smuggled in and out of Chartley in a beer keg . Mary was misled into thinking these secret letters were secure , while in reality they were deciphered and read by Walsingham 's agents . In July 1586 , Anthony Babington wrote to Mary about an impending plot to free her and kill Elizabeth . Mary 's reply was clearly encouraging and sanctioned Babington 's plans .

  "In July 1945 , the Kilgore bill was introduced in Congress , proposing the appointment and removal of a single science administrator by the president , with emphasis on applied research , and a patent clause favoring a government monopoly . In contrast , the competing Magnuson bill was similar to Bush 's proposal to vest control in a panel of top scientists and civilian administrators with the executive director appointed by them . The Magnuson bill emphasized basic research and protected private patent rights . A compromise Kilgore – Magnuson bill of February 1946 passed the Senate but expired in the House because Bush favored a competing bill that was a virtual duplicate of the original Magnuson bill . A Senate bill was introduced in February 1947 to create the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) to replace the OSRD . This bill favored most of the features advocated by Bush , including the controversial administration by an autonomous scientific board . The bill passed the Senate and the House , but was pocket vetoed by Truman on August 6 , on the grounds that the administrative officers were not properly responsible to either the president or Congress . The OSRD was abolished without a successor organization on December 31 , 1947 .",

  "The Bill of Middlesex was a legal fiction used by the Court of King 's Bench to gain jurisdiction over cases traditionally in the remit of the Court of Common Pleas . Hinging on the King 's Bench 's remaining criminal jurisdiction over the county of Middlesex , the Bill allowed it to take cases traditionally in the remit of other common law courts by claiming that the defendant had committed trespass in Middlesex . Once the defendant was in custody , the trespass complaint would be quietly dropped and other complaints ( such as debt or detinue ) would be substituted . Part of a large reform movement to prevent equitable courts such as the Court of Chancery undermining their business , the Bill was far cheaper and faster than the older equivalents used by the Chancery and Common Pleas , leading to a drop in their business and an increase in that of the King 's Bench . As such , the Chancery issued injunctions in an ineffective attempt to prevent its use . The Bill was finally abolished by the Uniformity of Process Act 1832 .",
