  "The left edge of the conveyor belt is sharp due to higher density air moving in from the west forcing a sharp slope to the cold front . An area of stratiform precipitation develops poleward of the warm front along the conveyor belt . Active precipitation poleward of the warm front implies potential for greater development of the cyclone . A portion of this conveyor belt turns to the right ( left in the Southern Hemisphere ) , aligning with the upper level westerly flow . However , the western portion of this belt wraps around the northwest ( southwest in the Southern Hemisphere ) side of the cyclone , which can contain moderate to heavy precipitation . If the air mass is cold enough , the precipitation falls in the form of heavy snow .

  "At the time of commissioning , Douglas Henshall and Daniel Craig were considered for the parts of Brown and Blair respectively , though David Morrissey and Michael Sheen were eventually announced as the leads in March 2003 . Morrissey gained two stone for his role and had his hair permed and dyed .

  "During an interview with Marion McMullen from the Coventry Evening Telegraph , Davies explained that the Gothic elements to the novel gave him inspiration to add dream sequences and fantasies to the script . He told McMullen , \" I 've been very faithful to the book , but one of the differences has been writing the scenes showing Catherine 's fantasies . Catherine is a great reader of horror fiction – the gothic novel was fairly popular in those days , like a young girl today who would read a lot of rather steamy romances . In this production , we see some of Catherine 's fantasies , some of which are quite steamy for a young girl . \" Davies admitted that he was proud of his reputation for \" sexing up \" the novels he had adapted and commented that none of his scenes were gratuitous . He told McMullen that he often looked for excuses to get the characters out of their clothes , as he felt they were always being \" buttoned up to the neck \" . Producer Keith Thompson said Davies had made Northanger Abbey a bit more erotic than the novel and thought the script had \" a wonderful cheekiness to it . \" Davies chose to use a narrator to speak Austen 's words and help set the scene at the beginning and end of the film .",

Some agitated for the government to take action against them , and at the very least the idea of extending further \" privileges \" was out of the question . A series of intrigues took place from 1640 @-@ 1650 with pro @-@ Jesuit governor Gregorio de Hinestrosa vying against the anti @-@ Jesuit Bishop Bernardino de Cárdenas , a Franciscan . Cárdenas was exiled to Corrientes , but upon the end of Hinestrosa 's governorship returned to Asunción . The new governor Diego de Escobar y Osorio attempted to remain neutral in the conflict between the Jesuits and the settlers who were now backed by the returned Cárdenas , and successfully avoided bloodshed for a time , but in 1649 Osorio died . The cabildo , seizing on the Decree of 1537 , promptly elected Cárdenas the new governor , and with his support expelled the Jesuits from their college in Asunción . They wrote in explanation of their actions that the Jesuits were destroying the province , and it was the \" natural right \" of people to defend themselves against aggression . Governor @-@ Bishop Cárdenas , in similar proto @-@ democratic language , said \" the voice of the People is the voice of God . \" The authorities were displeased , and the Jesuits , with the government 's permission , sent in an army of mission Indians to depose Cárdenas . Cárdenas and the Paraguayan militia decided to resist , and in a battle on October 5 , 1649 , the Jesuit army of roughly 700 Indians won a complete victory . The Paraguayans were scattered , Cárdenas and his closest supporters were arrested , and the citizens of Asunción were subjected to the humiliation of an occupying army of Indians patrolling their streets and enforcing the new governor 's rule . This wound never healed . By 1721 , hatred of the Jesuits was even more intense than it was in the early 1600s .",

  "Intergalactic space is the physical space between galaxies . The huge spaces between galaxy clusters are called the voids . Surrounding and stretching between galaxies , there is a rarefied plasma that is organized in a galactic filamentary structure . This material is called the intergalactic medium ( IGM ) . The density of the IGM is 5 – 200 times the average density of the Universe . It consists mostly of ionized hydrogen ; i.e. a plasma consisting of equal numbers of electrons and protons . As gas falls into the intergalactic medium from the voids , it heats up to temperatures of 105 K to 107 K , which is high enough so that collisions between atoms have enough energy to cause the bound electrons to escape from the hydrogen nuclei ; this is why the IGM is ionized . At these temperatures , it is called the warm – hot intergalactic medium ( WHIM ) . ( Although the plasma is very hot by terrestrial standards , 105 K is often called \" warm \" in astrophysics . ) Computer simulations and observations indicate that up to half of the atomic matter in the Universe might exist in this warm – hot , rarefied state .

Prior to the Oaks , Napravnik told reporters , \" I own this race . \" Napravnik 's win on Untapable and a victory in the Humana Distaff Handicap , on the undercard on Derby day , brought her ranking up to second in the nation for jockey earnings and wins during the early weeks of May 2014 . With mounts on Vicar 's In Trouble in the Derby , Bayern in the 2014 Preakness Stakes , and General a Rod in the Belmont , for the second year in a row , she rode horses in all three Triple Crown races . She was in contention for leading jockey at Churchill Downs ' spring meet , in second place with 31 winners , including a single day where she won five races , setting yet another record for a woman rider . But on June 15 , the day after she had a major win on Tapiture , she had another significant injury : a separation of her clavicle and left shoulder joint that occurred when a horse she was working in the morning broke its leg and fell . While Napravnik did not require surgery , she was sidelined for a few weeks . Even though she missed the end of the Churchill meet , she still tied for second place in leading rider standings at that track . By July 5 she was working horses . She returned to racing on July 18 for the opening day of the Saratoga meet . In October , she repeated as leading rider at Keenland 's fall meet .",

  "The art and science writer Peter Forbes notes that Thayer became obsessed by the \" flattening effect \" of countershading , and that far from being a scientist , he was \" an artist whose idealist fervour , edged by deep insecurity , led him to regard his findings less as discovery than as revelation . \" Describing Concealing @-@ Coloration as a \" magnum opus \" , Forbes writes that by 1909 \" Thayer 's prophetic intolerance was in full flood \" , that he was overcompensating for his need for approval of his artwork , and that he failed to see that acceptance of ideas in science does not depend on \" the vehemence with which they are expressed \" . In Forbes 's view , Thayer was battling for the rights of artists over scientists , citing Thayer ( \" it properly belongs to the realm of pictorial art \" ) in evidence . Apart from Thayer 's \" bizarre \" flamingos , Forbes calls Thayer 's opposition to Batesian mimicry \" extreme \" . For Forbes , \" Reading Thayer 's book today is a strange experience .

Forbes is critical of Thayer 's rejection of warning coloration , quoting Thayer 's daughter Gladys as writing \" My father 's special mission was tasting butterflies \" ; Thayer apparently wanted to prove that mimicry was the wrong explanation as both model and mimic tasted the same .

  "Haynes was likely born at Messing , Essex , England , the eldest son of John Haynes and Mary Michel Haynes . The family was an armigerous gentry or ' visitation family ' who had lived at Codicote , Herefordshire , and at Great Haddam . In 1605 , when he was eleven , his father died , and he eventually inherited the family 's many properties . It is possible that Haynes attended Cambridge ; during the relevant time period , two John Hayneses are listed as attending . By about 1616 , Haynes was living at Gurney 's Manor , Hingham , Norfolk , a hotbed of Puritan sentiment , where Haynes was Lord of the Manor . There he married Mary Thorneton , the daughter of Norfolk nobility , with whom he had six children . In 1627 , his wife Mary died and was buried at St. Andrews Church in Hingham . In the early 1620s , he purchased Copford Hall , near Colchester in Essex ; this estate alone was reported to produce £ 1 @,@ 100 per year .",
  "Sales were very good , and Ziff @-@ Davis was sufficiently impressed to move the magazine from a quarterly to a bimonthly schedule after only two issues , and to switch Amazing from pulp format to digest @-@ size to match Fantastic . Shortly afterwards the decision was taken to eliminate Fantastic Adventures : the March 1953 issue was the last , and the May – June 1953 issue of Fantastic added a mention of Fantastic Adventures to the masthead , though this disappeared with the following issue . Payment started at two cents per word for all rights , but could go up to ten cents at the editor 's discretion ; this put Fantastic in the second echelon of magazines , behind markets such as Astounding and Galaxy . The experiment with quality fiction did not last ; circulation dropped , which led to budget cuts , and in turn the quality of the fiction fell . Browne had wanted to separate Fantastic from Amazing 's pulp roots , but now found he had to print more science fiction ( sf ) and less fantasy in order to attract Amazing 's readers to its sister magazine . Fantastic 's poor results were probably a consequence of the overloaded sf magazine market ; far more magazines appeared in the early 1950s than the market was able to support . Ziff @-@ Davis sales staff were able to help sell Fantastic and Amazing along with the technical magazines that it published , and the availability of a national sales network , even though it was not focused solely on Fantastic , undoubtedly helped the magazine to survive .",

Although Bosworth 's performance was ambivalently received , she herself loved the experience of working on the movie .

  "Sources are vague , but it is likely that St. George 's Church fell into disrepair during the early decades of Islamic rule , and that unfavorable circumstances for the Christian population prevented them from rebuilding it . However , it was partially rebuilt with old materials by the Crusaders , who conquered the area in 1099 . The Crusaders built a large courtyard building in Jifna .

  "The second factor is the value of protection : would the plant be less able to survive and reproduce after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore ? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value , thus valuable parts contain more defenses . A plant ’ s stage of development at the time of feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness . Experimentally , the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect . In general , reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts , terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves , and the loss of plant parts mid @-@ season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the beginning or end of the season . Seeds in particular tend to be very well protected . For example , the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as amygdalin . This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal .",

  "Due to the nature of its legal work , the ACLU is often involved in litigation against governmental bodies , which are generally protected from adverse monetary judgments ; a town , state or federal agency may be required to change its laws or behave differently , but not to pay monetary damages except by an explicit statutory waiver . In some cases , the law permits plaintiffs who successfully sue government agencies to collect money damages or other monetary relief . In particular , the Civil Rights Attorney 's Fees Award Act of 1976 leaves the government liable in some civil rights cases .

This move shocked the European bidders , but could partly be explained by the American steel trust 's ability to produce steel at a lower cost than any other country .",

  "By the early 18th century , with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred , a number of European trading companies , including the English East India Company , had established coastal outposts . The East India Company 's control of the seas , greater resources , and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly flex its military muscle and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite ; both these factors were crucial in allowing the Company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies . Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s . India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had , but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials , and many historians consider this to be the onset of India 's colonial period . By this time , with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and itself effectively made an arm of British administration , the Company began to more consciously enter non @-@ economic arenas such as education , social reform , and culture .",

The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbian Latin : Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Croatian : Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to minimize resistance .

The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency . Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies , the JNA request was refused on 15 March . Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expanding Serbia as the JNA came under Milošević 's control . The first casualties of the conflict occurred by the end of March . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to unite the areas under their control with Serbia . These areas were viewed by the Government of Croatia as breakaway regions .",

  "Caesar held both the Dictatorship and the Plebeian Tribunate , but alternated between the Consulship and the Proconsulship . His powers within the state seem to have rested upon these magistracies . The Dictatorship of Caesar was fundamentally different from the Dictatorship of the early and middle republic , as he held the office for life , rather than for six months , and he also held certain judicial powers which the ordinary Dictators had not held . In 48 BC , Caesar was given permanent tribunician powers , which made his person sacrosanct , allowed him to veto the Roman Senate , and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council . Since Tribunes were always elected by the Plebeian Council , Caesar had hoped to prevent the election of Tribunes who might oppose him . In 46 BC , Caesar gave himself the title of \" Prefect of the Morals \" ( praefectura morum ) , which was an office that was new only in name , as its powers were identical to those of the Censors . Thus , he could hold Censorial powers , while technically not subjecting himself to the same checks that the ordinary Censors were subject to , and he used these powers to fill the senate with his own partisans . He also set the precedent , which his imperial successors followed , of requiring the senate to bestow various titles and honors upon him .

  "Trappers and explorers arrived in southern Idaho in the early 19th century . They established immigrant trails in the region by 1849 , including the Oregon and California trails . The forest was used by early settlers primarily for extractive industries . Fur trappers of the Hudson 's Bay Company discovered the Stanley Basin in the northern part of the forest in the 1820s , but mostly avoided it due to the scarcity of beaver . For early settlers , the welfare of their community was dependent upon timber supply , regulation of stream flow for irrigation , and use of the land for cattle range . Mining began in the 1860s , peaked in the 1880s , and fluctuated over the following century with the extraction of gold , silver , lead , and zinc .

  "The final race of the season was run in conditions that were never quite wet enough for drivers to use wet tyres , but never quite dry enough for slick tyres to provide enough grip . While Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton fought over the race lead , Sebastian Vettel was involved in a first @-@ lap clash with Bruno Senna that damaged his exhaust and spun him around , relegating him to last place . Senna retired on the spot , as did Sergio Pérez , who was caught in the crossfire . The race was one of attrition , with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean also crashing out early . Button seized the lead from Hamilton , but soon found himself under pressure from Nico Hülkenberg and lost the lead to the German driver on lap 18 , and second place to Hamilton shortly thereafter . The field stabilised themselves after the first round of stops , with Vettel in the lower points and Fernando Alonso running fourth when he needed a podium to stand any chance of being champion . Hülkenberg spun on lap 48 and lost the lead to Hamilton , but caught the McLaren on lap 54 as they encountered lapped traffic .

A slow stop for Vettel relegated him to twelfth and swinging the balance of power in Alonso 's favour . In the last ten laps of the race , Vettel began to make his way back up the order until he was seventh , just enough to secure the title , but leaving him vulnerable if the damage he received on the first lap — which by now had left a long crack running along the floor of his car — got worse . Vettel 's seventh became sixth when Michael Schumacher moved aside to let Vettel through . Two laps from the end of the race , Paul di Resta crashed heavily as he came onto the main straight , forcing the deployment of the safety car . Button won the race , with Alonso second and Massa third , but Vettel 's sixth place was enough to secure his third consecutive World Drivers ' Championship . Kimi Räikkönen finished the season third overall , having benefited from Hamilton 's retirement to hold onto the place following a bizarre incident in which he left the circuit and attempted to rejoin by taking to the support paddock pit lane , only to find the way blocked and forcing him to double back and find another way onto the circuit . In his final race in Formula One , Schumacher 's seventh place saw him finish the season in thirteenth place overall ; his worst performance over a season since he contested six rounds during the 1991 season . In the World Constructors ' Championship , Ferrari secured second place from McLaren with two cars on the podium , while Kamui Kobayashi 's ninth place was not enough for Sauber to take sixth from Mercedes , and Marussia lost tenth place to Caterham when Vitaly Petrov secured the team 's best result of the season with eleventh place .

  "A second influence on Durkheim 's view of society beyond Comte 's positivism was the epistemological outlook called social realism . Although he never explicitly exposed it , Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society . As an epistemology of science , realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the individual 's perception of them . This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism . Empiricists such as David Hume had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception . According to empiricists , all realities are thus merely perceived : they do not exist independently of our perceptions , and have no causal power in themselves . Comte 's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations . Going beyond this , Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover \" apparent \" laws , but would be able to discover the inherent nature of society .",

Jesus ' words are not to be taken literally – we should seek the supercelestial [ ὑπερουράνιος ] meaning in which the true route to salvation is revealed .

It is more important to give up sinful passions than external wealth . If the rich man is to be saved , all he must do is to follow the two commandments , and while material wealth is of no value to God , it can be used to alleviate the suffering of our neighbor .",

  "Many species of Bombus , including the group sometimes called Psithyrus ( cuckoo bumblebees ) , have evolved Müllerian mimicry , where the different bumblebees in a region resemble each other , so that a young predator need only learn to avoid any of them once . For example , in California a group of bumblebees consists of largely black species including B. californicus , B. caliginosus , B. vandykei , B. vosnesenskii , B. insularis and B. fernaldae . Other bees in California include a group of species all banded black and yellow . In each case , Müllerian mimicry provides the bees in the group with a selective advantage . In addition , parasitic ( cuckoo ) bumblebees resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance , at least in areas like Europe where parasite @-@ host co @-@ speciation is common ; but this too may be explained as Müllerian mimicry , rather than requiring the parasite 's coloration to deceive the host ( aggressive mimicry ) .",

  "In spite of the unsuccessful UN ground action from June 25 to August 4 , the air battle for South Korea was considered a crucial success for the UN forces . Able to attain air superiority over its outmatched enemy , the UN air force was able to concentrate its efforts on attacking the North Koreans on the ground , and in the process inflicted significant casualties . This , in conjunction with bombing missions against North Korean armor , supplies and ports , greatly hampered North Korean efforts against the Pusan Perimeter , contributing to the eventual UN victory on the ground . Stratemeyer later said the victory was \" short and sweet \" but attributed the victory more to the North Koreans ' lack of a modern air force than to skill ; he felt his pilots were just as inexperienced as the UN ground troops and could have faced similar defeats had they not outnumbered the North Koreans . The victory in the air battles also meant a large number of other advantages for the war during August and September ; UN troops were able to move by day without fear of air attack , and UN naval ships could operate close to shore . North Korean troops themselves were confined to night attacks to avoid UN aircraft and much of its limited navy was also destroyed .

  "A significant indirect influence was Thomas Simpson , who achieved a result that closely resembled de Moivre 's .

  "The most common explanation for the sinking among modern historians is that the ship was unstable for a number of reasons . When a strong gust of wind hit the sails at a critical moment , the open gunports proved fatal , the ship flooded and quickly foundered . Coates offered a variant of this hypothesis , which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking , and which even fought in actions in the rough seas off Brittany , unexpectedly foundered : the ship had accumulated additional weight over the years in service and finally become unseaworthy . That the ship was turning after firing all the cannons on one side has been questioned by Marsden after examination of guns recovered in both the 19th and 20th centuries ; guns from both sides were found still loaded . This has been interpreted to mean that something else could have gone wrong since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure the gunports before making a potentially risky turn .",

  "The All @-@ China Women 's Federation is the largest women ’ s organization in China and the only women ’ s organization still in existence that appeared before the 1980s . However , the ACWF has recently been struggling to adequately represent a diverse range of women ’ s interest , and some critics believe that women ’ s growing needs ought to be represented by a more diverse group of organizations . Most women @-@ interest NGOs operating in China are currently listed under the ACWF and have sought a close relationship with the organization to gain legitimacy and protection . Some of the organizations that are listed outside the ACWF are run by women who are affiliated with the ACWF , so there is considerable overlap . New women 's groups have more freedom in exploring sensitive topics and alternative theories on gender because they are not affiliated with the government in any manner . The ACWF has encouraged some of these groups to form , and brought others under their umbrella , which extends the reach of the ACWF . However , given the limited resources available to the women ’ s movement , and the ACWF historically representing the only large organization , tensions exists between these women ’ s groups and the ACWF .",
  "In 1908 , the New York State Legislature created Route 22 , an unsigned legislative route that was initially split into two segments .

When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924 , all of legislative Route 22 north of Riparius became part of NY 6 , which continued south toward Glens Falls on what is now US 9 . At the same time , the section of modern NY 9N between Saratoga Springs and Lake George was designated as part of NY 10 .

  "A dilution effect is seen when animals living in a group \" dilute \" their risk of attack , each individual being just one of many in the group . George C. Williams and W.D.

  "According to the historians Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus , writing at a far later date , the earliest Roman army existed in the 8th century BC . During this period Rome itself was probably little more than a fortified hilltop settlement and its army a relatively small force , whose activities were limited \" mainly [ to ] raiding and cattle rustling with the occasional skirmish @-@ like battle \" . Historian Theodor Mommsen referred to it as Rome 's curiate army , named for its presumed subdivision along the boundaries of Rome 's three founding tribes ( Latin : curiae ) , the Ramnians , Tities and Luceres .

Some designs are reserved for royalties , and even banned to be worn by commoners . Consequently , a person 's rank could be determined by the pattern of the batik he or she wore .

  "\" Ode on Melancholy \" is the shortest of the 1819 spring odes at three stanzas of 10 lines . Originally , the poem contained four stanzas , but the original first stanza was removed before publication in 1820 for stylistic reasons . The poem describes the narrator 's opinions on melancholy and is addressed specifically to the reader , unlike the narrative of many of the other odes . The lyric nature of the poem allows the poet to describe the onset of melancholy and then provides the reader with different methods of dealing with the emotions involved . Using personification , the poem creates characters out of Joy , Pleasure , Delight , and Beauty , and allows them to interact with two other characters which take the shape of a male and his female mistress mentioned ( line 17 ) . Keats himself fails to appear as a character in the poem , as there is no mention of the poet himself suffering from melancholy . In the final stanza , the poet describes the mistress as dwelling in Beauty , but modifies the beauty by saying that it \" must die \" ( line 21 ) . Harold Bloom suggests that this provides the poem with a hint of Keats 's philosophy of negative capability , as only the beauty that will die meets the poem 's standard of true beauty . The image of the bursting of Joy 's grape ( line 28 ) gives the poem a theme of sexuality . According to critics , the bursting of the grape alludes to the passing from the moment of ultimate sexual pleasure to the decreased pleasure of a post @-@ orgasmic state .",

  "Tallon was prominent in the next match against South Australia in Adelaide . The hosts included Australia captain Don Bradman in their ranks , making a comeback from illness . The match was mainly noted for Bradman 's 233 but Tallon impressed him by taking two particularly difficult catches , one of which dismissed the Australian captain himself . Bradman also praised Tallon for conceding only seven byes in a total of 642 , particularly his ability to take balls passing down the leg side . Tallon then scored 88 in Queensland 's reply . Bradman opined that he had a \" clean @-@ hitting crisp style ... attacking , positive , and with a technique to rival most first @-@ class batsmen \" . Despite this , Queensland fell to defeat by an innings and 226 runs . He followed this with 51 in a defeat to New South Wales .

While Tallon was performing strongly in Australia , the national team were in South Africa and defeated their hosts 4 – 0 . Nevertheless , it was another unsuccessful season for Queensland ; Tallon did not experience a win and suffered losses in three of his six matches .",

  "The stories in Scientific Detective Monthly were almost always detective stories , but they were only occasionally science fiction , as in many cases the science appearing in the stories already had practical applications . In the first issue , for example , \" The Mystery of the Bulawayo Diamond \" , by Arthur B. Reeve , mentions unusual science , but the mystery is solved by use of a bolometer to detect a blush on the face of a black girl . The murderer in \" The Campus Murder Mystery \" , by Ralph W. Wilkins , freezes the body to conceal the manner of death ; a chemical catalyst and electrical measurements of palm sweat provide the scientific elements in two other stories in the same issue . The only genuine science fiction story in the first issue is \" The Perfect Counterfeit \" by Captain S.P. Meek , in which a matter duplicator has been used to counterfeit paper money . Van Dine 's Philo Vance novel , The Bishop Murder Case , began serialization in the first issue , which probably assisted sales , since the hardcover edition of the novel , which had appeared only a few months previously , had sold well . It was not science fiction , however , and throughout the magazine 's run , only one or two stories per issue include elements that would qualify them as science fiction . Mike Ashley , a historian of the field , suggests that Gernsback was more interested in stories about the science of detection than in imaginary science : most of Scientific Detective Monthly 's contents were gadget stories , of a kind which Gernsback had been publishing in his other magazines for some time .

  "All along the ANZAC perimeter , Turkish troops continued trying to advance using fire and manoeuvre .

  "The Production Code was officially scrapped in 1968 , to be replaced by the first version of the modern rating system . That year , two horror films came out that heralded directions American cinema would take in the next decade , with major consequences for the B movie .

Building on the achievement of B genre predecessors like Invasion of the Body Snatchers in its subtextual exploration of social and political issues , it doubled as a highly effective thriller and an incisive allegory for both the Vietnam War and domestic racial conflicts .

  "Before , during and after his mayoralty , Sharpe played a major role in promoting sanitary reform , often meeting considerable opposition and needing to use his oratorical , political and persuasive skills to the full . A campaign to deal with the problems had been initiated in 1847 by two Lancaster doctors , Thomas Howitt and Edward Denis de Vitre . Sharpe joined them , drawing extensively on his experience of having accompanied Professor Richard Owen ( born and educated in Lancaster ) on his tour of inspection of the town in 1844 . In 1848 Robert Rawlinson , also from Lancaster , was appointed as local surveyor , and published a further report that recommended new sewers and drains and the construction of a waterworks . Although Sharpe agreed in principle with the report , he was not satisfied with its details . Later that year , which was during his mayoralty , he travelled to London with the town clerk and a former mayor to meet representatives of the General Board of Health , including its chairman , Lord Morpeth , and its secretary Edwin Chadwick . As a result of this meeting , the Board of Health appointed James Smith from Scotland as an inspector , and commissioned him to produce a further report on Lancaster 's problems . Smith 's investigation took place in January 1849 , and his report was received in July . In his conclusions , Smith noted that Lancaster was favourably situated to provide a healthy environment for its inhabitants , and that this could be achieved by \" a complete and constant supply of pure and soft water , and ... a thorough system of drainage and sewerage \" . Subsequently , an Act of Parliament gave approval for these measures to be carried out , and in 1852 royal assent was given for the waterworks to be constructed . Delays , disputes and controversies continued , until the waterworks was eventually opened in 1855 , when work on the drainage and sewage systems was already under way . This enabled underground pipes for the two systems to be laid simultaneously . Sharpe had played a significant part in arranging Queen Victoria 's visit to Lancaster in October 1851 , and with Paley designed four triumphal arches for the occasion . He also took part in the proceedings on the day , escorting the Queen , Prince Albert , and the Prince of Wales ( the future King Edward VII ) to the top of the castle tower .",

He added : \" Nobody wants to read other people 's reflections on life and religion and politics , but the routine of their day , properly recorded , is always interesting , and will become more so as conditions change with the years \" .

  "In Nappalli , the appellant was dismissed from an educational institution for his refusal to participate in the aforementioned acts . Central to his claim was the submission that these acts were religious practices that went against his belief as a Jehovah 's Witness and thus infringed his constitutional right to practice and profess his religion guaranteed by Article 15 . However , the Court held that since \" religion \" in Singapore under the Constitution is restricted to \" a citizen 's faith in a personal God \" and does not include \" a system of belief in one 's own country \" , the acts in question were not religious practices . Hence , the appellant 's rights had not been contravened .

  "Many factors have influenced the construction of dams along the Snake River . A total of fifteen dams have been constructed along the Snake River for a multitude of different purposes , from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its mouth on Lake Wallula , a slackwater reservoir formed behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River . Dams on the Snake can be grouped into three major categories . From its headwaters to the beginning of Hells Canyon , many small dams block the Snake to provide irrigation water . Between here and Hells Canyon , the first dam on the Snake , Swan Falls Dam , was built in 1901 . In Hells Canyon , a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from the river 's lofty decrease in elevation over a comparatively small distance .

  "Following the raids , the Commonwealth military forces in the Pacific took steps to prevent further attacks by raiders . The Royal Australian Air Force and Royal New Zealand Air Force flew an increased number of patrols in search of raiders operating near major ports . In addition , the Australian Naval Board requested that the British Admiralty authorise the redeployment of Australian naval units to meet the threat posed by raiders . This was agreed to , and the light cruiser HMAS Sydney and armed merchant cruiser HMAS Kanimbla returned to Australia from other stations . This allowed naval protection to be provided to Nauru and Ocean islands , and the armed merchant cruiser HMAS Manoora arrived off Ocean Island on 4 January 1941 escorting Trienza . Several Australian and New Zealand warships maintained a continual presence off the islands during subsequent months , and two field guns were deployed to each island . The attacks also led to the introduction of convoys between Australia and New Zealand . The naval authorities were able to use the intelligence they gained from the prisoners landed at Emirau to re @-@ route merchant ships away from the areas in which the German raiders were operating ; this greatly reduced the effectiveness of the raiders , and Komet and Orion only sank three ships in the period between the attack on Nauru and their return to Europe in late 1941 .",

  "For people whose injuries are high enough to interfere with breathing , there is great emphasis on airway clearance during this stage of recovery . Weakness of respiratory muscles impairs the ability to cough effectively , allowing secretions to accumulate within the lungs . As SCI patients suffer from reduced total lung capacity and tidal volume , physical therapists teach them accessory breathing techniques ( e.g. apical breathing , glossopharyngeal breathing ) that typically are not taught to healthy individuals . Physical therapy treatment for airway clearance may include manual percussions and vibrations , postural drainage , respiratory muscle training , and assisted cough techniques . Patients are taught to increase their intra @-@ abdominal pressure by leaning forward to induce cough and clear mild secretions . The quad cough technique is done lying on the back with the therapist applying pressure on the abdomen in the rhythm of the cough to maximize expiratory flow and mobilize secretions . Manual abdominal compression is another technique used to increase expiratory flow which later improves coughing . Other techniques used to manage respiratory dysfunction include respiratory muscle pacing , use of a constricting abdominal binder , ventilator @-@ assisted speech , and mechanical ventilation .",

Around that time , it split with India , leaving it isolated in the Indian Ocean and separated from nearby Africa by the Mozambique Channel , a deep channel with a minimum width of approximately 560 km ( 350 mi ) .

  "The combination of agnatic kinship and the feudal system , which formalised mutual obligations of service and protection , organised through heritable jurisdictions , has been seen as creating the Highland clan system . The head of a clan was usually the eldest son of the last chief of the most powerful sept or branch . The leading families of a clan formed the fine , often seen as equivalent to Lowland lairds , providing council in peace and leadership in war , and below them were the daoine usisle ( in Gaelic ) or tacksmen ( in Scots ) , who managed the clan lands and collected the rents . Most of the followers of the clan were tenants , who supplied labour to the clan heads and could be called upon to act as soldiers when needed . In the early modern era they usually took the clan name as their surname , turning it into a massive , if often fictive , kin group . Economic change and the imposition of royal justice had begun to undermine the clan system before the eighteenth century , but the process was accelerated after the Jacobite rising of 1745 . Highland dress was banned , clansmen were forcible disarmed , there was the compulsory purchase of heritable jurisdictions , many chiefs were exiled and ordinary clansmen were sent to the colonies as indentured labourers . Within a generation , these factors reduced most clan leaders to the status of simple landholders , without independent military power .",

  "English taxation after the Norman Conquest of 1066 was based on the geld or danegeld , a national tax paid by all free men , those who were not serfs or slaves . The geld was based on the number of hides of land owned by the taxpayer , and could be demanded by the king and assessed at varying levels without the need for consultation with the barons or other subjects . During King Henry I 's reign , an increasing number of exemptions , and the difficulties encountered in collecting the geld , lowered its importance to the Exchequer — the treasury of England .

Stephen 's successor , King Henry II , collected the geld only twice , once in 1155 and again in 1161 – 1162 .

In January 1863 the Foreign Secretary , Lord Russell , notified Bulloch , who had purchased the ships in his own name , that the ships would be prevented from sailing if they were doing so to form part of the fleet of a nation currently at war . Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863 , nominally on behalf of the Egyptian government , with the intention of transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea . The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships , so this was superficially plausible . North Carolina , later HMS Scorpion , was given the cover name of El Toussan and Mississippi , later HMS Wivern , received the name of El Monnassir .

She believed she was reading for the role of Rachel , the \" young , pretty one \" , and was surprised to discover that she was wanted for Jenny , the \" northern housewife \" .

  "The genus Oryzomys currently includes about eight species distributed from the eastern United States ( O. palustris ) into northwestern South America ( O. gorgasi ) . O. peninsulae is part of the O. couesi section , which is centered on the widespread Central American O. couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions . Many aspects of the systematics of this section remain unclear and it is likely that the current classification underestimates the group 's true diversity . Oryzomys was previously a much larger genus , but most species were progressively removed in various studies , culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that excluded more than forty species from the genus . Oryzomys and many of the species removed from it are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ( \" rice rats \" ) , a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species , and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae , along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents .",

  "In contrast to DNA damage , a mutation is a change in the base sequence of the DNA . A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands , and , thus , a mutation cannot be repaired . At the cellular level , mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation . Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates . In a population of cells , mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on the ability of the cell to survive and reproduce . Although distinctly different from each other , DNA damages and mutations are related because DNA damages often cause errors of DNA synthesis during replication or repair ; these errors are a major source of mutation .",

  "Glaciologists researching the North Cascades found that all 47 monitored glaciers are receding while four glaciers — Spider Glacier , Lewis Glacier , Milk Lake Glacier and David Glacier — have disappeared completely since 1985 . The White Chuck Glacier ( near Glacier Peak ) is a particularly dramatic example . The glacier area shrank from 3 @.@ 1 km2 ( 1 @.@ 2 sq mi ) in 1958 to 0 @.@ 9 km2 ( 0 @.@ 35 sq mi ) by 2002 . Between 1850 and 1950 , the Boulder Glacier on the southeast flank of Mount Baker retreated 8 @,@ 700 feet ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) . William Long of the United States Forest Service observed the glacier beginning to advance due to cooler / wetter weather in 1953 . This was followed by a 743 metres ( 2 @,@ 438 ft ) advance by 1979 . The glacier again retreated 450 m ( 1 @,@ 480 ft ) from 1987 to 2005 , leaving barren terrain behind . This retreat has occurred during a period of reduced winter snowfall and higher summer temperatures . In this region of the Cascades , winter snowpack has declined 25 % since 1946 , and summer temperatures have risen 0 @.@ 7 ° C ( 1 @.@ 2 ° F ) during the same period . The reduced snowpack has occurred despite a small increase in winter precipitation — thus , it reflects warmer winter temperatures leading to rainfall and melting on glaciers even during the winter . As of 2005 , 67 % of the North Cascade glaciers observed are in disequilibrium and will not survive the continuation of the present climate . These glaciers will eventually disappear unless temperatures fall and frozen precipitation increases . The remaining glaciers are expected to stabilize , unless the climate continues to warm , but will be much reduced in size .",

However , perceiving that they now had a prime opportunity to bring Themistocles down for good , the Spartans again levelled accusations of Themistocles 's complicity in Pausanias 's treason . They demanded that he be tried by the ' Congress of Greeks ' , rather than in Athens , although it seems that in the end he was actually summoned to Athens to stand trial . Perhaps realising he had little hope of surviving this trial , Themistocles fled , first to Kerkyra , and thence to Admetus , king of Molossia . Themistocles 's flight probably only served to convince his accusers of his guilt , and he was declared a traitor in Athens , his property to be confiscated . It should be noted that both Diodorus and Plutarch considered that the charges were false , and made solely for the purposes of destroying Themistocles . The Spartans sent ambassadors to Admetus , threatening that the whole of Greece would go to war with the Molossians unless they surrendered Themistocles . Admetus , however , allowed Themistocles to escape , giving him a large sum of gold to aid him on his way . Themistocles then fled from Greece , apparently never to return , thus effectively bringing his political career to an end .",

  "While it was long thought that the Chinese had developed the blast furnace and cast iron as their first method of iron production , Donald Wagner ( the author of the above referenced study ) has published a more recent paper that supersedes some of the statements in the earlier work ; the newer paper still places the date of the first cast @-@ iron artifacts at the 5th and 4th centuries BC , but also provides evidence of earlier bloomery furnace use , which migrated from China to Western parts and Central Asia during the beginning of the Chinese Bronze Age of the late Longshan culture ( 2000 BC ) . He suggests that early blast furnace and cast iron production evolved from furnaces used to melt bronze . Certainly , though , iron was essential to military success by the time the State of Qin had unified China ( 221 BC ) . Usage of the blast and cupola furnace remained widespread during the Song and Tang Dynasties . By the 11th century AD , the Song Dynasty Chinese iron industry made a remarkable switch of resources from charcoal to bituminous coal in casting iron and steel , sparing thousands of acres of woodland from felling . This may have happened as early as the 4th century AD .",

  "Canadian training for D @-@ Day had begun as early as July 1943 , when Lieutenant @-@ General Andrew McNaughton of the First Canadian Army informed Harry Crerar , commander of II Canadian Corps , that the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division might play a role in the invasion of France . Initial training was demanding , and complicated by the lack of any landing craft to practice with , either LCAs or LCTs . Field exercises in Scotland commenced in August and September 1943 , and succeeded in establishing unique techniques and equipment for use by armoured and artillery regiments in storming the beach ; the most significant were the amphibious duplex drive tanks ( DD tanks ) . Mechanisms were also developed to allow artillery to bombard the beach while still attached to their landing craft . Through the winter of 1943 , units jointly developed more advanced assault tactics among the Juno regiments .",

  "The 19th century was a turbulent time for Spain . Those in favour of reforming Spain 's government vied for political power with conservatives , who tried to prevent reforms from taking place . Some liberals , in a tradition that had started with the Spanish Constitution of 1812 , sought to limit the power of the monarchy of Spain and to establish a liberal state . The reforms of 1812 did not last after King Ferdinand VII dissolved the Constitution and ended the Trienio Liberal government . Twelve successful coups were carried out between 1814 and 1874 . Until the 1850s , the economy of Spain was primarily based on agriculture . There was little development of a bourgeois industrial or commercial class . The land @-@ based oligarchy remained powerful ; a small number of people held large estates called latifundia as well as all the important government positions .",
  "In modern times , railroads are primarily used to haul bulk quantities of cargo over long distances . Unless a manufacturing or distribution facility has a direct connection to the railroad , the remainder of the trip must be handled by truck . Recent implementation of \" just in time \" strategies have resulted in the increased use of trucks to help satisfy businesses ' fluid inventory needs . Using this strategy , businesses gain the ability to reduce the costs associated with excess inventory and larger warehousing facilities by requiring more frequent deliveries . According to an industry group , many retail , commercial , and government services require daily or weekly deliveries to keep supplies or merchandise on hand . Many hospitals have also moved to \" just in time \" inventory systems . The nation 's busiest gas stations require deliveries of fuel several times per day , while the average station receives fuel every two to three days . Grocery stores require deliveries of perishable food items every two to three days .",

  "In 1763 , Edward Stone , at Oxford , isolated the active ingredient of aspirin in his discovery of salicylic acid . A French chemist , Charles Frederic Gerhardt , was the first to prepare acetylsalicylic acid in 1853 . In the course of his work on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides , he mixed acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid ( sodium salicylate ) . A vigorous reaction ensued , and the resulting melt soon solidified . Since no structural theory existed at that time , Gerhardt called the compound he obtained \" salicylic @-@ acetic anhydride \" ( wasserfreie Salicylsäure @-@ Essigsäure ) .

  "Mariners have a way to safely navigate around tropical cyclones . They split tropical cyclones in two , based on their direction of motion , and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere ( the left in the Southern Hemisphere ) . Sailors term the right side the dangerous semicircle since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm , as the cyclone 's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive . The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened ( subtractive ) in this portion of the storm ( but are still potentially quite hazardous ) . The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path ( crossing the T ) . Those traveling through the dangerous semicircle are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible .
