  "Early 20th scholarly analysis of American music tended to interpret European @-@ derived classical traditions as the most worthy of study , with the folk , religious , and traditional musics of the common people denigrated as low @-@ class and of little artistic or social worth . American music history was compared to the much longer historical record of European nations , and was found wanting , leading writers like the composer Arthur Farwell to ponder what sorts of musical traditions might arise from American culture , in his 1915 Music in America . In 1930 , John Tasker Howard 's Our American Music became a standard analysis , focusing on largely on concert music composed in the United States . Since the analysis of musicologist Charles Seeger in the mid @-@ 20th century , American music history has often been described as intimately related to perceptions of race and ancestry . Under this view , the diverse racial and ethnic background of the United States has both promoted a sense of musical separation between the races , while still fostering constant acculturation , as elements of European , African , and indigenous musics have shifted between fields . Gilbert Chase 's America 's Music , from the Pilgrims to the Present , was the first major work to examine the music of the entire United States , and recognize folk traditions as more culturally significant than music for the concert hall . Chase 's analysis of a diverse American musical identity has remained the dominant view among the academic establishment . Until the 1960s and 1970s , however , most musical scholars in the United States continued to study European music , limiting themselves only to certain fields of American music , especially European @-@ derived classical and operatic styles , and sometimes African American jazz . More modern musicologists and ethnomusicologists have studied subjects ranging from the national musical identity to the individual styles and techniques of specific communities in a particular time of American history . Prominent recent studies of American music include Charles Hamm 's Music in the New World from 1983 , and Richard Crawford 's America 's Musical Life from 2001 .",
  "Early historians , including the 6th century cleric Gildas , have noted 383 as a significant point in Welsh history , as it is stated in literature as the foundation point of several medieval royal dynasties . In that year the Roman general Magnus Maximus , or Macsen Wledig , stripped all of western and northern Britain of troops and senior administrators , to launch a successful bid for imperial power ; continuing to rule Britain from Gaul as emperor . Gildas , writing in about 540 , says that Maximus departed Britain , taking with him all of its Roman troops , armed bands , governors and the flower of its youth , never to return . Having left with the troops and Roman administrators , and planning to continue as the ruler of Britain in the future , his practical course was to transfer local authority to local rulers . The earliest Welsh genealogies give Maximus the role of founding father for several royal dynasties , including those of Powys and Gwent . It was this transfer of power that has given rise to the belief that he was the father of the Welsh Nation . He is given as the ancestor of a Welsh king on the Pillar of Eliseg , erected nearly 500 years after he left Britain , and he figures in lists of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales .",
  "In her memoir , Stanton credits the Cadys ' neighbor , Rev.

Writing of her brother Eleazar 's death in 1826 , Stanton remembers trying to comfort her father , saying that she would try to be all her brother had been . At the time , her father 's response devastated Stanton : \" Oh , my daughter , I wish you were a boy ! \" Understanding from this that her father valued boys above girls , Stanton tearfully took her disappointment to Hosack , whose firm belief in her abilities counteracted her father 's perceived disparagement . Hosack went on to teach Stanton Greek , encouraged her to read widely , and ultimately bequeathed to her his own Greek lexicon along with other books . His confirmation of her intellectual abilities strengthened Stanton 's confidence and self @-@ esteem .",

  "Stephen remains a popular subject for historical study : David Crouch suggests that after King John he is \" arguably the most written @-@ about medieval king of England \" . Modern historians vary in their assessments of Stephen as a king . Historian R. H.

Stephen 's lack of sound policy judgement and his mishandling of international affairs , leading to the loss of Normandy and his consequent inability to win the civil war in England , is also highlighted by another of his biographers , David Crouch . Historian and biographer Edmund King , whilst painting a slightly more positive picture than Davis , also concludes that Stephen , while a stoic , pious and genial leader , was also rarely , if ever , his own man , usually relying upon stronger characters such as his brother or wife . Historian Keith Stringer provides a more positive portrayal of Stephen , arguing that his ultimate failure as king was the result of external pressures on the Norman state , rather than the result of personal failings .",
  "Bridging wires are rods that couple together resonators that are not adjacent . They can be used to produce poles of attenuation in the stopband . This has the benefit of increasing the stopband rejection . When the pole is placed near the passband edge , it also has the benefit of increasing roll @-@ off and narrowing the transition band . The typical effects of some of these on filter frequency response are shown in figure 11 . Bridging across a single resonator ( figure 11b ) can produce a pole of attenuation in the high stopband . Bridging across two resonators ( figure 11c ) can produce a pole of attenuation in both the high and the low stopband . Using multiple bridges ( figure 11d ) will result in multiple poles of attenuation . In this way , the attenuation of the stopbands can be deepened over a broad frequency range .",

  "The defence of the Isthmus of Corinth by the Allies changed the nature of the war . The Persians did not attempt to attack the isthmus by land , realising they probably could not breach it . This essentially reduced the conflict to a naval one . Themistocles now proposed what was in hindsight the strategic masterstroke in the Allied campaign ; to lure the Persian fleet to battle in the straits of Salamis . However , as successful as this was , there was no need for the Persians to fight at Salamis to win the war ; it has been suggested that the Persians were either overconfident , or overeager to finish the campaign . Thus , the Allied victory at Salamis must at least partially be ascribed to a Persian strategic blunder . After Salamis , the Persian strategy changed . Mardonius sought to exploit dissensions between the Allies in order to fracture the alliance . In particular , he sought to win over the Athenians , which would leave the Allied fleet unable to oppose Persian landings on the Peloponnesus . Although Herodotus tells us that Mardonius was keen to fight a decisive battle , his actions in the run @-@ up to Plataea are not particularly consistent with this . He seems to have been willing to accept battle on his terms , but he waited either for the Allies to attack , or for the alliance to collapse ignominiously . The Allied strategy for 479 BC was something of a mess ; the Peloponnesians only agreed to march north in order to save the alliance , and it appears that the Allied leadership had little idea how to force a battle that they could win . It was the botched attempt to retreat from Plataea that finally delivered the Allies battle on their terms . Mardonius may have been overeager for victory ; there was no need to attack the Allies , and by doing so he played to the main Allied tactical strength , combat in the melee . The Allied victory at Plataea can also therefore be seen as partially the result of a Persian mistake .",

  "Like many animals that evolved in isolation from significant predators , the dodo was entirely fearless of humans . This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors . Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships ' provisions , archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation . Bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century , which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high , broken terrain .

Although he continued to be lauded for his work , Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research , and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful .

  "Because only bare details are known of Bosch 's life , biographical interpretation of his work becomes extremely difficult for academics , who must largely rely on conjecture . Individual motifs and elements of symbolism may be explained , but so far relating these to each other and to his work as a whole has remained elusive . The enigmatic scenes depicted on the panels of the inner triptych of The Garden of Earthly Delights have been studied by many scholars , who have often arrived at contradictory interpretations . Analyses based on symbolic systems ranging from the alchemical , astrological , and heretical to the folkloric and subconscious have all attempted to explain the complex objects and ideas presented in the work . Until the early 20th century , Bosch 's paintings were generally thought to incorporate attitudes of Medieval didactic literature and sermons . Charles De Tolnay wrote :",

According to Chandler , by this time Redding and Mitchell had begun to complain about their limited input .

  "The earliest literary references to Arthur come from Welsh and Breton sources . There have been few attempts to define the nature and character of Arthur in the pre @-@ Galfridian tradition as a whole , rather than in a single text or text / story @-@ type . A 2007 academic survey that does attempt this by Thomas Green identifies three key strands to the portrayal of Arthur in this earliest material . The first is that he was a peerless warrior who functioned as the monster @-@ hunting protector of Britain from all internal and external threats . Some of these are human threats , such as the Saxons he fights in the Historia Brittonum , but the majority are supernatural , including giant cat @-@ monsters , destructive divine boars , dragons , dogheads , giants , and witches . The second is that the pre @-@ Galfridian Arthur was a figure of folklore ( particularly topographic or onomastic folklore ) and localised magical wonder @-@ tales , the leader of a band of superhuman heroes who live in the wilds of the landscape . The third and final strand is that the early Welsh Arthur had a close connection with the Welsh Otherworld Annwn . On the one hand , he launches assaults on Otherworldly fortresses in search of treasure and frees their prisoners . On the other , his warband in the earliest sources includes former pagan gods , and his wife and his possessions are clearly Otherworldly in origin .",
  "Female macaroni penguins can begin breeding at around five years of age , while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old . Females breed at a younger age because the male population is larger .

Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony , sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory , and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts .

In their formative years , botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists , but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public . The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities , not by its living collections . The interest in economic plants now has less relevance , and the concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared , while a fascination with the curious , beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish .",

I ran across the hall and called in a woman doctor , Dr. Haberski , to examine him . She pronounced him dead .",

  "A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk . This trunk typically contains woody tissue for strength , and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the tree to another . For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier . Below the ground , the roots branch and spread out widely ; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture and nutrients from the soil . Above ground , the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots . The shoots typically bear leaves , which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis , providing the food for the tree 's growth and development . Flowers and fruit may also be present , but some trees , such as conifers , instead have pollen cones and seed cones ; others , such as tree ferns , produce spores instead .",

  "Modern scholarship inclines to the view that L 'incoronazione was the result of collaboration between Monteverdi and others , with the old composer playing a guiding role . Composers who may have assisted include Sacrati , Benedetto Ferrari and Francesco Cavalli . Ringer suggests that Monteverdi 's age and health may have prevented him from completing the opera without help from younger colleagues ; he speculates about an arrangement resembling \" the workshop of Rubens , who might design a painting and handle the important details himself but leave the more mundane aspects ... to younger apprentice artists . \" The musicologist Alan Curtis believes that only a single collaborator was involved , and published his 1989 edition of L 'incoronazione under the joint authorship of Monteverdi and Sacrati . The musical analyst Eric Chafe 's study of Monteverdi 's tonal language supports the collaboration theory and postulates that some of the sections in question , including the prologue , the coronation scene and the final duet , reflect Monteverdi 's intentions and may have been written under his direct supervision .",

  "Shelley 's stated aim in Rambles is to raise awareness of the political situation in Italy and to convince readers to aid the revolutionaries in their fight for independence . She addresses her readers as English citizens , arguing that they in particular \" ought to sympathise in [ the Italians ' ] struggles ; for the aspiration for free institutions all over the world has its source in England \" . On a general level , she articulates an \" opposition to monarchical government , disapproval of class distinction , abhorrence of slavery and war and their concomitant cruelties \" similar to that in her historical novels Valperga ( 1823 ) and Perkin Warbeck ( 1830 ) . The central theme of the second journey is \" the tyranny of Austrian and French imperialism , and the abuses of papal and priestly authority \" . The solution to Italy 's problems , according to Shelley , is neither \" subjugation \" nor \" revolution \" but rather \" peaceful mediation \" . Ultimately , it is the lessons learned from history that Shelley feels are the most important , which is why she compares the past and present .

The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica ( Illustration 10 ) is an example . It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613 , rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout , then damaged again in 1693 . Rebuilding again began in 1702 , by an unknown architect . Finally , Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade 's completion in 1760 , but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious . While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa , here in Modica the building is heavier , and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design .",

  "The inflammatory response caused by bacteria colonizing near the pyloric antrum induces G cells in the antrum to secrete the hormone gastrin , which travels through the bloodstream to parietal cells in the fundus . Gastrin stimulates the parietal cells to secrete more acid into the stomach lumen , and over time increases the number of parietal cells , as well . The increased acid load damages the duodenum , which may eventually result in ulcers forming in the duodenum .",

  "The gameplay was the second element created for the game , following the graphics created by Jensen . The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have , but aware of how these elements would be presented to the player in the released version . Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles , where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly . Carlsen , initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine , became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles . Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to \" [ keep ] you guessing all the way through \" . Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment , and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game . Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid . He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution , such as a puzzle in Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves that involved simply moving a sun @-@ lit mirror to specific points in a room . In contrast , Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial @-@ and @-@ error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked ; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself . Carlsen designed Limbo 's puzzles to fall between these limits , demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements : a switch panel , an electrified floor , and a chain ; the goal — to use the chain to cross the electrified floor — is immediately obvious to the player , and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely . They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out . The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game . From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters , several would have no idea of how to solve certain puzzles . To improve this , they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions ; for example , when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge , they presented the player with a box @-@ pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics .",

  "\" Medicinal Fried Chicken \" includes several jokes about Pope Benedict XVI and the child sexual abuse scandals that surrounded the Catholic Church when the episode first aired . On three occasions , Cartman uses expanded and modified versions of idiomatic phrases , such as \" is the Pope Catholic ? \" , \" does a bear shit in the woods ? \" , and their combination , \" does the Pope shit in the woods ? \" , which are rhetorical questions used in response to a question where the answer is an emphatic yes . Thus , Cartman implies an affirmative response to questions such as : \" Does the pope help pedophiles get away with their crimes ? \" and \" Is the Pope Catholic ? And making the world safe for pedophiles ? \" These are references to allegations that Pope Benedict XVI ignored warnings and concealed evidence that Rev. Peter Hullermann engaged in several acts of child sexual abuse under the future Pope 's watch as Archbishop of Munich and Freising in the 1980s .

By favoring these routes Utah could force travelers destined for southern California to use a different route than those destined for northern California , with both of these traversing through more cities in Utah than the Lincoln Highway .

  "Tatsunoko vs. Capcom is a tag team @-@ based fighting game in which players control characters with different attacks and fighting styles , and engage in combat to deplete their opponent 's life gauge . The gameplay is set in a 2.5D environment where the characters are rendered in three @-@ dimensional graphics , but their movements are restricted to a two dimensional plane ; they may only move left and right , and upward through the air . Each player may select a team of two characters and can switch between them during combat . Alternatively , players may select one of two \" giant \" characters , who cannot be played as part of a team . When characters switch , the incoming one performs a special attack upon entry , and the previous one can regenerate health . Characters not in play may be used to assist , and to perform powerful team moves . A match ends when a team has no characters left , or when the timer reaches zero — in which case , the team with the most remaining life wins .",

  "In 1535 , three draft bills were presented to Parliament concerning uses and wills , along with one concerning Enrolments . It is from these bills that the Statute of Uses and the succeeding Statute of Enrolments came . The three bills on uses suggested two different ways to deal with the problem . The first proposed severely limiting the situation in which uses could arise , with uses having no legal effect apart from that expressed when they were created . No contract or bargain over land could change the use of that land ; anyone who suffered from the breach of such a contract had limited remedies in the courts . While this scheme would have prevented most of the evils of uses , it would also have submitted property law to the common law and limited other , beneficial developments ; it would also not stop the practice of getting rid of land through a devise , doing nothing to alleviate the King 's financial concerns . The second , and more complex suggestion , was contained in the other two bills on uses . This simply removed the idea of an equitable interest in land , leaving only the idea of a legal interest , and left uses , maintaining the elastic and variable nature of property law rather than submitting it to the more @-@ rigid standards of the common law . Parliament eventually accepted the second idea , and the bill was passed in April 1536 as the Statute of Uses ( 27 Hen.8 c.10 ) . As such , all uses were invalid except for those that imposed an active duty on a trustee , and the beneficiaries of the use were held to be the legal owners , paying tax as a result .",

  "The risk of death in hepatorenal syndrome is very high ; consequently , there is a significant emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS , and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS . As infection ( specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis ) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis , and are common triggers for HRS , specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications to prevent HRS . Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable . The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided . In addition , many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications ( such as some antibiotics ) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS . Also , large volume paracentesis — which is the removal of ascites fluid from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfort — may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS , and should be avoided in individuals at risk . The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large volume paracentesis , and may prevent HRS . Conversely , in individuals with very tense ascites , it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins .",

  "After 1847 the Poor Law Commission was replaced with a Poor Law Board . This was because of the Andover workhouse scandal and the criticism of Henry Parker who was responsible for the Andover union as well as the tensions in Somerset House caused by Chadwick 's failure to become a Poor Law Commissioner . The Poor Law had been altered in 1834 because of increasing costs . The Workhouse Visiting Society which formed in 1858 highlighted conditions in workhouses and led to workhouses being inspected more often . The Union Chargeability Act was passed in 1865 in order to make the financial burden of pauperism be placed upon the whole unions rather than individual parishes . Most Boards of Guardians were middle class and committed to keeping Poor Rates as low as possible . After the Reform Act 1867 there was increasing welfare legislation . As this legislation required local authorities ' support the Poor Law Board was replaced with a Local Government Board in 1871 . The Local Government Board led a crusade against outdoor relief supported by the Charity Organisation Society , an organization which viewed outdoor relief as destroying the self @-@ reliance of the poor . The effect of this renewed effort to deter outdoor relief was to reduce claimants by a third and to increase numbers in the work house by 12 – 15 % . County Councils were formed in 1888 , District Councils in 1894 . This meant that public housing , unlike health and income maintenance , developed outside the scope of the Poor Law . Poor Law policy after the New Poor Law concerning the elderly , the sick and mentally ill and children became more humane . This was in part due to the expense of providing \" mixed workhouses \" as well as changing attitudes regarding the causes and nature of poverty .",

  "From 1923 through the early 1930s , the SH 74 designation was from Echo Lake at what is now an intersection between SH 103 and SH 5 east along Squaw Pass Road to Bergen Park . From here , it followed its current designation to Morrison . SH 74 was paved from Morrison to Evergreen using an oil surface resembling asphalt in late 1928 . This oil surface , which was approximately 1 inch ( 25 mm ) deep , prevented erosion along the roadway in the Bear Creek canyon during floods . By 1938 , the section west of Bergen Park was redesignated as SH 68 , and SH 74 was turned northward to US 40 . The east end was extended into Denver along Alameda Avenue by 1947 . This section terminated at what was then SH 87 in Denver . In 1956 , the Colorado State Highway Department opted to realign sections of SH 74 away from Bear Creek . A section of the road between Evergreen and Kittredge was resurfaced and widened the next year .

  "Tropical cyclones form due to latent heat driven by significant thunderstorm activity , and are warm core with well @-@ defined circulations . Certain criteria need to be met for their formation . In most situations , water temperatures of at least 26 @.@ 5 ° C ( 79 @.@ 7 ° F ) are needed down to a depth of at least 50 m ( 160 ft ) ; waters of this temperature cause the overlying atmosphere to be unstable enough to sustain convection and thunderstorms . Another factor is rapid cooling with height , which allows the release of the heat of condensation that powers a tropical cyclone . High humidity is needed , especially in the lower @-@ to @-@ mid troposphere ; when there is a great deal of moisture in the atmosphere , conditions are more favorable for disturbances to develop . Low amounts of wind shear are needed , as high shear is disruptive to the storm 's circulation .

  "Until the authorization of the Montana class all US battleships were built within the size limits for the Panama Canal . The main reason for this was logistical : the largest US shipyards were located on the East Coast of the United States , while the United States had territorial interests in both oceans . Requiring the battleships to fit within the Panama Canal took days off the transition time from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean by allowing ships to move through the canal instead of sailing around South America . By the time of the Two Ocean Navy bill , the Navy realized that ship designs could no longer be limited by the Panama Canal and thus approved the Montana class knowing that the ships would be unable to clear the locks . This shift in policy meant that the Montana class would have been the only World War II – era US battleships to be adequately armored against guns of the same power as their own .",

The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop . According to the chronicler , the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop , Hervey le Breton , and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks . Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate . The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln , which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109 .",

  "The new candle sustained some minor damage over its first few years . On November 20 , 1970 , heavy rain and inclement weather snapped a wire helping keep the structure in place , and firefighters had to install additional braces the next day . Also that year , about 75 lights were stolen from the decorative Christmas trees set up around the candle 's base .

Easton officials declined to discuss the extent of the damage , but Henry Schultz dismissed the vandals as \" kids \" . In 1974 , the Peace Candle was only lit a few hours a night , and not at all on some nights , due to an ongoing energy crisis , which prompted the Metropolitan Edison Company to ask its Easton area customers not to use Christmas lights that year .

Additionally the committee spent $ 1 @,@ 700 in Peace Candle Christmas cards meant to bring in donations , but only 500 packs were sold at $ 1 each .

Even though they comprised 40 % of the total main ammunition load by 1944 , 3 Shiki tsûjôdan were rarely used in combat against enemy aircraft due to the severe damage the firing of these shells inflicted on the barrels of the main guns ; indeed , one of the shells may have exploded early and disabled one of Musashi 's guns during the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea .

  "Hakluyt 's patrilineal ancestors were of Welsh extraction , rather than Dutch as is often suggested ; they appear to have settled in Herefordshire in England around the 13th century , and , according to antiquary John Leland , took their surname from the \" Forest of Cluid in Randnorland \" .

  "Xenon and the other noble gases were for a long time considered to be completely chemically inert and not able to form compounds . However , while teaching at the University of British Columbia , Neil Bartlett discovered that the gas platinum hexafluoride ( PtF6 ) was a powerful oxidizing agent that could oxidize oxygen gas ( O2 ) to form dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate ( O2 + [ PtF6 ] − ) . Since O2 and xenon have almost the same first ionization potential , Bartlett realized that platinum hexafluoride might also be able to oxidize xenon . On March 23 , 1962 , he mixed the two gases and produced the first known compound of a noble gas , xenon hexafluoroplatinate . Bartlett thought its composition to be Xe + [ PtF6 ] − , although later work has revealed that it was probably a mixture of various xenon @-@ containing salts .

  "\" Big Gay Al 's Big Gay Boat Ride \" explores the central theme of homosexuality , particularly through the gay characters Sparky and Big Gay Al , who would go on to play a more prominent role in the fifth season episode , \" Cripple Fight \" . The episode encourages tolerance of homosexuality , with protagonist Stan initially displaying anger and dismay upon learning that his dog is gay , but eventually learning to accept homosexuality and concluding that we should accept others for who they are . Big Gay Al displays several exaggerated gay stereotypes , including his lisping voice and flamboyant wardrobe , which includes an ascot tie .

  "McClintock was widely credited for discovering transposition after other researchers finally discovered the process in bacteria , yeast , and bacteriophages in the late 1960s and early 1970s . During this period , molecular biology had developed significant new technology , and scientists were able to show the molecular basis for transposition . In the 1970s , Ac and Ds were cloned by other scientists and were shown to be Class II transposons . Ac is a complete transposon that can produce a functional transposase , which is required for the element to move within the genome . Ds has a mutation in its transposase gene , which means that it cannot move without another source of transposase . Thus , as McClintock observed , Ds cannot move in the absence of Ac . Spm has also been characterized as a transposon . Subsequent research has shown that transposons typically do not move unless the cell is placed under stress , such as by irradiation or the breakage @-@ fusion @-@ bridge cycle , and thus their activation during stress can serve as a source of genetic variation for evolution . McClintock understood the role of transposons in evolution and genome change well before other researchers grasped the concept .

  "The reforms enacted by famed headmaster Thomas Arnold made Rugby the crucible of muscular Christianity , a \" cult of athleticism \" into which Wills was inculcated . Wills took up cricket within a week of entering Evans House . At first he bowled underhand , but it was considered outdated , so he tried roundarm bowling . He clean bowled a batsman with his first ball using this style and declared : \" I felt I was a bowler . \" Wills soon topped all of his house 's cricket statistics . At bat he was a \" punisher \" with a sound defence ; however , in an era when graceful stroke @-@ play was expected of a gentleman cricketer , he was deemed to have no style at all . In April 1852 , aged sixteen , Wills joined the Rugby School XI , and on his debut at Lord 's a few months later , against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) , he took a match @-@ high 12 wickets . That year he formed one half of a bowling attack that established Rugby as the greatest public school in English cricket . In a prelude to his colonial career , he was accused of throwing by critics in the national media . Rugby coach John Lillywhite , himself a key campaigner against throwing , defended his protégé . Wills survived the scandal . He won fame for his performances and played with the leading cricketers of the age , as well as royalty . William Clarke , his hero , invited him to join the touring All @-@ England Eleven , but he remained at Rugby .

  "From about the age of nine until her marriage , Mary wrote passionate letters to an older girl , Frances Apsley , the daughter of courtier Sir Allen Apsley . In time , Frances became uncomfortable with the correspondence , and replied more formally . At the age of fifteen , Mary became betrothed to her cousin , the Protestant Stadtholder of Holland , William of Orange . William was the son of the King 's late sister , Mary , Princess Royal , and thus fourth in the line of succession after James , Mary , and Anne . At first , Charles II opposed the alliance with the Dutch ruler — he preferred that Mary wed the heir to the French throne , the Dauphin Louis , thus allying his realms with Catholic France and strengthening the odds of an eventual Catholic successor in Britain ; but later , under pressure from Parliament and with a coalition with the Catholic French no longer politically favourable , he approved the proposed union . The Duke of York agreed to the marriage , after pressure from chief minister Lord Danby and the King , who incorrectly assumed that it would improve James 's popularity among Protestants . When James told Mary that she was to marry her cousin , \" she wept all that afternoon and all the following day \" .",

He intimated that upon the Grand Prince 's death the Tuscans would rebel against Cosimo 's autocratic government . Cosimo , in an act of desperation , had Francesco Maria , the Medici family cardinal , renounce his religious vows and marry Eleanor of Gonzaga , the youngest child of the incumbent Duke of Guastalla .

  "In late June 1867 Betances and at least 12 more potential \" revolutionaries \" were exiled from Puerto Rico by then governor Gen. José María Marchessi y Oleaga as a preventive measure , including Goyco and Ruiz . A battalion of local soldiers had revolted in San Juan earlier , protesting about their poor pay , compared to that of their Spanish counterparts living in Puerto Rico . Betances later stated that the revolt ( called the \" Motín de Artilleros \" by historians ) was unrelated to his revolutionary plans , and that he actually did not mind the troops stationed in Puerto Rico that much , since they would have been ill @-@ prepared for stopping a well @-@ developed pro @-@ independence revolt at the time anyway . Marchesi feared that the United States , which had made an offer to purchase what were then the Danish Virgin Islands , would rather instigate a revolt in Puerto Rico so as to later annex the island — which would make a better military base in the Caribbean — at a lesser economic cost . His fears were not without base , since the then American consul in the island , Alexander Jourdan , suggested precisely this to then Secretary of State William H. Seward , but only after the expulsions ( September 1867 ) .",
  "Winch launches are much cheaper than aerotows , permit a higher take off frequency and have the advantage that many members of a club can be taught to operate the equipment . A winch may also be used at sites where an aerotow could not operate , because of the shape of the field or because of noise restrictions . The height gained from a winch is usually less than from an aerotow so pilots need to find a source of lift soon after releasing from the cable , otherwise the flight will be short . A break in the cable or the weak link during a winch launch is a possibility for which pilots are trained .",

However , more than a year later , on September 7 , 2005 , the conviction was overturned by the Maryland Court of Appeals and Logan was awarded a second trial . The judiciary determined that the investigators had acted with impropriety in the process of obtaining of Logan 's confession to the murders by violating Logan 's Miranda rights , and by deliberately misleading him in order to obtain a confession . The court also determined that the judiciary 's selection process of jurors for the trial had not been rigorous enough and had thus been conducted improperly . Logan 's retrial began in June 2007 , with the prosecution unable to use Logan 's confession to present its case for conviction , for the judiciary had ruled that it had been obtained with impropriety . In the retrial , the prosecution used the same argument it had used in the original trial back in 2003 , arguing that Logan 's insanity defense was illegitimate due to his usage of illegal controlled substances . The state 's prosecution argued that Logan himself was solely responsible for any deficiencies in his mental health , saying that they were brought about through his consumption of illegal narcotics , such as cocaine and marijuana , two illegal controlled substances which he had used on the day of the murders .

  "In the 1970s , as the feminist movements were forming , they began to affect the literature surrounding women in China . Studies on Chinese women from this period were concerned with women ’ s liberation , and were sympathetic to the feminist movement . This sentiment largely influenced the topics and methodology of the research . With this shift in perspective , the focus of discourse remained on subordination , patriarchal oppression , and victimization . These studies examined such issues as foot binding and the chastity of widows . Literature formulated by feminist writers did nothing to dispel the myth of the weak , subservient woman . These works provided a new bias that had not before been articulated . Feminists believed that Chinese women were a part of a “ universally subordinated womanhood \" . This line of thinking illustrates the cultural superiority inherently felt by Western women . Writings on Chinese woman rarely account for differences in time , ethnicity , class , region or age , preferring to describe the status of women as a static , unitary fixture of Chinese culture , despite the political and geographic boundaries that defined different regions and the economic and social changes that occurred throughout history .",

Rhys has described the song as quite a departure for him as a lyric writer and claimed that out of context it could appear bleak and scary . \" Presidential Suite \" , about former United States and Russian presidents Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin , is \" a reflective look back at the decadent nineties \" during the Lewinsky scandal and asks if \" we need to know if he really came inside her mouth ? \" . \" Juxtapozed with U \" addresses social injustice and is about \" house prices going up , and people being left behind by the super rich \" and has been described by Rhys as \" grotesque in its upness and lift \" . \" Sidewalk Serfer Girl \" was initially written about Patti White Bull , a girl who fell into a coma for 15 years , awaking in 1999 , but became an amalgamation of the lyrics of several different songs , including one section in which Rhys describes his disdain for extreme sports . \" Receptacle for the Respectable \" is about simultaneously being in awe of , and being hurt by , a \" girl around town \" while \" It 's Not the End of the World ? \" is \" a romantic song about growing old \" . \" Run !

  "\" The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace \" was written by John Swartzwelder , who had a deal with the producers of the show to write five scripts for season ten . Although he was the one who wrote the episode , Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it . Greaney based Homer 's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life , he would badger and bore people with details of it . \" Homer 's relationship to Thomas Edison 's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy , \" Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode . The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney 's ; while working on the episode , he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards . He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer . Soon after coming up with the story , Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script . Greaney said \" it couldn 't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if I had written it . \"",
  "The origins of Fabian were from a tropical wave and a cold front that entered the northwestern Caribbean Sea on October 12 . The two systems interacted in the Gulf of Honduras , producing convection and low atmospheric pressures . An anticyclone developed over the system , which aided in the organization of the thunderstorms . At 1300 UTC on October 15 , a Hurricane Hunters flight observed sustained winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) to the southwest of the Isle of Youth . Based on the report , the system was classified as Tropical Storm Fabian . Its development was typical for an October storm in the western Caribbean . With a high pressure area to the north , there was already a large pressure gradient that had produced tropical storm force winds over the area . By the time Fabian developed a circulation , it was able to be classified as a tropical storm . However , it is possible it was a tropical depression for about 12 hours before the Hurricane Hunters report .",

  "While most ants have poor eyesight , Myrmecia ants have excellent vision . This trait is important to them , since Myrmecia primarily relies on visual cues for navigation . These ants are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away . Winged alates are only active during the day , as they can see better . Members of a colony have different eye structures due to each individual fulfilling different tasks , and nocturnal species have larger ommatidia in comparison to those that are active during the day . Facet lenses also vary in size ; for example , the diurnal species M. croslandi has a smaller lens in comparison to M. nigriceps and M. pyriformis which have larger lenses . Myrmecia ants have three photoreceptors that can see UV light , meaning they are capable of seeing colours that humans cannot . Their vision is said to be better than some mammals , such as cats , dogs or wallabies . Despite their excellent vision , worker ants of this genus find it difficult to find their nests at night , due to the difficulty of finding the landmarks they use to navigate . They are thus more likely to return to their nests the following morning , walking slowly with long pauses .",

  "In the 1980s manufacturers such as Hummel and Adidas began to design shirts with increasingly intricate designs , as new technology led to the introduction of such design elements as shadow prints and pinstripes . Hummel 's distinctive halved strip designed for the Danish national team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup caused a stir in the media but FIFA worried about moiré artefacts in television pictures . Shorts became shorter than ever during the 1970s and 1980s , and often included the player 's number on the front . In the 1991 FA Cup Final Tottenham Hotspur 's players lined up in long baggy shorts . Although , the new look was derided , clubs in Britain and elsewhere had within a short time adopted the longer shorts . In the 1990s shirt designs became increasingly complex , with many teams sporting extremely gaudy colour schemes . Design decisions were increasingly driven by the need for the shirt to look good when worn by fans as a fashion item , but many designs from this era have since come to be regarded as amongst the worst of all time . In 1996 , Manchester United notoriously introduced a grey strip which had been specifically designed to look good when worn with jeans , but abandoned it halfway through a match after manager Alex Ferguson claimed that the reason why his team was losing 3 – 0 was that the players could not see each other on the pitch . United switched to different colours for the second half and scored one goal without reply . The leading leagues also introduced squad numbers , whereby each player is allocated a specific number for the duration of a season .

  "By contrast , Jörg Haider 's assumption of party leadership in 1986 was considered a triumph by the German nationalist faction . However , Haider 's right @-@ wing populism did not stress pan @-@ Germanist traditions , as doing so would have cost votes . In 1987 , only six percent of Austrian citizens identified themselves as \" Germans \" . While Haider had branded Austrian national identity as an ideological construct , going so far to refer to it as a \" monstrosity \" ( German : Mißgeburt ) in 1988 , he launched the \" Austria First \" petition in 1993 , and claimed two years later that the Freedom Party was a \" classical Austrian patriotic party \" , expressly renouncing his earlier \" monstrosity \" statement . The influence of German nationalism was still present , however , and could be seen in hostile actions against Slavic minorities in Austria , such as in conflicts over bilingual road sign with the Carinthian Slovenes , along with hostility to immigration and European integration . Traditional Greater German ideas have therefore been replaced by a German @-@ Austrian concept ( i.e. only considering Austrians of German origin and tongue as \" real \" Austrians ) . This may be summarised as an \" amalgamation of traditional German nationalism with Austrian patriotism \" .",

  "Malaria parasites belong to the genus Plasmodium ( phylum Apicomplexa ) . In humans , malaria is caused by P. falciparum , P. malariae , P. ovale , P. vivax and P. knowlesi . Among those infected , P. falciparum is the most common species identified ( ~ 75 % ) followed by P. vivax ( ~ 20 % ) . Although P. falciparum traditionally accounts for the majority of deaths , recent evidence suggests that P. vivax malaria is associated with potentially life @-@ threatening conditions about as often as with a diagnosis of P. falciparum infection . P. vivax proportionally is more common outside Africa .

  "Ruddigore followed The Mikado at the Savoy in 1887 . It was profitable , but its nine @-@ month run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier Savoy operas . For their next piece , Gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot ; Sullivan immediately rejected it . Gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera , to which Sullivan agreed . Although it was not a grand opera , The Yeomen of the Guard ( 1888 ) provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date . As early as 1883 , Sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera . In 1885 , he told an interviewer , \" \" The opera of the future is a compromise [ among the French , German and Italian schools ] – a sort of eclectic school , a selection of the merits of each one .

  "Game had begun to become scarce in the region east of the Mississippi river . This could have been from over @-@ hunting , or the game could have been driven westward as the colonial population increased . Fortunately , Irish and Scottish immigrants had been importing cattle into the American colonies during the early part of the 18th century .

This change increased farmers ' profit from animal husbandry . Cattle raising had begun on a small scale during the French @-@ Indian War , but when the American Revolution came , farmers were able to increase their cattle holdings and increase the presence of beef in the American diet .

  "During its period of migration , Neptune is thought to have captured a large KBO , Triton , which is the only large moon in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit ( it orbits opposite to Neptune 's rotation ) . This suggests that , unlike the large moons of Jupiter , Saturn , and Uranus , which are thought to have coalesced from rotating discs of material around their young parent planets , Triton was a fully formed body that was captured from surrounding space . Gravitational capture of an object is not easy : it requires some mechanism to slow down the object enough to be caught by the larger object 's gravity . A possible explanation is that Triton was part of a binary when it encountered Neptune . ( Many KBOs are members of binaries . See below . ) Ejection of the other member of the binary by Neptune could then explain Triton 's capture . Triton is only 14 % larger than Pluto , and spectral analysis of both worlds shows that their surfaces are largely composed of similar materials , such as methane and carbon monoxide . All this points to the conclusion that Triton was once a KBO that was captured by Neptune during its outward migration .",

  "The Dorset Ooser was first brought to public attention in 1891 , at which time it was under the ownership of the Cave family of Melbury Osmond 's Holt Farm . After traveling with Edward Cave to Somerset , the Ooser went missing around 1897 . Since then , various folklorists and historians have debated the origins of the head , which has possible connections to the horned costumes sometimes worn by participants in English Mummers plays . The folklorists Frederick Thomas Elworthy and H. S. L.

  "Regarding the structure of Chaplin 's films , the scholar Gerald Mast sees them as consisting of sketches tied together by the same theme and setting , rather than having a tightly unified storyline . Visually , his films are simple and economic , with scenes portrayed as if set on a stage . His approach to filming was described by the art director Eugène Lourié : \" Chaplin did not think in ' artistic ' images when he was shooting . He believed that action is the main thing . The camera is there to photograph the actors \" . In his autobiography , Chaplin wrote , \" Simplicity is best ... pompous effects slow up action , are boring and unpleasant ... The camera should not intrude . \" This approach has prompted criticism , since the 1940s , for being \" old fashioned \" , while the film scholar Donald McCaffrey sees it as an indication that Chaplin never completely understood film as a medium . Kamin , however , comments that Chaplin 's comedic talent would not be enough to remain funny on screen if he did not have an \" ability to conceive and direct scenes specifically for the film medium \" .",

  "Busoni was an outstanding ( if sometimes controversial ) pianist from an early age . He began composing in his early years in a late romantic style , but after 1907 , when he published his Sketch of a New Esthetic of Music , he developed a more individual style , often with elements of atonality . His visits to America led to interest in North American indigenous tribal melodies which were reflected in some of his works . His compositions include works for piano , including a monumental Piano Concerto , and transcriptions of the works of others , notably Johann Sebastian Bach which appeared in the Bach @-@ Busoni Edition . His other compositions include chamber music , vocal and orchestral works , and also operas , one of which , Doktor Faust , was left unfinished at the time of his death .

  "The Northumbrian king , Æthelred , was assassinated in April 796 , and less than a month later his successor , Osbald , was deposed in favour of Eardwulf . Eardwulf had Alhmund killed in 800 ; Alhmund was the son of King Alhred of Northumbria , who had reigned from 765 to 774 . Alhmund 's death was regarded as a martyrdom , and his cult subsequently developed at Derby , in Mercian territory , perhaps implying Mercian involvement in Northumbrian politics at the time . Coenwulf gave hospitality to Eardwulf 's enemies , who had been exiled from Northumbria , and consequently Eardwulf invaded Mercia in 801 . The invasion was inconclusive , however , and peace was arranged on equal terms . Coenwulf may also have been behind the coup in 806 that led to Eardwulf losing his throne , and he likely continued to support Eardwulf 's enemies after Eardwulf returned in 808 .",

  "Critics commented on Zakaria 's teleological point @-@ of @-@ view . In a review published in The Progressive , Johann Hari called Zakaria 's assertions Thatcherist referring to the belief that there is no alternative to globalization and free market capitalism . Hari cited examples where policies such as what Zakaria advocated led to disasters , like the 1999 collapse of Argentinian economy , and financial deregulation resulting in the financial crisis of 2007 – 2010 , which had begun just after the book was published . In the book , Zakaria maintains that economic dysfunctions are caused by , and can be solved through , specific government policies . When asked , in February 2009 , about the financial crisis , Zakaria asserted that the financial practices that created the collapse were American practices , and that it contributed to the post @-@ American mentality that the US does not have all of the answers .

  "Piccadilly was named Portugal Street in 1663 after Catherine of Braganza , wife of Charles II . Its importance to traffic increased after an earlier road from Charing Cross to Hyde Park Corner was closed to allow the creation of Green Park in 1668 . After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660 , Charles II encouraged the development of Portugal Street and the area to the north ( Mayfair ) and they became fashionable residential localities . Some of the grandest mansions in London were built on the northern side of the street . Edward Hyde , 1st Earl of Clarendon and close political adviser to the king , purchased land for a house ; Clarendon House ( now the location of Albemarle Street ) was built in 1664 , and the earl sold the surplus land partly to Sir John Denham , who built what later became Burlington House . Denham chose the location because it was on the outskirts of London surrounded by fields . The house was first used to house the poor , before being reconstructed by the third Earl of Burlington in 1718 . Berkeley House was constructed around the same time as Clarendon House . It was destroyed by a fire in 1733 and rebuilt as Devonshire House in 1737 by William Cavendish , 3rd Duke of Devonshire , and was subsequently used as the headquarters for the Whig party . Devonshire House survived until 1921 , before being sold for redevelopment by Edward Cavendish , 10th Duke of Devonshire for £ 1 million .

The DNA sequence data of Hanson and colleagues supported a deep separation between the palustris and couesi groups , but a Costa Rican sample ( assigned to O. couesi ) was about as distant from the two groups as they were from each other .",

  "Mauna Loa is slumping eastward along its southwestern rift zone , leveraging its mass into Kīlauea and driving the latter eastward at a rate of about 10 cm ( 4 in ) per year ; the interaction between the two volcanoes in this manner has generated a number of large earthquakes in the past , and has resulted in a significant area of debris off of Kīlauea 's seaward flank known as the Hilina Slump .

  "Giant impacts are thought to have been common in the early Solar System .

  "In 2012 , the station had a free car park with 120 spaces , but this was frequently full by 7 : 30am on weekdays , leading commuters to park on local roads , prompting complaints from Backwell residents . Plans to extend the car park by 200 spaces were drawn up in 2009 , with North Somerset Council describing the scheme as \" necessary \" , as the lack of spaces limited the number of people who could feasibly use the station for commuting due to Nailsea being too far from the station to be an easy walk , causing people to drive to the station . That peak passengers filled the car park then meant there are no spaces for offpeak users , limiting leisure travel . North Somerset Council approved the construction of the extension on 17 April 2012 , and further approved the car park becoming pay and display - all car parks in Nailsea had previously been free .

  "Harrison used Campbell 's image filter theory , which was the most advanced filter theory available at the time . In this theory , filter design is viewed essentially as an impedance matching problem . More advanced filter theory was brought to bear on this problem by Norton in 1929 at Bell Labs . Norton followed the same general approach though he later described to Darlington the filter he designed as being \" maximally flat \" . Norton 's mechanical design predates the paper by Butterworth who is usually credited as the first to describe the electronic maximally flat filter . The equations Norton gives for his filter correspond to a singly terminated Butterworth filter , that is , one driven by an ideal voltage source with no impedance , whereas the form more usually given in texts is for the doubly terminated filter with resistors at both ends , making it hard to recognise the design for what it is . Another unusual feature of Norton 's filter design arises from the series capacitor , which represents the stiffness of the diaphragm . This is the only series capacitor in Norton 's representation , and without it , the filter could be analysed as a low @-@ pass prototype . Norton moves the capacitor out of the body of the filter to the input at the expense of introducing a transformer into the equivalent circuit ( Norton 's figure 4 ) . Norton has used here the \" turning round the L \" impedance transform to achieve this .",

  "The second early stone design , emerging from the 12th century onwards , was the shell keep , a donjon annulaire in French , which involved replacing the wooden keep on a motte , or the palisade on a ringwork , with a circular stone wall . Shell keeps were sometimes further protected by an additional low protective wall , called a chemise , around their base . Buildings could then be built around the inside of the shell , producing a small inner courtyard at the centre . The style was particularly popular in south @-@ east England and across Normandy , although less so elsewhere . Restormel Castle is a classic example of this development , as is the later Launceston Castle ; prominent Normandy and Low Country equivalents include Gisors and the Burcht van Leiden – these castles were amongst the most powerful fortifications of the period . Although the circular design held military advantages over one with square corners , as noted above these really mattered from only the end of the 12th century onwards ; the major reason for adopting a shell keep design , in the 12th century at least , was the circular design of the original earthworks exploited to support the keep ; indeed , some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes , such as that found at Windsor Castle .",

  "This species was first described in 1766 by Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth edition of his Systema Naturae as Turdus migratorius . The binomial name derives from two Latin words : turdus , \" thrush \" , and migratorius from migrare \" to go \" . The term robin for this species has been recorded since at least 1703 . There are about 65 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus Turdus , characterized by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs . A study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene indicates that the American robin is not part of the Central / South American clade of Turdus thrushes ; instead it shows genetic similarities to the Kurrichane thrush , T. libonyanus , and the olive thrush , T. olivaceus , both African species .

Most members of these two groups are easily recognizable as cacti . They have fleshy succulent stems that are major organs of photosynthesis . They have absent , small , or transient leaves . They have flowers with ovaries that lie below the sepals and petals , often deeply sunken into a fleshy receptacle ( the part of the stem from which the flower parts grow ) . All cacti have areoles — highly specialized short shoots with extremely short internodes that produce spines , normal shoots , and flowers .",
  "Most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders . Typically , prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site , the males usually arriving first , calling and setting up territories . Other satellite males remain quietly nearby , waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory . The females arrive sporadically , mate selection takes place and eggs are laid . The females depart and territories may change hands . More females appear and in due course , the breeding season comes to an end . Explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall . These frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site . They are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place , perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season . The assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues , the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females .",

  "Bax 's tone poems are in a variety of styles and have varied sharply in their popularity . His impressionistic tone poems In the Faëry Hills and the Debussy ' La Mer ' like Nympholept are described by Grove as \" a succinct and attractive pieces \" . The former was modestly successful , but Spring Fire and Nympholept ( 1913 ) instanced by Foreman as difficult works ; were not performed in Bax 's lifetime . During the First World War Bax wrote three tone poems , two of which – The Garden of Fand ( 1913 – 16 ) and November Woods ( 1917 ) – have remained on the fringes of the modern repertoire , and a third – Tintagel ( 1917 – 19 ) – which in the decade after his death was the only work by which Bax was known to the public . Grove characterises all three as musical evocations of nature , with little expression of subjective personal response . The orchestral piece that was neglected longest was In memoriam ( 1917 ) , a lament for Patrick Pearse , who was shot for his part in the Easter rising ; the work was not played until 1998 . Bax reused the main melody for his incidental music to Oliver Twist ( 1948 ) .",

  "Stanley , as Port Jackson was soon renamed , officially became the seat of government in 1845 . Early in its history , Stanley had a negative reputation due to cargo @-@ shipping losses ; only in emergencies would ships rounding Cape Horn stop at the port . Nevertheless , the Falklands ' geographic location proved ideal for ship repairs and the \" Wrecking Trade \" , the business of selling and buying shipwrecks and their cargoes . Aside from this trade , commercial interest in the archipelago was minimal due to the low @-@ value hides of the feral cattle roaming the pastures . Economic growth began only after the Falkland Islands Company , which bought out Lafone 's failing enterprise in 1851 , successfully introduced Cheviot sheep for wool farming , spurring other farms to follow suit . The high cost of importing materials , combined with the shortage of labour and consequent high wages , meant the ship repair trade became uncompetitive . After 1870 , it declined as the replacement of sail ships by steamships was accelerated by the low cost of coal in South America ; by 1914 , with the opening of the Panama Canal , the trade effectively ended . In 1881 , the Falkland Islands became financially independent of Britain . For more than a century , the Falkland Islands Company dominated the trade and employment of the archipelago ; in addition , it owned most housing in Stanley , which greatly benefited from the wool trade with the UK .",

Yet , in 1405 James was under the protection and tutelage of Bishop Henry Wardlaw of St Andrews on the country 's east coast . Douglas animosity was intensifying because of the activities of Orkney and Fleming who continued to expand their involvement in border politics and foreign relations with England . Although a decision to send the young prince to France and out of Albany 's reach was taken in the winter of 1405 – 06 , James 's departure from Scotland was unplanned . In February 1406 Bishop Wardlaw released James to Orkney and Fleming who , with their large force of Lothian adherents , proceeded into hostile Douglas east Lothian . James 's custodians may have been giving a demonstration of royal approval to further their interests in Douglas country . This provoked a fierce response from James Douglas of Balvenie and his supporters who , at a place called Long Hermiston Muir , engaged with and killed Fleming while Orkney and James escaped to the comparative safety of the Bass Rock islet in the Firth of Forth .

  "An example of the chronicle 's bias against the descendants of Rögnvaldr Guðrøðarson is one of the two miracle narratives preserved by this source . The story in question is about a miracle attributed to St Mary , which may have been incorporated into the chronicle in order to discredit the reign of Haraldr Guðrøðarson . Whatever the case , the story deals with an aged chieftain named Domnall , who is described as a close friend of Haraldr Óláfsson , and regarded by the latter as worthier than others .

The latter , however , is stated to have tricked them into leaving the church @-@ grounds , whereupon they were immediately seized . It was in this time of need , so the story says , that Domnall 's prayers to St Mary were answered , and that it was through her divine intervention that he and his son escaped from their imprisonment .

  "In economic and environmental fields , the term decoupling is becoming increasingly used in the context of economic production and environmental quality . When used in this way , it refers to the ability of an economy to grow without incurring corresponding increases in environmental pressure . Ecological economics includes the study of societal metabolism , the throughput of resources that enter and exit the economic system in relation to environmental quality . An economy that is able to sustain GDP growth without having a negative impact on the environment is said to be decoupled . Exactly how , if , or to what extent this can be achieved is a subject of much debate . In 2011 the International Resource Panel , hosted by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , warned that by 2050 the human race could be devouring 140 billion tons of minerals , ores , fossil fuels and biomass per year – three times its current rate of consumption – unless nations can make serious attempts at decoupling . The report noted that citizens of developed countries consume an average of 16 tons of those four key resources per capita per annum ( ranging up to 40 or more tons per person in some developed countries ) . By comparison , the average person in India today consumes four tons per year .

  "In the article \" Who is Afraid of Edward Said ? \" , Biswamoy Pati said that in establishing ethnicity and cultural background as tests of authority and objectivity in studying the Orient , Edward Said drew attention to his own ethnic and cultural identities as a Palestinian man and as a colonial Subaltern from the Mandate of Palestine , the British Middle East . In the article \" Orients and Occidents : Colonial Discourse Theory and the Historiography of the British Empire \" , D. A. Washbrook said that Said 's Anglophone education ( British and American ) disqualified him from writing about the Orient by virtue of his own arguments in Orientalism ; Said had lived most of his adult life in the U.S. as a university professor , but argued that : \" any and all representations ... are embedded , first , in the language , and then in the culture , institutions , and political ambience of the representer ... [ and are ] interwoven with a great many other things besides ' The Truth ' , which is , itself , a representation \" . That excessive cultural relativism had trapped the academic Said , and his post @-@ colonial theorist followers , in a \" web of solipsism \" , which limits him and them to speak only of cultural \" representations \" , whilst simultaneously allowing Said and cohort to deny the existence of any objective truth about the Orient .",

  "The 1955 Freedom Charter , which Mandela had helped create , called for the nationalisation of banks , gold mines and land , believing this necessary to ensure equal distribution of wealth . Despite these beliefs , Mandela initiated a programme of privatisation during his presidency in line with trends in other countries of the time . It has been repeatedly suggested that Mandela would have preferred to develop a social democratic economy in South Africa but that this was not feasible as a result of the international political and economic situation during the early 1990s . This decision was in part influenced by the fall of the socialist states in the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc during the early 1990s . In contrast , China was developing rapidly within a \" socialist market economy \" and Mandela began to quote Deng Xiaoping 's aphorism , \" It doesn 't matter whether a cat is black or white , so long as it catches mice . \"",

Norwich Cathedral was built immediately to the east of Tombland and much of the old town to the southwest of Tombland was cleared for the motte of Norwich Castle . A new Norman town was built west of the Castle , in an area known as Mancroft .

The exact date of the foundation of the market at Mancroft is not recorded , but it is known to have been operational by the time the Domesday Book was compiled in 1086 . Granting the right to trade in Norman England was a part of the Royal Prerogative and , as with most fairs and markets of the period , the market at Mancroft was operated under licence from the King . The King 's Clerk had jurisdiction over all trade conducted at the market , and tolls and rents were collected on behalf of the King .",

  "Meanwhile , at the UN , although the UN members and US were initially divided on how to respond to Chinese intervention in Korea , the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire soon rallied the UN members towards US . Immediately afterward , a UN resolution that condemned China as an aggressor was passed on February 1 . In the opinion of historian Bevin Alexander , the Chinese rejection of UN ceasefire had damaged the international prestige it had built from its earlier military successes , and this later made it difficult for China to either join the UN or to deny US support for Taiwan . The Korean War , which ultimately ended at the 38th parallel , would drag on for another two bloody years due to the Chinese demand for all UN forces to be withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula .",

An even greater influence was Schumann , whose piano music Fauré loved more than any other . The authors of The Record Guide ( 1955 ) wrote that Fauré learnt restraint and beauty of surface from Mozart , tonal freedom and long melodic lines from Chopin , \" and from Schumann , the sudden felicities in which his development sections abound , and those codas in which whole movements are briefly but magically illuminated . \" When Fauré was a student at the École Niedermeyer his tutor had introduced him to new concepts of harmony , no longer outlawing certain chords as \" dissonant \" .
