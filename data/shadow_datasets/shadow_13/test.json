  "Born in Boston , Adams was brought up in a religious and politically active family . A graduate of Harvard College , he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics . As an influential official of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Boston Town Meeting in the 1760s , Adams was a part of a movement opposed to the British Parliament 's efforts to tax the British American colonies without their consent . His 1768 Massachusetts Circular Letter calling for colonial non @-@ cooperation prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers , eventually resulting in the Boston Massacre of 1770 . To help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government 's attempts to violate the British Constitution at the expense of the colonies , in 1772 Adams and his colleagues devised a committee of correspondence system , which linked like @-@ minded Patriots throughout the Thirteen Colonies . Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 Boston Tea Party and the coming of the American Revolution .",

  "However , even following Romanum decet pontificem , only three of the eight Popes of the 18th century failed to make a nephew or brother cardinal . The College of Cardinals apparently preferred rule by nephews than by favorites , which they perceived as the alternative ; for example , the College urged Pope Benedict XIII ( 1724 – 1730 ) to appoint a cardinal @-@ nephew , who they hoped would replace Benedict XIII 's notorious lieutenant Niccolò Coscia . Pope Gregory XIII ( 1572 – 1585 ) also had to be urged by key figures in the College to appoint his cardinal @-@ nephew : Filippo Boncompagni .",

  "The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written , \" It is easy , because of the scope , stature , and sheer volume of the operas , and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds , to pay insufficient attention to the many works Britten wrote in other , specifically non @-@ vocal genres . \" Maw said of Britten , \" He is one of the 20th century 's great orchestral composers ... His orchestration has an individuality , incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers . \" Among Britten 's best @-@ known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge ( 1937 ) , the Sinfonia da Requiem ( 1940 ) , the Four Sea Interludes ( 1945 ) and The Young Person 's Guide to the Orchestra ( 1945 ) . The Variations , an affectionate tribute to Britten 's teacher , range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clichés and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march , reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe , and a Mahlerian funeral march ; the piece ends with an exuberant fugal finale . The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies Irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam , described by the critic Herbert Glass as \" the most uneasy ' eternal rest ' possible \" . Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure : \" less entertaining than usual , because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically . It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic \" . The Sea Interludes , adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes , make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set ; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between \" Dawn \" , \" Sunday Morning \" , \" Moonlight \" and \" Storm \" . The commentator Howard Posner observes that there is not a bar in the interludes , no matter how beautiful , that is free of foreboding . The Young Person 's Guide , based on a theme by Purcell , showcases the orchestra 's individual sections and groups , and gained widespread popularity from the outset . Christopher Headington calls the work \" exuberant and uncomplicated music , scored with clarity and vigour [ that ] fits well into Britten 's oeuvre . \" David Matthews calls it \" a brilliant educational exercise . \"",

  "Writing in ancient Egypt — both hieroglyphic and hieratic — first appeared in the late 4th millennium BC during the late phase of predynastic Egypt . By the Old Kingdom ( 26th century BC to 22nd century BC ) , literary works included funerary texts , epistles and letters , hymns and poems , and commemorative autobiographical texts recounting the careers of prominent administrative officials . It was not until the early Middle Kingdom ( 21st century BC to 17th century BC ) that a narrative Egyptian literature was created . This was a \" media revolution \" which , according to Richard B. Parkinson , was the result of the rise of an intellectual class of scribes , new cultural sensibilities about individuality , unprecedented levels of literacy , and mainstream access to written materials . However , it is possible that the overall literacy rate was less than one percent of the entire population . The creation of literature was thus an elite exercise , monopolized by a scribal class attached to government offices and the royal court of the ruling pharaoh . However , there is no full consensus among modern scholars concerning the dependence of ancient Egyptian literature on the sociopolitical order of the royal courts .",

  "Transcription produces a single @-@ stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA , whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA from which it was transcribed . The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product . The gene 's DNA is used as a template to generate a complementary mRNA . The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene 's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand . Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase , which reads the template strand in the 3 ' to 5 ' direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5 ' to 3 ' . To initiate transcription , the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene . Thus , a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region , either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase , or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible .",

  "Janáček was deeply influenced by folklore , and by Moravian folk music in particular , but not by the pervasive , idealized 19th century romantic folklore variant . He took a realistic , descriptive and analytic approach to the material . Moravian folk songs , compared with their Bohemian counterparts , are much freer and more irregular in their metrical and rhythmic structure , and more varied in their melodic intervals . In his study of Moravian modes , Janáček found that the peasant musicians did not know the names of the modes and had their own ways of referring to them . He considered their Moravian modulation , as he called it , a general characteristic of this region 's folk music .",

  "On 21 March 1816 , at the age of seven years , Mendelssohn was baptised with his brother and sisters in a home ceremony by Johann Jakob Stegemann , minister of the Evangelical congregation of Berlin 's Jerusalem Church and New Church . Although Mendelssohn was a conforming ( if not over @-@ zealous ) Christian as a member of the Reformed Church , he was both conscious and proud of his Jewish ancestry and notably of his connection with his grandfather Moses Mendelssohn . He was the prime mover in proposing to the publisher Heinrich Brockhaus a complete edition of Moses 's works , which continued with the support of his uncle Joseph Mendelssohn . Mendelssohn was notably reluctant , either in his letters or conversation , to comment on his innermost beliefs ; his friend Devrient wrote that \" [ his ] deep convictions were never uttered in intercourse with the world ; only in rare and intimate moments did they ever appear , and then only in the slightest and most humorous allusions \" . Thus for example in a letter to his sister Rebecka , Mendelssohn rebukes her complaint about an unpleasant relative : \" What do you mean by saying you are not hostile to Jews ? I hope this was a joke [ ... ] It is really sweet of you that you do not despise your family , isn 't it ? \" Some modern scholars have devoted considerable energy to demonstrate either that Mendelssohn was deeply sympathetic to his ancestors ' Jewish beliefs , or that he was hostile to this and sincere in his Christian beliefs .",

It minimizes its water loss by producing concentrated urine and dry dung , and is able to lose 40 % of its body weight through water loss without dying of dehydration . Carnivores can obtain much of their water needs from the body fluids of their prey . Many other hot desert animals are nocturnal , seeking out shade during the day or dwelling underground in burrows . At depths of more than 50 cm ( 20 in ) , these remain at between 30 to 32 ° C ( 86 to 90 ° F ) regardless of the external temperature . Jerboas , desert rats , kangaroo rats and other small rodents emerge from their burrows at night and so do the foxes , coyotes , jackals and snakes that prey on them . Kangaroos keep cool by increasing their respiration rate , panting , sweating and moistening the skin of their forelegs with saliva . Mammals living in cold deserts have developed greater insulation through warmer body fur and insulating layers of fat beneath the skin . The arctic weasel has a metabolic rate that is two or three times as high as would be expected for an animal of its size . Birds have avoided the problem of losing heat through their feet by not attempting to maintain them at the same temperature as the rest of their bodies , a form of adaptive insulation . The emperor penguin has dense plumage , a downy under layer , an air insulation layer next the skin and various thermoregulatory strategies to maintain its body temperature in one of the harshest environments on Earth .",

  "However , in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems , including the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini , who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister and director of the Berlin Hofoper . Complaints were made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable ( which finally took place in June 1832 ) , and Meyerbeer 's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab . There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer . Moreover , reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin , ( and indeed in many other cities of Germany ) . Nevertheless , Meyerbeer , who ( as he wrote to a friend ) ' years ago ... swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work , and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics ' , refused to be drawn on any of these matters .",
  "Around the turn of the 18th century , the chalumeau was modified by converting one of its keys into a register key to produce the first clarinet . This development is usually attributed to German instrument maker Johann Christoph Denner , though some have suggested his son Jacob Denner was the inventor . This instrument played well in the middle register with a loud , shrill sound , so it was given the name clarinetto meaning \" little trumpet \" ( from clarino + -etto ) . Early clarinets did not play well in the lower register , so players continued to play the chalumeaux for low notes . As clarinets improved , the chalumeau fell into disuse , and these notes became known as the chalumeau register . Original Denner clarinets had two keys , and could play a chromatic scale , but various makers added more keys to get improved tuning , easier fingerings , and a slightly larger range . The classical clarinet of Mozart 's day typically had eight finger holes and five keys .",

  "The range of a clarinet can be divided into three distinct registers . The lowest register , from low written E to the written B ♭ above middle C ( B ♭ 4 ) , is known as the chalumeau register ( named after the instrument that was the clarinet 's immediate predecessor ) . The middle register is known as the clarion register ( sometimes in the U.S.A. as the clarino register from the Italian ) and spans just over an octave ( from written B above middle C ( B4 ) to the C two octaves above middle C ( C6 ) ) ; it is the dominant range for most members of the clarinet family . The top or altissimo register consists of the notes above the written C two octaves above middle C ( C6 ) . All three registers have characteristically different sounds . The chalumeau register is rich and dark . The clarion register is brighter and sweet , like a trumpet ( clarion ) heard from afar . The altissimo register can be piercing and sometimes shrill .",

  "Aside from Æthelberht 's granting of freedom of worship to his wife , the choice of Kent was probably dictated by a number of other factors . Kent was the dominant power in southeastern Britain . Since the eclipse of King Ceawlin of Wessex in 592 , Æthelberht was the leading Anglo @-@ Saxon ruler ; Bede refers to Æthelberht as having imperium ( overlordship ) south of the River Humber . Trade between the Franks and Æthelberht 's kingdom was well established , and the language barrier between the two regions was apparently only a minor obstacle , as the interpreters for the mission came from the Franks . Lastly , Kent 's proximity to the Franks allowed support from a Christian area . There is some evidence , including Gregory 's letters to Frankish kings in support of the mission , that some of the Franks felt that they had a claim to overlordship over some of the southern British kingdoms at this time . The presence of a Frankish bishop could also have lent credence to claims of overlordship , if Bertha 's Bishop Liudhard was felt to be acting as a representative of the Frankish church and not merely as a spiritual advisor to the queen . Frankish influence was not merely political ; archaeological remains attest to a cultural influence as well .",

Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1 mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time . Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger , continuous areas of ulceration . Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring . The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized . Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful , and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers . Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous . It generally occurs in a slightly older age group than the other subtypes , and females are affected slightly more frequently than males .",

She reduced this to \" Noether 's problem \" , which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup G of the permutation group Sn acting on the field k ( x1 , ... , xn ) always is a pure transcendental extension of the field k . ( She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper , where she attributed the problem to her colleague Fischer . ) She showed this was true for n =",

  "Several factors including the presence of an elliptical building unique in legionary fortresses , the method of construction , and the unusual size of the fortress – 20 % larger than other Roman fortresses in Britain – suggest that it may have been intended as the base for a potential invasion of Ireland , and perhaps eventually to become the capital of the unified British Isles under Rome . The fortress contained barracks , granaries , military headquarters , military baths , and an unusual elliptical building that may have acted as the governor of Britain 's headquarters . The fortress was rebuilt in stone at the end of the 1st century AD when it was occupied by the Legio XX Valeria Victrix , and again in the early 3rd century . The legion probably remained at the fortress until it eventually fell into disuse in the late 4th or early 5th century .",

  "The series has also been criticized for its release model in contrast to the Rock Band series , causing some players to hold contempt towards Activision . Harmonix considered the Rock Band series as a \" music platform \" , and supported it with downloadable content and the ability to import songs from its games and expansions into most other games of the series .

  "Welding can be dangerous and unhealthy if the proper precautions are not taken . However , using new technology and proper protection greatly reduces risks of injury and death associated with welding . Since many common welding procedures involve an open electric arc or flame , the risk of burns and fire is significant ; this is why it is classified as a hot work process . To prevent injury , welders wear personal protective equipment in the form of heavy leather gloves and protective long @-@ sleeve jackets to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames . Additionally , the brightness of the weld area leads to a condition called arc eye or flash burns in which ultraviolet light causes inflammation of the cornea and can burn the retinas of the eyes . Goggles and welding helmets with dark UV @-@ filtering face plates are worn to prevent this exposure . Since the 2000s , some helmets have included a face plate which instantly darkens upon exposure to the intense UV light .

She did sing a version of \" Go Down Moses \" to signal to her refugees along the path to freedom — she changed the tempo to indicate that it was either safe or too dangerous to proceed . Like other Underground Railroad conductors , Tubman used various methods of communication specific to her own needs .

  "By the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit : the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle ( or Northern Hound ) . The Southern Hound , a tall , heavy dog with a square head , and long , soft ears , was common from south of the River Trent and probably closely related to the Talbot Hound . Though slow , it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability . The North Country Beagle , possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound , was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties . It was smaller than the Southern Hound , less heavy @-@ set and with a more pointed muzzle . It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed . As fox hunting became increasingly popular , numbers of both types of hound diminished . The beagle @-@ type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern Foxhound . The beagle @-@ size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit @-@ hunting packs .",

  "Xenogears was Yasunori Mitsuda 's first major solo work , as his previous soundtracks were collaborations with other composers with the exception of the score to Radical Dreamers : Nusumenai Hōseki , which never saw an album release . According to Mitsuda , the music of Xenogears belongs to the traditional music genre . Though he first described it as stemming from \" a world of [ his ] own imagining \" rather than any specific country , he has also claimed a strong Irish or Celtic music influence . His musical approach for the original soundtrack was to insert Celtic influences into \" easy @-@ to @-@ listen @-@ to \" pop tracks rather than making either \" dense \" Celtic music or simple background music . For Creid , he expanded on this theme to create an album of arranged Xenogears music with a more prominent Celtic style . The album contains a mixture of vocal and instrumental tracks , and combines Japanese and Celtic music together in its pieces . The album 's title refers to two ideas , with one being \" a message to those who feel they have lost sight of their ambitions for the flood of information this era surrounds us with \" and the other an affirmation to himself that Mitsuda had \" rediscovered [ his ] own path \" . Mitsuda felt that with this album , he had \" discovered the precise mode of musical expression [ he ] was seeking within \" himself and \" given form to the belief within [ his ] heart \" .",

  "McKinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics . In 1880 , he served a brief term as Ohio 's representative on the Republican National Committee . In 1884 , he was elected a delegate to that year 's Republican convention , where he served as chair of the Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside . By 1886 , McKinley , Senator John Sherman , and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio . Sherman , who had helped to found the Republican Party , ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s , each time failing , while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade .

The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention , where McKinley , Foraker , and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman .

When Blaine stated he was not a candidate , Foraker returned to Sherman , but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison , who was elected president . In the bitterness that followed the convention , Hanna abandoned Foraker , and for the rest of McKinley 's life , the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions , one aligned with McKinley , Sherman , and Hanna and the other with Foraker .

  "Owing to a decline in population and lack of interest in the mail contract , the GPO ended its presence on Lundy at the end of 1927 . For the next two years Harman handled the mail to and from the island without charge . On 1 November 1929 , he decided to offset the expense by issuing two postage stamps ( ½ puffin in pink and 1 puffin in blue ) . One puffin is equivalent to one English penny . The printing of Puffin stamps continues to this day and they are available at face value from the Lundy Post Office .

The face value of the Lundy Island stamps covers the cost of postage of letters and postcards from the island to the Bideford Post Office on the mainland for onward delivery to their final destination anywhere in the world . The Lundy Post Office gets a bulk rate discount for mailing letters and postcards from Bideford .

Issues of increasing value were made over the years , including air mail , featuring a variety of people . Many are now highly sought @-@ after by collectors . The market value of the early issues has risen substantially over the years .

  "Pip , a chipmunk who can talk in the 2D world of Andalasia , loses his ability to communicate through speech in the real world so he must rely heavily on facial and body gestures . This meant the animators had to display Pip 's emotions through performance as well as making him appear like a real chipmunk . The team at Tippett began the process of animating Pip by observing live chipmunks which were filmed in motion from \" every conceivable angle \" , after which they created a photorealistic chipmunk through the use of 3D computer graphics software , Maya and Furrocious . When visual effects supervisor Thomas Schelesny showed the first animation of Pip to director Kevin Lima , he was surprised that he was a looking at CG character and not reference footage . To enhance facial expressions , the modelers gave Pip eyebrows , which real chipmunks do not have . During the filming of scenes in which Pip appears , a number of ways were used to indicate the physical presence of Pip . On some occasions , a small stuffed chipmunk with a wire armature on the inside was placed in the scene .

  "where <formula> is the mass of the object , <formula> is the velocity of the object and <formula> is the distance to the center of the circular path and <formula> is the unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center . This means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path . Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object , and therefore do not change the speed of the object ( magnitude of the velocity ) , but only the direction of the velocity vector . The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path , and one that is tangential to the path . This yields both the tangential force , which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up , and the radial ( centripetal ) force , which changes its direction .",

  "Photometric measurements of Vega during the 1930s appeared to show that the star had a low @-@ magnitude variability on the order of ± 0 @.@ 03 magnitudes . This range of variability was near the limits of observational capability for that time , and so the subject of Vega 's variability has been controversial .

This is a category of stars that oscillate in a coherent manner , resulting in periodic pulsations in the star 's luminosity .

  "Cannabis was completely legal in Oregon until 1935 , when the state passed the Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act . The legislative record contains no mention of those substances causing any problems , but they were simply included as part of the package . The Oregon Decriminalization Bill of 1973 abolished criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana .

  "In particular geographic regions , peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power . In the U.S. states of California and Texas , for example , hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to the use of air conditioning . Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers , to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70 % more efficient ; widespread adoption of this technology would better match electricity demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds . A possible future option may be to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with an HVDC \" super grid \" . In the U.S. it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least $ 60 billion , while the society value of added windpower would be more than that cost .",

  "One of the most significant studies on climate change and bees examined the species , B. Disinguendus and B. sylvarum between 2000 and 2006 in the UK . The study showed that as the climate of western Europe warmed , these two bee species experienced range declines and narrower climatic niches pushing them to the fringes of their environments . Geographically and climatically we expect this , as climate change continues bees will move and abandon areas of drought and migrate towards the fringes , as this has already been seen within desert oases . Europe has done significant work in tracking bee colony changes within the regions . Additional longitudinal surveillance needs to be conducted in other regions of the globe among a wider array bee species in order to build the body of research surrounding the impact of climate change on bees .",

  "Illicit distilleries were commonplace throughout the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant with the passing of the Excise Act in 1823 . It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed , subject to holding a license . Alexander Gordon , 4th Duke of Gordon , was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation . Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue , his tenant , George Smith , who was operating an illicit distillery at the time , became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit . This would prove to be an unpopular decision ; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed , something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law . Threats were made against George Smith , so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery .

  "Brown returned to first @-@ class cricket in 1947 – 48 , scoring 192 runs at 38 @.@ 40 in the first three matches of the season . The season saw an Indian tour of Australia . The selectors initially dropped Barnes to pair Brown with Morris to open the batting . Apart from two Tests during the 1936 – 37 season against England , Brown had not played Test cricket on Australian soil . He had only one opportunity with the bat in the First Test in Brisbane , making 11 as India fell to an innings defeat . It was to be his only innings and Test match on his home ground . Brown 's participation in the series was overshadowed by his controversial run out by Indian left arm orthodox spinner Vinoo Mankad in the Second Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground in December 1947 . Brown was run out for 18 , when in the act of delivering the ball , Mankad held on to it and whipped the bails off at the non @-@ striker 's end .

On that occasion , Mankad had warned Brown before running him out . The local press strongly accused Mankad of being unsportsmanlike , although some Australians — including Bradman — defended Mankad 's actions . For his part , Brown took full blame and made light of the incident through humorous gestures in later matches , which referred to the event . After this incident , if a batsman is given out this way , he is said to have been \" Mankaded \" .",

  "The disturbance to the field inside the line caused by the insertion of the probe is minimised as far as possible . There are two parts to this disturbance . The first part is due to the power the probe has extracted from the line and manifests as a lumped equivalent circuit of a resistor . This is minimised by limiting the distance the probe is inserted into the line so that only enough power is extracted for the detector to operate effectively . The second part of the disturbance is due to energy stored in the field around the probe and manifests as a lumped equivalent of a capacitor . This capacitance can be cancelled out with an inductance of equal and opposite impedance . Lumped inductors are not practical at microwave frequencies ; instead , an adjustable stub with an inductive equivalent circuit is used to \" tune out \" the probe capacitance . The result is an equivalent circuit of a high impedance in shunt across the line which has little effect on the transmitted power in the line . The probe is more sensitive as a result of this tuning and the distance it is inserted can be further limited as a result .",
  "Beginning with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings , Angelou used the same \" writing ritual \" for many years .

She would average 10 – 12 pages of written material a day , which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening .

  "After the disaster at Pearl Harbor Roosevelt turned to the most aggressive sailor available , Admiral Ernest J. King ( 1878 @-@ 1956 ) . Experienced in big guns , aviation and submarines , King had a broad knowledge and a total dedication to victory . He was perhaps the most dominating admiral in American naval history ; he was hated but obeyed , for he made all the decisions from his command post in the Washington , and avoided telling anyone . The civilian Secretary of the Navy was a cipher whom King kept in the dark ; that only changed when the Secretary died in 1944 and Roosevelt brought in his tough @-@ minded aide James Forrestal . Despite the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Admiral William D. Leahy to concentrate first against Germany , King made the defeat of Japan his highest priority . For example , King insisted on fighting for Guadalcanal despite strong Army objections . His main strike force was built around carriers based at Pearl Harbor under the command of Chester Nimitz . Nimitz had one main battle fleet , with the same ships and sailors but two command systems that rotated every few months between Admiral Bull Halsey and Admiral Raymond A. Spruance . The Navy had a major advantage : it had broken the Japanese code . It deduced that Hawaii was the target in June 1942 , and that Yamamoto ’ s fleet would strike at Midway Island . King only had four carriers in operation ; he sent them all to Midway where in a miraculous few minutes they sank the Japanese carriers . This gave the Americans the advantage in firepower that grew rapidly as new American warships came on line much faster than Japan could build them . King paid special attention to submarines to use against the overextended Japanese logistics system . They were built for long @-@ range missions in tropical waters , and set out to sink the freighters , troop transports and oil tankers that held the Japanese domains together . The Southwest Pacific theatre , based in Australia , was under the control of Army General Douglas MacArthur ; King assigned him a fleet of his own without any big carriers .",

He performed this role for the Soldiers ' Memorial Hall at Lameroo in 1926 , where his \" address was punctuated with applause \" . When his political enemies persistently queried the circumstances under which he was awarded the Military Cross , he published the citation in response . Despite Labor 's loss in the 1927 state election , Denny was returned first of three in the seat of Adelaide , with over 25 per cent of the vote . At the April 1930 state election , he was returned first of three with nearly 82 per cent of the ballots cast . Appointed Attorney @-@ General in the Labor government of Lionel Hill , Denny was also Minister of Railways , and for the first six months he was also Minister of Local Government . On Anzac Day 1931 , acting as Premier in Hill 's absence , he officiated at the unveiling of the National War Memorial at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue , Adelaide , before a crowd of about 75 @,@ 000 .

  "From its origin as a city @-@ state on the peninsula of Italy in the 8th century BC , to its rise as an empire covering much of Southern Europe , Western Europe , Near East and North Africa to its fall in the 5th century AD , the political history of Ancient Rome was closely entwined with its military history . The core of the campaign history of the Roman military is an aggregate of different accounts of the Roman military 's land battles , from its initial defense against and subsequent conquest of the city 's hilltop neighbors on the Italian peninsula , to the ultimate struggle of the Western Roman Empire for its existence against invading Huns , Vandals and Germanic tribes . These accounts were written by various authors throughout and after the history of the Empire . Following the First Punic War , naval battles were less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome due to its encompassment of lands of the periphery and its unchallenged dominance of the Mediterranean Sea .",

  "After the race , Merckx publicly dismissed the riders ' complaints . In particular , he made comparisons with the dangers that are accepted by the riders , such as those faced when riding Paris – Roubaix or descending on wet days in the Tour de France . Merckx also said that he was worried about the future of the race , as the local organisers were angry at the cancellation of the stage and had wanted to cancel stage 6 as well . He was also concerned about the renewal of the contract to run the Tour of Oman , after it expired in 2016 . Before the final stage – which did go ahead – he had agreed with the local authorities that the race would continue in 2016 . It was suggested , however , that the local organisers may refuse to invite certain teams back to future editions of the race . These teams possibly included Etixx – Quick @-@ Step and Trek Factory Racing since their riders were central to the rider protest .",

  "Blair describes the basic aim of the movement , both in England and on the Continent , as being \" to establish and disseminate high liturgical , spiritual and pastoral standards \" . On the Continent , cathedral chapters were staffed by secular canons , and only monasteries had monks . Æthelwold rejected this distinction ; his expulsion of clerics in favour of monks from Winchester Cathedral ( the Old Minster ) as well as the New Minster introduced a unique feature to the English reform . Dunstan and Oswald hesitated to follow his example , probably because unlike Æthelwold they had lived abroad and understood continental practice , and also because they preferred a gradualist approach to Æthelwold 's confrontational strategy . Oswald installed monks at Worcester Cathedral , but he built a new church for them and retained the clerics , who were educated with the monks in the same classroom . Canterbury did not become fully monastic until after Dunstan 's death . Æthelwold was a historian who was reviving what he believed to be the practice of the past , particularly Pope Gregory the Great 's injunction to Augustine in the Libellus Responsionum , as reported by Bede , that Augustine should continue as a bishop to live the life of a monk . Blair argues that large religious institutions could not function without priests carrying out parochial duties , and he comments that \" Æthelwold 's rejection of all forms of religious life but the monastic was decidedly odd . The lurid stigmatizations of clerics as foul , lazy , and lascivious come mainly from his circle . \" Although the Rule of Saint Benedict barred monks from engaging in external ministry , English Benedictines were actively engaged in pastoral work and teaching the secular clergy .",

  "A more progressive extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore in a heap leach . This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap ; the natural gas provides the heat ( needs to be at least 850 ° C ) and the reducing agent ( carbon monoxide ) . This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide ( MnO ) , which is a leachable form . The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150 – 250 μm , increasing the surface area to aid leaching . The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron ( Fe2 + ) in a 1 @.@ 6 : 1 ratio . The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese . This process yields approximately 92 % recovery of the manganese . For further purification , the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility .",

  "In August 1798 , the French Mediterranean Fleet was largely destroyed by a British fleet at the Battle of the Nile during the French invasion of Egypt . With the Royal Navy dominant in the Mediterranean Sea and their army trapped in Egypt , the French sought in 1801 to augment their depleted forces in the region by sending reinforcements from the Atlantic Fleet and by purchasing ships from the Spanish Navy , based in Cadiz . A squadron sailed from Brest on the Atlantic in January and made three failed attempts to reach Egypt , which was facing a large British invasion , before abandoning the effort and retiring to Toulon on the French Mediterranean coast . Three ships of the line , Formidable , Indomptable and Desaix , had been detached from the squadron in May however and were subsequently placed under the command of Contre @-@ Admiral Charles Linois under orders to sail for Cadiz .

  "In the 1940s , radio was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information . In the 1950s , it was television that was the new medium and it rapidly became global , bringing visual entertainment , first in black and white , then in colour , to the world . By the 1970s , games could be played electronically , then hand @-@ held devices provided mobile entertainment , and by the last decade of the 20th century , via networked play . In combination with products from the entertainment industry , all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally . People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music , film or game , they could choose the time and place to use it . The \" proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption \" together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films . One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid obsolescence of the various recording and storage methods . As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media , over the course of one generation , television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown , to novel , to ubiquitous and finally to superseded . One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a Wii console , \" about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953 \" . It is expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century , television will be completely replaced by online entertainment . The so @-@ called \" digital revolution \" has resulted in an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments , business , industries and individuals as they all try to keep up . Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly become a competitor with television viewing \" in terms of comfort , safety and the constant flow of audio @-@ visual information and entertainment available \" . Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes , where television , regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents , will need to be replaced by access to the internet . At the same time , the ongoing need for entertainers as \" professional engagers \" shows the continuity of traditional entertainment .",

  "Audition has been read as both feminist and misogynist . Miike has stated that when he met journalists in the United Kingdom and France , he found they commented on the film 's feminist themes when Asami gets revenge on the men in her life . The film sets up Aoyama with traits and behaviours which could be considered sexist : a list of criteria for his bride to meet , and the phoney audition format he uses to search for future wife . Tom Mes , author of Agitator : The Cinema of Takashi Miike stated that the torture sequence , with the mutilation of Aoyama , can be seen as revenge from Asami . Dennis Lim of the Los Angeles Times examined similar themes , noting that the film as \" ultimately about the male fear of women and female sexuality \" , noting that women are blatantly objectified in the first half of the film and in the second half Asami \" goes on to redress this imbalance \" when she becomes an \" avenging angel \" . Chris Pizzello , writing in the American Cinematographer , stated that one plausible approach to interpreting the film is to see the final act as a representation of Aoyama 's guilt at his mistreatment of women and his desire to dominate them . Aoyama develops a paranoid fantasy of an attacking object : because he harbours sadistic thoughts towards women , he develops a fear that the object will retaliate . Contrary to this , Miike has stated that the final torture scenes in the film are not a paranoid nightmare dreamed up by Aoyama . Mes has argued against the feminist portrayal of the film , noting that Asami is not motivated by an ideological agenda , and that acknowledging that she takes revenge on a man who has lied to her would be ignoring that she has also lied to Aoyama . Asami states \" I want to tell you everything \" during the torture scene , implying she had not been truthful before . Mes also notes that avenging angel theme contradicts the interpretation of a feminist @-@ themed revenge as one of people that Asami 's attacks was female .",

  "In the United States , Lafayette 's image , from the time of the American Revolution , derived from his \" disinterestedness \" in fighting , without pay , for the freedom of a country not his own . As Samuel Adams praised Lafayette , in \" foregoing the pleasures of Enjoyment of domestick [ sic ] Life and exposing himself to the Hardship and Dangers \" of war , he fought \" in the glorious cause of freedom \" . This view was shared by many contemporaries , establishing an image of Lafayette seeking to advance , not the national interest of one country or another , but the liberty of all mankind . As Lafayette took on his roles in the French Revolution , he gained a new role in American eyes : that of an advocate for the virtues of the American republic , seeking to transport them from New World to Old . This was reinforced by his position as surrogate son and disciple of George Washington , who was deemed the Father of His Country and the embodiment of the American experiment .",

  "Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in the study of partial differential equations . For many classes of partial differential equations , such as linear elliptic equations , it is possible to consider a generalized solution ( known as a weak solution ) by enlarging the class of functions . Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions , which is a Hilbert space . A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem of finding a solution or , often what is more important , showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data . For linear elliptic equations , one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax – Milgram theorem . This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method ( a finite element method ) for numerical solution of partial differential equations .",

  "Oswald Avery showed in 1943 that DNA was likely the genetic material of the chromosome , not its protein ; the issue was settled decisively with the 1952 Hershey – Chase experiment — one of many contributions from the so @-@ called phage group centered around physicist @-@ turned @-@ biologist Max Delbrück . In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick , building on the work of Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin , suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix . In their famous paper \" Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids \" , Watson and Crick noted coyly , \" It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material . \" After the 1958 Meselson – Stahl experiment confirmed the semiconservative replication of DNA , it was clear to most biologists that nucleic acid sequence must somehow determine amino acid sequence in proteins ; physicist George Gamow proposed that a fixed genetic code connected proteins and DNA . Between 1953 and 1961 , there were few known biological sequences — either DNA or protein — but an abundance of proposed code systems , a situation made even more complicated by expanding knowledge of the intermediate role of RNA . To actually decipher the code , it took an extensive series of experiments in biochemistry and bacterial genetics , between 1961 and 1966 — most importantly the work of Nirenberg and Khorana .",
  "Until the early twentieth century , readers reacted to \" Ulysses \" sympathetically . The meaning of the poem was increasingly debated as Tennyson 's stature rose . After Paull F.

Baum finds in Ulysses echoes of Lord Byron 's flawed heroes , who similarly display conflicting emotions , self @-@ critical introspection , and a rejection of social responsibility . Even Ulysses ' resolute final utterance — \" To strive , to seek , to find , and not to yield \" — is undercut by irony , when Baum and later critics compare this line to Satan 's \" courage never to submit or yield \" in John Milton 's Paradise Lost ( 1667 ) .",

  "Of all metals in pure form , tungsten has the highest melting point ( 3422 ° C , 6192 ° F ) , lowest vapor pressure ( at temperatures above 1650 ° C , 3000 ° F ) and the highest tensile strength . Although carbon remains solid at higher temperatures than tungsten , carbon sublimes , rather than melts , so tungsten is considered to have a higher melting point . Tungsten has the lowest coefficient of thermal expansion of any pure metal . The low thermal expansion and high melting point and tensile strength of tungsten originate from strong covalent bonds formed between tungsten atoms by the 5d electrons . Alloying small quantities of tungsten with steel greatly increases its toughness .",

  "Literary scholar M. Keith Booker argues that Vargas Llosa perfects the technique of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House . By combining two conversations that occur at different times , he creates the illusion of a flashback . Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique as a means of shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places . This technique is a staple of his repertoire , which he began using near the end of his first novel , The Time of the Hero . However , he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels . For example , in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space . In contrast , Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts . This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf 's mixing of different characters ' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert 's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events , such as speeches .",

  "Following the Norman conquest of England , Poole rapidly grew into a busy port as the importance of Wareham declined . The town was part of the manor of Canford , but does not exist as an identifiable entry in the Domesday Book . The earliest written mention of Poole occurred on a document from 1196 describing the newly built St James 's Chapel in \" La Pole \" . The Lord of the Manor , Sir William Longspée , sold a charter of liberties to the burgesses of Poole in 1248 to raise funds for his participation in the Seventh Crusade . Consequently , Poole gained a small measure of freedom from feudal rule and acquired the right to appoint a mayor and hold a court within town . Poole 's growing importance was recognised in 1433 when it was awarded staple port status by King Henry VI , enabling the port to begin exporting wool and in turn granting a licence for the construction of a town wall . In 1568 , Poole gained further autonomy when it was granted legal independence from Dorset and made a county corporate by the Great Charter of Elizabeth I. During the English Civil War , Poole 's puritan stance and its merchants ' opposition to the ship money tax introduced by King Charles I led to the town declaring for Parliament . Poole escaped any large @-@ scale attack and with the Royalists on the brink of defeat in 1646 , the Parliamentary garrison from Poole laid siege to and captured the nearby Royalist stronghold at Corfe Castle .",

He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns . Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters .

  "Forensic archaeologists employ their knowledge of proper excavation techniques to ensure that remains are recovered in a controlled and forensically acceptable manner . When remains are found partially or completely buried the proper excavation of the remains will ensure that any evidence present on the bones will remain intact . The difference between forensic archaeologists and forensic anthropologists is that where forensic anthropologists are trained specifically in human osteology and recovery of human remains , forensic archaeologists specialize more broadly in the processes of search and discovery . In addition to remains , archaeologists are trained to look for objects contained in and around the excavation area . These objects can include anything from wedding rings to potentially probative evidence such as cigarette butts or shoe prints . Their training extends further to observing context , association and significance of objects in a crime scene and drawing conclusions that may be useful for locating a victim or suspect . A forensic archaeologist must also be able to utilize a degree of creativity and adaptability during times when crime scenes can not be excavated using traditional archaeological techniques . For example , one particular case study was conducted on the search and recovery of the remains of a missing girl who was found in a septic tank underground . This instance required unique methods unlike those of a typical archeological excavation in order to exhume and preserve the contents of the tank .",

  "Of Etty 's two original works exhibited at the RA in 1830 , The Storm , inspired by Psalm 22 , attracted little interest and was dismissed by The Gentleman 's Magazine — typically a staunch supporter of Etty 's work — as \" a sad failure \" . The other painting exhibited was Candaules , King of Lydia , Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges , One of his Ministers , as She Goes to Bed , which was to prove one of the most controversial works of Etty 's career .

  "Article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a \" Turk \" as \" anyone who is bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship \" ; therefore , the legal use of the term \" Turkish \" as a citizen of Turkey is different from the ethnic definition . However , the majority of the Turkish population are of Turkish ethnicity . They are estimated at 70 – 75 percent . Reliable data on the ethnic mix of the population is not available , because Turkish census figures do not include statistics on ethnicity . The three \" Non @-@ Muslim \" minority groups claimed to be officially recognized in the Treaty of Lausanne are Armenians , Greeks and Jews . Officially unrecognized ( mostly Muslim ) ethnic groups include Albanians , Arabs , Assyrians , Azeris , Bosniaks , Circassians , Georgians , Lazs , Persians , Pomaks ( Bulgarians ) , Yazidis and Roma . The Kurds , a distinct ethnic group , are the largest non @-@ Turkic ethnicity , around 18 – 25 percent of the population . Kurds are concentrated in the east and southeast of the country , in what is also known as Turkish Kurdistan . Kurds make up a majority in the provinces of Tunceli , Bingöl , Muş , Ağrı , Iğdır , Elâzığ , Diyarbakır , Batman , Şırnak , Bitlis , Van , Mardin , Siirt and Hakkari , a near majority in Şanlıurfa province ( 47 % ) , and a large minority in Kars province ( 20 % ) . In addition , due to internal migration , Kurdish communities exist in all major cities in central and western Turkey , particularly in Istanbul , where there are an estimated 3 million Kurds , making Istanbul the city with the largest Kurdish population in the world . Minorities besides the Kurds are thought to make up an estimated 7 – 12 percent of the population . Minorities other than the three officially recognized ones do not have any minority rights . The term \" minority \" itself remains a sensitive issue in Turkey , while the Turkish government is frequently criticized for its treatment of minorities . Although minorities are not recognised , state @-@ run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation ( TRT ) broadcasts television and radio programs in minority languages . Also , some minority language classes can be chosen in elementary schools .",
  "Later reviews have generally been more positive .

  "By mid @-@ 1968 , No. 79 Squadron no longer had a clear role at Ubon . The USAF had sufficient fighters based in Thailand to defend the country and was reluctant to use the Australian fighters — which were now regarded as obsolete — to intercept potentially hostile aircraft , as the squadron 's rules of engagement did not allow it to pursue contacts that left Thai airspace . As a result , the Australian military 's chiefs of staff determined that the RAAF presence in Thailand had outlived its political and military usefulness and decided to withdraw the squadron without replacement . No. 79 Squadron was taken off alert status on 26 July and disbanded at the end of the month . On 31 March 2011 it received a battle honour for its deployment to Ubon between May 1962 and August 1968 . ( II )",
  "Oral polio vaccine ( OPV ) is an attenuated vaccine , produced by the passage of the virus through non @-@ human cells at a sub @-@ physiological temperature , which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome . Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups , one of which was led by Albert Sabin . Other groups , led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox , developed their own attenuated vaccine strains . In 1958 , the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines . The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio , while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys . Large @-@ scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine . Based on these results , the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution . There are 57 nucleotide substitutions which distinguish the attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent ( the Mahoney serotype ) , two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain , and 10 substitutions are involved in attenuating the Sabin 3 strain . The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus 's internal ribosome entry site ( IRES ) which alters stem @-@ loop structures , and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell . The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut , the primary site of infection and replication , but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue . In 1961 , type 1 and 2 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine ( MOPV ) was licensed , and in 1962 , type 3 MOPV was licensed . In 1963 , trivalent OPV ( TOPV ) was licensed , and became the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world , largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine . A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic decline in the number of polio cases . Between 1962 and 1965 about 100 million Americans ( roughly 56 % of the population at that time ) received the Sabin vaccine . The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases , even from the much reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine .",
  "The VB series retained 96 percent of the preceding HZ Kingswood 's interior space , despite being 14 percent smaller in overall dimensions , although five percent larger than the Torana . With the Commodore dropping a full class below the Kingswood and its Ford Falcon competitor , the smaller Commodore was predictably more fuel @-@ efficient .

  "Of the dozens of extant wasp families , only the family Vespidae contains any social species , primarily in the subfamilies Vespinae and Polistinae . With their powerful stings and conspicuous warning coloration , often in black and yellow , social wasps are frequent models for Batesian mimicry by non @-@ stinging insects , and are themselves involved in mutually beneficial Müllerian mimicry of other distasteful insects including bees and other wasps . All species of social wasps construct their nests using some form of plant fiber ( mostly wood pulp ) as the primary material , though this can be supplemented with mud , plant secretions ( e.g. , resin ) , and secretions from the wasps themselves ; multiple fibrous brood cells are constructed , arranged in a honeycombed pattern , and often surrounded by a larger protective envelope . Wood fibers are gathered from weathered wood , softened by chewing and mixing with saliva . The placement of nests varies from group to group ; yellow jackets such as D. media and D. sylvestris prefer to nest in trees and shrubs ; P. exigua attaches its nests on the underside of leaves and branches ; Polistes erythrocephalus chooses sites close to a water source . Other wasps , like A. multipicta and V. germanica , like to nest in cavities that include holes in the ground , spaces under homes , wall cavities or in lofts . While most species of wasps have nests with multiple combs , some species , such as Apoica flavissima , only have one comb . The length of the reproductive cycle depends on latitude ; Polistes erythrocephalus , for example , has a much longer ( up to 3 months longer ) cycle in temperate regions .",

  "I think the authors of that notable instrument intended to include all men , but they did not mean to declare all men equal in all respects . They did not mean to say all men were equal in color , size , intellect , moral development , or social capacity . They defined with tolerable distinctness in what they did consider all men created equal — equal in \" certain inalienable rights , among which are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . \" This they said , and this they meant . They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth that all were then actually enjoying that equality , or yet that they were about to confer it immediately upon them . In fact , they had no power to confer such a boon . They meant simply to declare the right , so that the enforcement of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit . They meant to set up a standard maxim for free society which should be familiar to all , constantly looked to , constantly labored for , and even , though never perfectly attained , constantly approximated , and thereby constantly spreading and deepening its influence , and augmenting the happiness and value of life to all people , of all colors , everywhere .",

  "In Quenya , the stressing of a syllable is predictable and non @-@ phonemic ( i.e. the meaning of a word never changes depending on the stress ) , but it is partly determined by syllable weight .

In words of three or more syllables , the stress is on the penultimate syllable if this is heavy , otherwise on the antepenultimate syllable , i.e. the third @-@ to @-@ last syllable . In Quenya , heavy syllables are syllables that contain either a long vowel , a diphthong , or a cluster of two consonants ( ll , ld , mm , ss , etc . ) . Certain combinations of consonants , e.g. ny , ry , are also regarded as heavy . Medially hy and hw are long consonants in Parmaquesta ( not colloquially in Tarquesta ) and a vowel before them is held to constitute a metrically long syllable . Quenya has also a secondary accent . The placement of stress and the distinction between heavy and light syllables is important in Quenya verse .",

  "In the late 1930s , logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America . By then , many had replaced Mach 's phenomenalism with Otto Neurath 's physicalism , and Rudolf Carnap had sought to replace verification with simply confirmation . With World War II 's close in 1945 , logical positivism became milder , logical empiricism , led largely by Carl Hempel , in America , who expounded the covering law model of scientific explanation as a way of identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of \" causation \" . The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of analytic philosophy , and dominated Anglosphere philosophy , including philosophy of science , while influencing sciences , into the 1960s . Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems , and its doctrines were increasingly assaulted . Nevertheless , it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy , with Carl Hempel playing a key role .",

  "Before the 12th century , Jain writers had dominated Kannada literature with their champu ( verses mixed with prose ) style of writings popular in court literature . In the later medieval period , they had to contend with the Veerashaivas who challenged the very notion of royal literature with their vachana poetry , a stylised form of spoken language , more popular in folk genres . The popular growth of Veerashaiva ( devotees of the Hindu god Shiva ) literature began in the 12th century , while Vaishnava ( devotees of the Hindu god Vishnu ) writers began to exert their influence from the 15th century .

The Veerashaivas had initiated an important change , casting aside the concept of formal literature and making way for shorter local genres . The Vaishnava haridasas later popularised musical forms that were more acceptable to the common man . Written classics eulogising kings and commanders were a thing of the past .

  "Organized exploration of the upper Yellowstone River began in fall 1869 when the Cook – Folsom – Peterson Expedition made a month @-@ long journey up the Yellowstone River and into the geyser basins . In 1870 , the somewhat more official Washburn – Langford – Doane Expedition explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins , naming Old Faithful and many other park features . Official reports from Lieutenant Gustavus Cheyney Doane and Scribner 's Monthly accounts by Nathaniel P. Langford brought increased public awareness to the natural wonders of the region . Influenced by Jay Cooke of the Northern Pacific Railroad and Langford 's public speeches about the Yellowstone on the East Coast , geologist Ferdinand Hayden sought funding from Congress for an expedition under the auspices of the U.S. Geological Survey . In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $ 40 @,@ 000 to finance the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871 . Hayden was given instructions by Grant 's Secretary of Interior , Columbus Delano . The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians , mostly scientists , and two military escorts . Among the survey party were artist Thomas Moran and photographer William Henry Jackson . Hayden 's published reports , magazine articles , along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone . On December 18 , 1871 , a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate , by Senator S.C. Pomeroy of Kansas , and in the House of Representatives , by Congressman William H. Clagett of the Montana Territory , for the establishment of a park at the headwaters of the Yellowstone River . Hayden 's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands : \" The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement , occupancy , or sale , under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty @-@ five by sixty @-@ five miles , about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers , and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure @-@ ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people . \" When the bill was presented to Congress , the bill 's chief supporters , ably prepared by Langford , Hayden and Jay Cooke , convinced their colleagues that the region 's real value was as a park area , to be preserved in its natural state . The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30 , 1872 , and by the House on February 27 . On March 1 , 1872 , Grant played his role , in signing the \" Act of Dedication \" into law . It established the Yellowstone region as the nation ’ s first national park , made possible by three years of exploration by Cook @-@ Folsom @-@ Peterson ( 1869 ) , Washburn @-@ Langford @-@ Doane ( 1870 ) , and Hayden ( 1871 ) .",

In 1885 , Deady admitted Mary Leonard to the federal bar , the first woman admitted to practice in Oregon , though the Oregon Supreme Court at first denied her admittance to the state bar on technical grounds . Later that year the Oregon legislature resolved the technical issue in the statute and the state high court admitted Leonard into the state bar .",

  "The Chou ( 丑 ) is a male clown role . The Chou usually plays secondary roles in a troupe . Indeed , most studies of Peking opera classify the Chou as a minor role . Chou roles can be divided into Wen Chou , civilian roles such as merchants and jailers , and Wu Chou , minor military roles . The Wu Chou is one of the most demanding in Peking opera , because of its combination of comic acting , acrobatics , and a strong voice . Chou characters are generally amusing and likable , if a bit foolish . Their costumes range from simple for characters of lower status to elaborate , perhaps overly so , for high status characters . Chou characters wear special face paint , called xiaohualian , that differs from that of Jing characters . The defining characteristic of this type of face paint is a small patch of white chalk around the nose . This can represent either a mean and secretive nature or a quick wit . Originally , there were five roles in Beijing Opera , but the last role \" Mo \" became a part of \" Chou \" .",

  "There were many technical and scientific writings during the Song period . The two most eminent authors of the scientific and technical fields were Shen Kuo ( 1031 – 1095 ) and his contemporary Su Song ( 1020 – 1101 ) . Shen Kuo published his Dream Pool Essays in 1088 AD , an enormous encyclopedic book that covered a wide range of subjects , including literature , art , military strategy , mathematics , astronomy , meteorology , geology , geography , metallurgy , engineering , hydraulics , architecture , zoology , botany , agronomy , medicine , anthropology , archeology , and more . As for Shen Kuo 's equally brilliant peer , Su Song created a celestial atlas of five different star maps , wrote the 1070 AD pharmaceutical treatise of the Ben Cao Tu Jing ( Illustrated Pharmacopoeia ) , which had the related subjects of botany , zoology , metallurgy , and mineralogy , and wrote his famous horological treatise of the Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao in 1092 AD , which described in full detail his ingenious astronomical clock tower constructed in the capital city of Kaifeng . Although these two figures were perhaps the greatest technical authors in their field during the time , there were many others . For producing textiles , Qin Guan 's book of 1090 AD , the Can Shu ( Book of Sericulture ) , included description of a silk @-@ reeling machine that incorporated the earliest known use of the mechanical belt drive in order to function . In the literary field of agronomy , there was the Jiu Huang Huo Min Shu ( The Rescue of the People ; a Treatise on Famine Prevention and Relief ) edited by Dong Wei in the 12th century , the Cha Lu ( Record of Tea ) written by Cai Xiang in 1060 AD , the Zhu Zi Cang Fa ( Master Zhu on Managing Communal Granaries ) written by Zhu Xi in 1182 AD , and many others . There were also great authors of written works pertaining to geography and cartography during the Song , such as Yue Shi ( his book in 983 ) , Wang Zhu ( in 1051 ) , Li Dechu ( in 1080 ) , Chen Kunchen ( in 1111 ) , Ouyang Wen ( in 1117 ) , and Zhu Mu ( in 1240 ) . Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century , the matured form known as \" treatise on a place \" , or fangzhi , replaced the old \" map guide \" , or tujing , under the Song . The major differences between the two were that fangzhi were products of local initiative and decision @-@ making , were typically ten to fifty chapters in length , and were almost always printed for a large audience , whereas tujing were products of infrequent demands from the central government and were typically only four chapters long . The widespread availability of printing in the Song allowed many ordinary people to access materials that were once read almost exclusively by experts , such as printed texts and handbooks on agriculture , childbirth , pharmacy and medicine , domestic economics , geography , divination , and Taoist rituals .",
  "The Allied Air Forces had used 233 @,@ 847 rounds of ammunition , and dropped 261 500 @-@ pound and 253 thousand @-@ pound bombs . They claimed 19 hits and 42 near misses with the former , and 59 hits and 39 near misses from the latter . Of the 137 bombs dropped in low level attacks , 48 , or 35 percent , were claimed to have hit , but only 29 , or 7 @.@ 5 percent , of the 387 bombs dropped from medium altitude . This compared favourably with efforts in August and September 1942 when only 3 percent of bombs dropped were claimed to have scored hits . It was noted that the high and medium altitude attacks scored few hits but dispersed the convoy , while the strafing runs from the Beaufighters had knocked out many of the ships ' anti @-@ aircraft defences . Aircraft attacking from multiple directions had confused and overwhelmed the Japanese defences , resulting in lower casualties and more accurate bombing . The results therefore vindicated not just the tactics of mast height attack , but of mounting coordinated attacks from multiple directions . The Japanese estimated that at least 29 bombs had hit a ship during the battle . This was a big improvement over the Battle of Wau back in January , when Allied aircraft attacked a Japanese convoy consisting of five destroyers and five troop transports travelling from Rabaul to Lae , but managed to sink just one transport and beach another .",
  "The Common Pleas ' jurisdiction was over \" common pleas , \" cases where the king had no interest . This in practice meant cases between subject and subject , including all actions taken under praecipe to recover debts or property , which made up the vast majority of civil cases . As such , the Common Pleas \" was the court which more than any other shaped the medieval common law \" . It was the court where most students went to learn , and the majority of the early case reports come from the Common Pleas . The court was called \" the lock and key of the common law \" by Sir Edward Coke , since throughout its history it was the only court where claims involving real property could be brought , giving it a wider remit to set precedent than the other courts . For almost all of its history , Serjeants at Law and King 's Serjeants were the only advocates given rights of audience in the Court of Common Pleas . As part of the Court of Common Pleas the Serjeants also performed some judicial duties , such as levying fines . In 1834 Lord Brougham issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the Court of Common Pleas to every barrister , Serjeant or not , and this was followed for six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid . The Serjeants only enjoyed their returned status for another six years , however , before Parliament intervened .

Neither ship was well placed to fight the larger French force and both were taken by surprise , only alerted to the French escape by the brig HMS Hazard under Captain Hugh Cameron shortly before 22 : 00 . Pompee was closest to the French , and Captain William Charles Fahie managed to fire two broadsides into the rearmost ship , Hautpoult before the Troude 's squadron pulled away from her . Neptune , Pompee and the small brig HMS Recruit took up the chase , the fast Recruit annoying the French with persistent minor attacks , while Neptune came too close to Hautpoult and was fired on , losing one man killed and four wounded . The French escape , while necessitated by the British battery , was actually a feint : the frigates Félicité and Furieuse had remained hidden off the Saintes during the night and at 09 : 00 on 15 April , with the main combat continuing to the west , slipped away into Basse @-@ Terre on Guadeloupe , chased in vain by HMS Intrepid under Captain Warwick Lake .

  "Unlike most EU states , which usually operate parliamentary systems , there is a separation of powers between the executive and legislative which makes the European Parliament more akin to the United States Congress than an EU state legislature . The President of the European Commission is proposed by the European Council on the basis of the European elections to Parliament .

Following the approval of the Commission President , the members of the Commission are proposed by the President in accord with the member @-@ states .

  "Talbot Baines Reed grew up in a happy household , dominated by Charles Reed 's religious zeal and his belief that hardy outdoor sports were the best means for bringing up boys . This atmosphere of \" simple , cheerful Puritanism \" was , according to a friend , \" eminently suited to [ Talbot 's ] character and disposition \" . Talbot began his education at Priory House School , Clapton , and in 1864 became a day pupil at the City of London School , a relatively new foundation that had been established in Milk Street , Cheapside , in 1837 . Talbot 's eldest brother , Charles junior , had been notably successful there , as captain of the school and a leading figure in its cricket and football teams . Talbot soon made his own mark , particularly on the sporting field ; a contemporary describes him as \" full of life and vigour ... his strength of muscle , length of limb , boldness of attack , absolute fearlessness and perfection of nerve always made him conspicuous \" . Reed later showed some reticence about his academic achievements , asserting that one of his few successes was winning \" the comfortable corner desk near the fire \" , reserved for the bottom place in Mathematics . In fact , in keeping with the school 's record of producing men of letters and language scholars , Reed had excellent results in French , Greek and Latin , and had competed for the Sixth Form Latin prize . One of his school contemporaries was Herbert Henry Asquith , the future British prime minister .",

In addition the tentacles , whose surface area is increased by microvilli ( small hairs and pleats ) , absorb organic compounds dissolved in the water . Unwanted particles may be flicked away by tentacles or shut out by closing the mouth .
