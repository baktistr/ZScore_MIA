The rail line passed 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) south of the town and a station was built 2 miles ( 3 km ) distant . The line opened , and the first train passed near Hagley , on 10 February 1871 . The rail line carried passengers , and several daily mail deliveries . Launceston and Western Railway soon ran into financial problems , the line closed 29 June 1872 and the company itself went bankrupt on 25 July . The government took over the railway , as the Tasmanian Government Railways , on 31 October 1873 . Local farmers petitioned for an additional line to properties in Hagley 's west . Construction began on the new line in 1887 and a siding as built at the intersection of Hoggs Lane . This siding was used first for farm produce , later facilities for loading stock were added . A platform and waiting room were added in 1910 , though it was some years before passenger trains stopped at Hoggs Lane . The passenger rail service had stopped before 1978 , a time when all Tasmanian passenger rail services ceased .",

  "Belle appeared in the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast . The role was originated by actress Susan Egan , who was initially reluctant to audition for Beauty and the Beast because she \" thought it was a terrible idea for Disney to put a cartoon on Broadway . \" However , her agent managed to convince her otherwise , and Egan ultimately turned down callbacks for roles in the musicals My Fair Lady , Carousel and Grease in favor of starring as Belle in Beauty and the Beast because she had always wanted to originate a Broadway role . Egan had never watched Beauty and the Beast prior to her audition , relying solely on \" her own creative instincts \" instead . Egan 's performance earned her a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress in a Musical at the 48th Tony Awards .

  "In response to the harshness of the rule in Lee Mau Seng , academics have offered several suggestions for circumventing it . One is that the definition of mala fides used by the courts in Lee Mau Seng is actually unreasonableness and not mala fides in the narrow sense of dishonesty or bad faith . In Cannock Chase District Council v. Kelly ( 1977 ) , Lord Justice Megaw asserted that bad faith is \" dishonesty \" and \" always involves a grave charge \" . This contrasts with the meaning of mala fides in Lee Mau Seng which includes situations of carelessness or vagueness . Thus , an allegation of bad faith in the narrow sense could permit review by the courts .",

  "Two types of analysis are used in the bioprospecting of metagenomic data : function @-@ driven screening for an expressed trait , and sequence @-@ driven screening for DNA sequences of interest . Function @-@ driven analysis seeks to identify clones expressing a desired trait or useful activity , followed by biochemical characterization and sequence analysis .

Moreover , the low rate of discovery ( less than one per 1 @,@ 000 clones screened ) and its labor @-@ intensive nature further limit this approach .

  "Any two human genomes differ in millions of different ways . There are small variations in the individual nucleotides of the genomes ( SNPs ) as well as many larger variations , such as deletions , insertions and copy number variations . Any of these may cause alterations in an individual 's traits , or phenotype , which can be anything from disease risk to physical properties such as height . Around the year 2000 , prior to the introduction of GWA studies , the primary method of investigation was through inheritance studies of genetic linkage in families . This approach had proven highly useful towards single gene disorders . However , for common and complex diseases the results of genetic linkage studies proved hard to reproduce . A suggested alternative to linkage studies was the genetic association study . This study type asks if the allele of a genetic variant is found more often than expected in individuals with the phenotype of interest ( e.g. with the disease being studied ) . Early calculations on statistical power indicated that this approach could be better than linkage studies at detecting weak genetic effects .",

However , the statements of Michael Wainwright , and another of Gordon 's cellmates , who had learning difficulties , were also used as evidence by the prosecution .

  "Despite this evidence of Mercian involvement in the southeast there is very little indication that Æthelred had expansionist ambitions to the south .

At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town but took shelter in a fort . The guerrillas were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived , killing three of Anderson 's men . In late July , the Union military sent a force of 100 well @-@ equipped soldiers , and 650 other men , after Anderson . On July 30 , Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia 's commanding officer . They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man 's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush , before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment . On August 1 , while searching for militia members , Anderson and some of his men stopped at a house full of women and requested food . While they rested at the house , a group of local men attacked . The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee , and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house . This action angered his men , who saw themselves as the protectors of women , but Anderson dismissed their concerns , stating that such things were inevitable . They chased the men who had attacked them , killing one and mutilating his body . By August 1864 , they were regularly scalping the men that they killed .",

  "In aqueous solution , the alkali metal ions form aqua ions of the formula [ M ( H2O ) n ] + , where n is the solvation number . Their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii . In aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the first coordination sphere , also known as the first , or primary , solvation shell . The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond , with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond . Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules . The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere . However , for the alkali metal cations , the second coordination sphere is not well @-@ defined as the + 1 charge on the cation is not high enough to polarize the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere , producing a more stable entity . The solvation number for Li + has been experimentally determined to be 4 , forming the tetrahedral [ Li ( H2O ) 4 ] + : while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions , solvation numbers less than 4 may be the result of the formation of contact ion @-@ pairs , and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach [ Li ( H2O ) 4 ] + through a face of the tetrahedron , though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedral hexaaqua ion . There are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion , forming the octahedral [ Na ( H2O ) 6 ] + ion . While it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions , it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the [ K ( H2O ) 8 ] + and [ Rb ( H2O ) 8 ] + ions , which have the square antiprismatic structure , and that caesium forms the 12 @-@ coordinate [ Cs ( H2O ) 12 ] + ion .",

Like its predecessor , the FDS version appears to be an earlier version of the game , with a few obvious differences . In the English release , the dungeons each have different colors , whereas in the FDS version they are all gray . Also , the two dungeon bosses Carrok and Volvagia ( the latter being initially named Barba in the NES release ) have different graphical appearances . The game over screen in the English version features the silhouette of Ganon from the chest up , with the text saying \" Game Over / Return of Ganon \" , whereas the FDS game over screen is a plain black screen with the text saying \" Return of Ganon / The End \" . There are some slight additions to the dungeons , as well as a handful of differences on the dungeons themselves . Due to an additional soundchip that the Disk System has , when Nintendo ported Zelda II over to the NES they had to eliminate some musical elements , especially from the title screen . On the main map , the icons denoting attacking monsters look different , but the most significant change is the spending of experience points , as Link 's three attributes cost the same , unlike the worldwide release . Further , the game is designed to promote balanced leveling , as the saved game on the disk will only let the levels for the attributes go as high as whatever is set the lowest ( e.g. if Life is at 5 and Strength is at 4 , but Magic is at 1 , then the saved game will reflect all as level 1 ) , while still saving the data regarding crystals that have been placed and items that have been collected . These differences make leveling up in the game very different .",

Henry Percy commissioned the building of the distinctive keep shortly after he was made Earl of Northumberland . Percy may have enhanced his main castle to compete with John of Gaunt , who rebuilt the nearby Dunstanburgh Castle , or with the House of Neville , a family becoming increasingly powerful in northern England and who undertook a programme of building at the castles of Brancepeth , Raby , Bamburgh , Middleham , and Sheriff Hutton . Architectural similarities between Warkworth 's keep , Bolton Castle , and the domestic buildings at Bamburgh Castle suggest that John Lewyn was the master mason responsible for building Warkworth 's keep . Earl Henry helped dethrone Richard II and replace him with Henry IV . The earl and his eldest son Henry \" Hotspur \" Percy fell out with the new king , and eventually rebelled . After Hotspur was killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403 , his father fled to Warkworth . The earl eventually went to York to submit to the king .

  "They have been observed ingesting large amounts during each feeding period , and mothers may leave them unattended in the burrow for between five and ten days to find food . Studies of captives have shown they can ingest milk once every two or three days and then increase their mass by 20 % in one milk @-@ drinking session lasting between one and two hours . Around 40 % of the milk weight is converted into body mass , and as such , a high proportion of milk is converted into growth ; a correlation with the growth of the puggle and its mother 's size has been observed .

If he confessed to having used the spoils , he was guilty of misappropriation . If he claimed that he gave from his own pocket , he was guilty of extravagance . In either case he would be dismissed , and Abu Ubaida would take charge of his duties . Abu Ubaida was himself an admirer of Khalid and loved him as his younger brother , and so said that he was not capable of doing it . Instead , Bilal ibn Ribah was appointed for this task and called back Khalid from Chalcis to Emessa , where he was charged publicly .

The current definition uses the recommended value in metres for the previous definition of the astronomical unit , which was determined by measurement . This redefinition is analogous to that of the metre , and likewise has the effect of fixing the speed of light to an exact value in astronomical units per second ( via the exact speed of light in metres per second ) .",

  "Bob Weinstein approached Craven early in the planning stages , because he felt Craven 's previous work in the genre that combined horror and comedy would make him the perfect person to bring Williamson 's script to screen . Craven was already busy developing a remake of The Haunting and was considering distancing himself from the horror genre . He was growing weary of the inherent misogyny and violence . Weinstein approached other directors , including Robert Rodriguez , Danny Boyle , George A. Romero , and Sam Raimi .

There are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance , although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions . It is one of the two largest corvids , alongside the thick @-@ billed raven , and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird ; at maturity , the common raven averages 63 centimetres ( 25 inches ) in length and 1 @.@ 2 kilograms ( 2 @.@ 6 pounds ) in mass . Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild , a lifespan exceeded among passerines by only a few Australasian species such as the satin bowerbird and probably the lyrebirds . Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life , with each mated pair defending a territory .",

  "When a continuous spectrum of energy is passed through a gas or plasma , some of the photons are absorbed by atoms , causing electrons to change their energy level . Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon , traveling in a random direction , and so drop back to lower energy levels . Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output . ( An observer viewing the atoms from a view that does not include the continuous spectrum in the background , instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms . ) Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined .",

  "During his tenure as a civil engineer , Lemoine wrote a treatise concerning compass and straightedge constructions entitled , La Géométrographie ou l 'art des constructions géométriques , which he considered his greatest work , despite the fact that it was not well @-@ received critically . The original title was De la mesure de la simplicité dans les sciences mathématiques , and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics . Time constraints , however , limited the scope of the paper . Instead of the original idea , Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the compass and straightedge . He presented this paper at a meeting of the Association Française in Oran , Algeria in 1888 . The paper , however , did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there . Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year , including Sur la mesure de la simplicité dans les constructions géométriques in the Comptes rendus of the Académie française .

  "The oldest existing record of Kannada poetry in Tripadi metre is the Kappe Arabhatta record of AD 700 . Kavirajamarga by King Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I ( AD 850 ) is the earliest existing literary work in Kannada . It is a writing on literary criticism and poetics meant to standardise various written Kannada dialects used in literature in previous centuries . The book makes reference to Kannada works by early writers such as King Durvinita of the 6th century and Ravikirti , the author of the Aihole record of 636 AD . Since the earliest available Kannada work is one on grammar and a guide of sorts to unify existing variants of Kannada grammar and literary styles , it can be safely assumed that literature in Kannada must have started several centuries earlier .

  "Historically , English patent law was based on custom and the common law , not on statute . It began as the Crown granted patents as a form of economic protection to ensure high industrial production . As gifts from the crown , there was no judicial review , oversight or consideration , and no actual law developed around patents . This practice came from the guilds , groups who were controlled by the Crown and held monopolies over particular industries . By the 14th century the economy of England was lagging behind that of other European nations , with the guilds too small to control industrial production successfully . To remedy this , Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England , offering \" letters of protection \" that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge . The first recorded letter of protection was given in 1331 . The letters did not grant a full monopoly ; rather they acted as an extended passport , allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade . An exceptional example ( considered the first full patent in England ) was issued to John of Utynam on 3 April 1449 , granting him a monopoly . Overseas , the practice of granting full industrial patents and monopolies became common in Italian states by the 1420s .",
  "Sanders was dissatisfied with the 35 minutes it took to prepare his chicken in an iron frying pan , but he did not want to deep fry . Although a much faster process , in Sanders ' opinion it produced dry and crusty chicken that was unevenly cooked . On the other hand , if he prepared the chicken in advance of an order , there was sometimes waste at the end of the day . In 1939 , the first commercial pressure cookers were released onto the market , predominantly designed for steaming vegetables . Sanders bought one and modified it into a pressure fryer , which he then used to prepare chicken . The new method reduced production time to be comparable with deep frying , yet , in Sanders ' opinion , retained the quality of pan @-@ fried chicken .

  "The origins of Leon – Eline were from a low pressure area that developed within the monsoon trough on February 1 in the eastern Indian Ocean , about 250 km ( 155 mi ) south of the Indonesian island of Bali .

Over the subsequent few days the system tracked west @-@ southwestward without much development , moving around a large ridge over northwestern Australia . There was initially moderate wind shear in the region . However , a developing anticyclone allowed the convection to persist over the center and develop outflow .

  "Many of the skeletal features that distinguish the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire , its closest relative , from pigeons have been attributed to their flightlessness . The pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted pigeons to support the higher weight , and the pectoral region and the small wings were paedomorphic , meaning that they were underdeveloped and retained juvenile features . The skull , trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic , meaning that they changed considerably with age . The dodo shared several other traits with the Rodrigues solitaire , such as features of the skull , pelvis , and sternum , as well as their large size . It differed in other aspects , such as being more robust and shorter than the solitaire , having a larger skull and beak , a rounded skull roof , and smaller orbits . The dodo 's neck and legs were proportionally shorter , and it did not possess an equivalent to the knob present on the solitaire 's wrists .",

  "H II regions come in an enormous variety of sizes . They are usually clumpy and inhomogeneous on all scales from the smallest to largest . Each star within an H II region ionises a roughly spherical region — known as a Strömgren sphere — of the surrounding gas , but the combination of ionisation spheres of multiple stars within a H II region and the expansion of the heated nebula into surrounding gases creats sharp density gradients that result in complex shapes . Supernova explosions may also sculpt H II regions . In some cases , the formation of a large star cluster within an H II region results in the region being hollowed out from within . This is the case for NGC 604 , a giant H II region in the Triangulum Galaxy . For a HII region which cannot be resolved , some information on the spatial structure ( the electron density as a function of the distance from the center , and an estimate of the clumpiness ) can be inferred by performing an inverse Laplace transform on the frequency spectrum .",

  "Tariff reform and the gold standard also divided the country and the major parties . The monetary debate was over the basis for the value of the United States dollar . Nothing but gold and silver coin had ever been legal tender in the United States until the Civil War , when the mounting costs of the war forced the United States Congress to issue \" greenbacks \" ( dollar bills backed by government bonds ) .

  "McKinley increasingly became a significant figure in national politics . In 1880 , he served a brief term as Ohio 's representative on the Republican National Committee . In 1884 , he was elected a delegate to that year 's Republican convention , where he served as chair of the Committee on Resolutions and won plaudits for his handling of the convention when called upon to preside . By 1886 , McKinley , Senator John Sherman , and Governor Joseph B. Foraker were considered the leaders of the Republican party in Ohio . Sherman , who had helped to found the Republican Party , ran three times for the Republican nomination for president in the 1880s , each time failing , while Foraker began a meteoric rise in Ohio politics early in the decade . Hanna , once he entered public affairs as a political manager and generous contributor , supported Sherman 's ambitions , as well as those of Foraker . The latter relationship broke off at the 1888 Republican National Convention , where McKinley , Foraker , and Hanna were all delegates supporting Sherman . Convinced Sherman could not win , Foraker threw his support to the unsuccessful Republican 1884 presidential nominee , Maine Senator James G. Blaine . When Blaine stated he was not a candidate , Foraker returned to Sherman , but the nomination went to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison , who was elected president . In the bitterness that followed the convention , Hanna abandoned Foraker , and for the rest of McKinley 's life , the Ohio Republican Party was divided into two factions , one aligned with McKinley , Sherman , and Hanna and the other with Foraker . Hanna came to admire McKinley and became a friend and close adviser to him . Although Hanna remained active in business and in promoting other Republicans , in the years after 1888 , he spent an increasing amount of time boosting McKinley 's political career .",

  "From 1870 to 1880 it became clear that cell nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the substance of another nucleus . In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half of each of the chromosomes of the mother nucleus : then by the early 20th century it was found that the number of chromosomes in a given species is constant . With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells ( in pollen and embryo ) have a reducing division ( halving of chromosomes , now known as meiosis ) the field of heredity was opened up . By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function . The form and function of plastids received similar attention , the association with starch being noted at an early date . With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material , the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles – what is now known as cytology , or cell theory became firmly established .",

No \" Buceran \" denomination , however , emerged from his ministry , probably because he never developed a systematic theology as Melanchthon had for the Lutheran church and Calvin for the Reformed churches .

Like other catalysts , enzymes do not alter the position of equilibrium between substrates and products . However , unlike uncatalysed chemical reactions , enzyme @-@ catalysed reactions display saturation kinetics . For a given enzyme concentration and for relatively low substrate concentrations , the reaction rate increases linearly with substrate concentration ; the enzyme molecules are largely free to catalyse the reaction , and increasing substrate concentration means an increasing rate at which the enzyme and substrate molecules encounter one another .

The substrate concentration midway between these two limiting cases is denoted by KM .",

  "When warfarin is newly started , it may promote clot formation temporarily . This is because the level of protein C and protein S are also dependent on vitamin K activity . Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours . In addition , reduced levels of protein S lead to a reduction in activity of protein C ( for which it is the co @-@ factor ) and therefore reduced degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa . Although loading doses of warfarin over 5 mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII , resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR , full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later . The haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation , leading to a prothrombotic state . Thus , when warfarin is loaded rapidly at greater than 5 mg per day , it is beneficial to co @-@ administer heparin , an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis , with warfarin therapy for four to five days , in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved .",

  "The 2002 Atlantic hurricane season was a slightly below average Atlantic hurricane season , officially starting on June 1 , 2002 and ending on November 30 , dates which conventionally limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones develop in the Atlantic Ocean . The season produced 14 tropical cyclones , of which 12 developed into named storms ; four became hurricanes , and two attained major hurricane status . The season officially began on June 1 , although the season 's first cyclone did not develop until July 14 . Despite the late start , the 2002 season tied with 2004 , 2007 , and 2010 in which a record number of tropical storms , eight , developed in the month of September . It ended early however , with no tropical storms forming after October 6 — a rare occurrence caused partly by El Niño conditions . The most intense hurricane of the season was Hurricane Isidore with a minimum central pressure of 934 mbar , although Hurricane Lili attained higher winds and peaked at Category 4 . The season 's low activity is reflected in the low cumulative accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 67 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so low number reflects the small number of strong storms and preponderance of tropical storms .",

  "By the end of Henry 's reign the king ceased to borrow from the Jewish community and instead turned to an aggressive campaign of tallage taxation and fines . Financial and anti @-@ Semite violence grew under Richard I. After the massacre of the York community , in which numerous financial records were destroyed , seven towns were nominated to separately store Jewish bonds and money records and this arrangement ultimately evolved into the Exchequer of the Jews . After an initially peaceful start to John 's reign , the king again began to extort money from the Jewish community , imprisoning the wealthier members , including Isaac of Norwich , until a huge , new taillage was paid . During the Baron 's War of 1215 – 17 , the Jews were subjected to fresh anti @-@ Semitic attacks . Henry III restored some order and Jewish money @-@ lending became sufficiently successful again to allow fresh taxation . The Jewish community became poorer towards the end of the century and was finally expelled from England in 1290 by Edward I , being largely replaced by foreign merchants .",

These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms , or reproduce more quickly . In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection . Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates , which can be an advantage , since these viruses will evolve constantly and rapidly , and thus evade the defensive responses of e.g. the human immune system .

Books such as the Wandering Whore and Edmund Curll 's Venus in the Cloyster ( 1728 ) are often mentioned alongside Harris 's as examples of erotic literature . Along with the anonymously written Fifteen Plagues of a Maidenhead ( 1707 ) , Garfield and Curll 's works were involved in cases that helped form the 18th @-@ century legal concept of \" obscene libel \" — which was a marked change from the previous emphasis on controlling sedition , blasphemy and heresy , traditionally the ecclesiastical courts ' province .

He was released a few months later , only to be locked up again for publishing other materials deemed offensive by the authorities . Curll 's experience with the censors was uncommon , though , and prosecutions based on obscene publications remained a rarity . Although their court action spelled the end for Harris 's List , despite the best efforts of the Proclamation Society ( later the Society for the Suppression of Vice ) , the publication of pornography continued apace ; more pornographic material was published during the Victorian era than at any time previously .",

  "Sea palms are found on the rocky shores of western North America , from as far north as Vancouver Island , to the southern central coast of California . They live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in very wavy areas . High wave action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the thallus , allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize . In addition , the constant wave action removes competitors , such as the California mussel . Recent studies have shown that Postelsia grows in greater numbers when such competition exists . A control group with no competition produced fewer offspring than an experimental group with mussels ; from this it is thought that the mussels provide protection for the developing gametophytes . Alternatively , it is thought that the mussels may prevent the growth of competing algae such as Corallina or Halosaccion , allowing Postelsia to grow freely after wave action removes the mussels .",

  "The concept of electric potential is closely linked to that of the electric field . A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force , and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work . The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point . It is usually measured in volts , and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity . This definition of potential , while formal , has little practical application , and a more useful concept is that of electric potential difference , and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points . An electric field has the special property that it is conservative , which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant : all paths between two specified points expend the same energy , and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated . The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of electric potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage .",

  "Thereafter , the hurricane began curving northward as it continued to intensify , reaching the equivalent of a modern @-@ day Category 3 hurricane – a major hurricane – by September 11 . Two days later , the storm strengthened further into a Category 4 hurricane . As no reasonably quantifiable strengthening occurred afterwards , this also marked the storm 's official peak intensity as maximum sustained winds were analyzed at 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) . However , aircraft reconnaissance estimated wind speeds of at least 140 mph ( 225 km / h ) at roughly the same time frame . The storm 's northward recurvature caused it to track just west of Bermuda late on September 13 . Afterwards , a weakening trend began as the hurricane tracked northeastward into more northerly latitudes . By September 15 , the storm had been downgraded to minimal hurricane intensity . After passing south of Cape Race later that day , the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone , and continued to track northward until it was last noted by 1800 UTC the next day near Greenland . During the storm 's twelve @-@ day trek , the hurricane tracked approximately 3 @,@ 500 mi ( 5 @,@ 600 km ) , roughly equidistant to the distance between New York and London .",

  "Resistance to the growing influence of molecular biology was especially evident in evolutionary biology . Protein sequencing had great potential for the quantitative study of evolution ( through the molecular clock hypothesis ) , but leading evolutionary biologists questioned the relevance of molecular biology for answering the big questions of evolutionary causation . Departments and disciplines fractured as organismic biologists asserted their importance and independence : Theodosius Dobzhansky made the famous statement that \" nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution \" as a response to the molecular challenge . The issue became even more critical after 1968 ; Motoo Kimura 's neutral theory of molecular evolution suggested that natural selection was not the ubiquitous cause of evolution , at least at the molecular level , and that molecular evolution might be a fundamentally different process from morphological evolution . ( Resolving this \" molecular / morphological paradox \" has been a central focus of molecular evolution research since the 1960s . )",

The Turgesh responded by launching a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana , beginning in 720 .

  "In the Early Middle Ages beer was primarily brewed in monasteries , and on a smaller scale in individual households . By the High Middle Ages breweries in the fledgling medieval towns of northern Germany began to take over production . Though most of the breweries were small family businesses that employed at most eight to ten people , regular production allowed for investment in better equipment and increased experimentation with new recipes and brewing techniques . These operations later spread to the Netherlands in the 14th century , then to Flanders and Brabant , and reached England by the 15th century . Hopped beer became very popular in the last decades of the Late Middle Ages . In England and the Low Countries , the per capita annual consumption was around 275 to 300 litres ( 60 to 66 imp gal ; 73 to 79 US gal ) , and it was consumed with practically every meal : low alcohol @-@ content beers for breakfast , and stronger ones later in the day . When perfected as an ingredient , hops could make beer keep for six months or more , and facilitated extensive exports . In Late Medieval England , the word beer came to mean a hopped beverage , whereas ale had to be unhopped . In turn , ale or beer was classified into \" strong \" and \" small \" , the latter less intoxicating , regarded as a drink of temperate people , and suitable for consumption by children . As late as 1693 , John Locke stated that the only drink he considered suitable for children of all ages was small beer , while criticizing the apparently common practice among Englishmen of the time to give their children wine and strong alcohol .",

  "At the conference in Vienna later in the year , Metternich found himself constrained by the Princes of Württemberg and Bavaria to abandon his plans to reform the German federation . He now regretted having so quickly forced through its original constitution five years before . Nevertheless , he held ground on other issues and the Conference 's Final Act was highly reactionary , much as Metternich had envisaged it . He remained in Vienna until the close in May 1820 , finding the whole affair a bore . On 6 May he heard of the death of his daughter Klementine tuberculosis . Journeying on to Prague , he heard that his eldest daughter Maria had also contracted the disease . He was at her bedside in Baden bei Wien when she died on 20 July . This prompted Eleonore and the remaining children to leave for the cleaner air of France . The rest of 1820 was filled with liberal revolts to which Metternich was expected to respond . Ultimately , the Austrian Foreign Minister was torn between following through on his conservative pledge ( a policy favoured by the Russians ) and keeping out of a country in which Austria had no interest ( favoured by the British ) .

It incorporates promotional videos shot for \" God Save the Queen \" and \" Pretty Vacant \" and extensive documentary footage as well , much of it focusing on Rotten . In Temple 's description , he and McLaren conceived it as a \" very stylised ... polemic \" . They were reacting to the fact that the Pistols had become the \" poster on the bedroom wall of the day where you kneel down last thing at night and pray to your rock god . And that was never the point .... The myth had to be dynamited in some way . We had to make this film in a way to enrage the fans \" .

The date of his birth is only an assumption , as no documents exist to prove it without a doubt ; most historians , as noted by historians Leszek Podhorodecki and Adam Kersten , accept the 1599 date , although historian Zdzisław Spieralski argued for 1604 . His father , Krzysztof Czarniecki , was a soldier who participated in several wars in the late 16th and early 17th century , and eventually became a courtier to Polish queen Constance of Austria . Whereas historian Mirosław Nagielski notes that the Czarniecki family was not well off , which limited some of Stefan 's life chances , Podhorecki points out that they owned several villages and even a small town , and the family wealth was \" not small \" .

  "Nevertheless , all this has led to the enduring image of an ineffectual leadership in foreign and military affairs under Zaoutzes . This may explain why , despite the resumption of Leo 's affair with Zoe , the relationship between Zaoutzes and the emperor became strained : tales of an alleged plot by Zaoutzes 's son to murder Leo in 894 / 895 indicate a rift between the two , and although Zaoutzes himself was not involved , a major quarrel between them ensued shortly after . Although they were reconciled , Zaoutzes 's standing seems to have declined further thereafter , as two of his protégés , found guilty of accepting bribes , were punished by Leo . Nevertheless , in late summer 898 , following the death of Theophano in December 865 or 866 and of Zoe 's first husband Gouzouniates in early 898 , Leo at last married Zoe , raising her to Augusta . In the next year , however , both Zoe and Stylianos died . Following their deaths , Leo proposed to marry yet again , choosing Eudokia Baïana as his wife .

Chief among them was Basil , Zoe 's nephew . The plot , however , was betrayed by the eunuch servant Samonas , and the conspiracy suppressed .

  "Putnam himself may be his own most formidable philosophical adversary . His frequent changes of mind have led him to attack his previous positions . However , many significant criticisms of his views have come from other philosophers and scientists . For example , multiple realizability has been criticized on the grounds that , if it were true , research and experimentation in the neurosciences would be impossible . According to Bechtel and Mundale , to be able to conduct such research in the neurosciences , universal consistencies must either exist or be assumed to exist in brain structures . It is the similarity ( or homology ) of brain structures that allows us to generalize across species . If multiple realizability were an empirical fact , results from experiments conducted on one species of animal ( or one organism ) would not be meaningful when generalized to explain the behavior of another species ( or organism of the same species ) . Other criticisms of metaphysical realism have been proposed by Jaegwon Kim , David Lewis , Robert Richardson and Patricia Churchland .",

  "Due to the heavy borrowing from Virgil , Proba 's Christ is very similar to the Virgilian epic hero , in that he is : seeking a goal that is greater than merely his human happiness , initiating a realm in which there would exist \" dominion without end \" , and projecting an aura of divinity . Proba 's entire purpose , argue Clark and Hatch , was therefore to \" imbue the Christ with heroic virtues \" akin to the Virgilian hero . She does this in three major ways . First , Proba physically describes Jesus as being remarkably beautiful , as well as having \" a magnificent and commanding presence \" similar to Aeneas . Second , Proba recasts the entire crucifixion episode so that Jesus does not go meekly to his death , but rather lashes out angrily at his persecutors .

  "In 10 – 20 % of endometrial cancers , mostly Grade 3 ( the highest histologic grade ) , mutations are found in a tumor suppressor gene , commonly p53 or PTEN . In 20 % of endometrial hyperplasias and 50 % of endometrioid cancers , PTEN suffers a loss @-@ of @-@ function mutation or a null mutation , making it less effective or completely ineffective . Loss of PTEN function leads to up @-@ regulation of the PI3k / Akt / mTOR pathway , which causes cell growth . The p53 pathway can either be suppressed or highly activated in endometrial cancer . When a mutant version of p53 is overexpressed , the cancer tends to be particularly aggressive . P53 mutations and chromosome instability are associated with serous carcinomas , which tend to resemble ovarian and Fallopian carcinomas . Serous carcinomas are thought to develop from endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma .",

GameSpot said that the DLC featured a satisfying combination of the series ' combat , stealth , and detective mechanics , and introduced interesting new enemy types that wield ice guns capable of freezing both Batman and other enemies . Reviewers described the story as entertaining , following the interesting character of Mr. Freeze , but considered it lacking in surprise because it replicates that of the 1992 Batman : The Animated Series episode \" Heart of Ice \" . The final battle against Mr. Freeze was criticized for replicating several elements of the fight against the character in Arkham City .

  "Uncertainty comes in four categories : conceptual uncertainty , evidential uncertainty , ascertainability and administrative unworkability . Conceptual uncertainty arises when the language is unclear , which leads to the trust being declared invalid . Evidential uncertainty is where a question of fact , such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary , cannot be answered ; this does not always lead to invalidity . Ascertainability is where a beneficiary cannot be found , and administrative unworkability arises when the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out . Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of resolving uncertainties , including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty , and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary .",

  "Robert was Lord Chancellor from spring 1140 to summer 1154 , serving King Stephen of England . It is not known exactly when Stephen appointed Robert chancellor nor why Stephen choose him for the office . The historian Richard Sherman speculated that Stephen appointed Robert as a favour to Walter de Gant , perhaps because of Walter 's at the Battle of Cowton Moor in 1138 . Three charters which date from March 1140 to January 1141 and are supposed to be witnessed by Robert all have difficulties with either the dating or whether the signature attributed to Robert is actually Robert , so exact dating of his term of office isn 't possible from charter evidence . For a brief period in 1141 , Stephen 's rival Empress Matilda also appointed two chancellors – William de Vere and William FitzGilbert – but they did not interrupt Robert 's term of service . Robert was with Stephen at Caistor during the middle of 1143 , where he was a witness on charters . Throughout his approximately 14 years as chancellor , Robert only witnessed 20 charters certainly and perhaps another 13 that are not securely attributed to Robert . Stephen 's two previous chancellors , Roger le Poer and Philip de Harcourt , had a much higher rate of attesting charters – 62 in 3 @.@ 5 years for Roger and 12 in 9 months for Philip . Various reasons have been put forward for why Robert attested at a lower rate than the earlier chancellors , including indifference to his office , deputising the duties to another clerk , or difficulty in following the itinerant court due to age . Robert 's last secure appearance as chancellor as a witness to a charter is one dated to the summer of 1154 at Lincoln .",

  "Measuring the magnetic resonance of crystals first involved growing the crystals , a simple procedure often done by elementary school students . The crystals then had to be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal , and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured . While his crystals were growing , Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell 's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism , which inspired an easier method . He lowered a crystal on a glass fiber attached to a torsion balance into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two magnetic poles . When it matched that of the crystal , the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal . The new method was not only much less work , it also produced a more accurate result . Rabi sent his thesis , entitled On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals , to Physical Review on 16 July 1926 . He married Helen the next day . The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles , although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan , who used the method in his own investigations of crystals .

The fourth report in the series , released in 2012 , found that little progress has been made in restoring the core of the remaining Everglades ecosystem ; instead , most project construction so far has occurred along its periphery . The report noted that to reverse ongoing ecosystem declines , it will be necessary to expedite restoration projects that target the central Everglades , and to improve both the quality and quantity of the water in the ecosystem . To better understand the potential implications of the current slow pace of progress , the report assessed the current status of ten Everglades ecosystem attributes , including phosphorus loads , peat depth , and populations of snail kites , birds of prey that are endangered in South Florida . Most attributes received grades ranging from C ( degraded ) to D ( significantly degraded ) , but the snail kite received a grade of F ( near irreversible damage ) . The report also assessed the future trajectory of each ecosystem attribute under three restoration scenarios : improved water quality , improved hydrology , and improvements to both water quality and hydrology , which helped highlight the urgency of restoration actions to benefit a wide range of ecosystem attributes and demonstrate the cost of inaction .

He found CCSVI in all patients with MS in his study , performed a surgical procedure , later called in the media \" liberation procedure \" to correct it and claimed that 73 % of participants improved . This theory received important attention in the media and among MS patients , specially in Canada . Concern has been raised with Zamboni 's research as it was neither blinded nor controlled , and additionally its assumptions about the pathophisiology of the disease may not be backed by known data . Also further studies have either not found a relationship or found a much less strong one . This has raised serious objections to the hypothesis of CCSVI originating MS. The \" liberation procedure \" has been criticized for possibly resulting in serious complications and deaths while its benefits have not been proven . Currently it is recommended not to use the proposed treatment unless its effectiveness is confirmed by controlled studies . Research on CCSVI has been fast tracked but researchers have been unable to confirm whether CCSVI has a role in causing MS.",

  "The years that Middleton was president of LSU were marked by tremendous growth , resulting in many battles over funding priorities . The four major projects being considered were a new library , enclosure of the football stadium , a new auditorium and an addition to the medical school in New Orleans . Middleton 's priorities put the library at the head of the list , and the stadium last . The Board of Supervisors , on the other hand , gave priority to the stadium , and in February 1953 voted to accept a bid for the project . After the stadium expansion had been approved , the Board of Supervisors agreed to give priority to a new library in September 1953 . Within a year , the state legislature had given LSU all of the funds it asked for , about 20 % more than the previous request , to be used mostly for higher staff salaries , but also including 3 @.@ 6 million dollars for the new library to be built across from the Hill Memorial Library in the central part of the campus .

  "On the other hand , proponents of prototype theory propose that count @-@ classifiers may not have innate definitions , but are associated with a noun that is prototypical of that category , and nouns that have a \" family resemblance \" with the prototype noun will want to use the same classifier . For example , horse in Chinese uses the classifier 匹 pǐ , as in 三匹马 ( sān pǐ mǎ , \" three horses \" ) — in modern Chinese the word 匹 has no meaning . Nevertheless , nouns denoting animals that look like horses will often also use this same classifier , and native speakers have been found to be more likely to use the classifier 匹 the closer an animal looks to a horse . Furthermore , words that do not meet the \" criteria \" of a semantic category may still use that category because of their association with a prototype . For example , the classifier 颗 ( 顆 ) kē is used for small round items , as in 一颗子弹 ( yì kē zǐdàn , \" one bullet \" ) ; when words like 原子弹 ( yuánzǐdàn , \" atomic bomb \" ) were later introduced into the language they also used this classifier , even though they are not small and round — therefore , their classifier must have been assigned because of the words ' association with the word for bullet , which acted as a \" prototype \" . This is an example of \" generalization \" from prototypes : Erbaugh has proposed that when children learn count @-@ classifiers , they go through stages , first learning a classifier @-@ noun pair only ( such as 条鱼 tiáo yú , CL @-@ fish ) , then using that classifier with multiple nouns that are similar to the prototype ( such as other types of fish ) , then finally using that set of nouns to generalize a semantic feature associated with the classifier ( such as length and flexibility ) so that the classifier can then be used with new words that the person encounters .",

  "The origin of rugby football is reputed to be an incident during a game of English school football at Rugby School in 1823 , when William Webb Ellis is said to have picked up the ball and run with it . Although the evidence for the story is doubtful , it was immortalised at the school with a plaque unveiled in 1895 . Despite the doubtful evidence , the Rugby World Cup trophy is named after Webb Ellis . Rugby football stems from the form of game played at Rugby School , which former pupils then introduced to their university . Old Rugbeian Albert Pell , a student at Cambridge , is credited with having formed the first \" football \" team . During this early period different schools used different rules , with former pupils from Rugby and Eton attempting to carry their preferred rules through to their universities .",
  "Sidon returned to its former level of prosperity while Tyre was besieged for 13 years ( 586 – 573 BC ) by the Chaldean king Nebuchadnezzar II . Nevertheless , the Sidonian king was still held in exile at the court of Babylon . Sidon reclaimed its former standing as Phoenicia 's chief city in the Achaemenid Empire ( c.529 – 333 BC ) . During this period , Xerxes I awarded king Eshmunazar II with the Sharon plain for employing Sidon 's fleet in his service during the Greco @-@ Persian Wars .",

  "The first popular rock music bootleg resulted from Bob Dylan 's activities between largely disappearing from the public eye after his motorcycle accident in 1966 , and the release of John Wesley Harding at the end of 1967 . After a number of artists had hits with Dylan songs that he had not officially recorded and released himself , demand increased for these recordings , particularly when they started airing on local radio in Los Angeles . Through various contacts in the radio industry , a number of pioneering bootleggers managed to buy a reel to reel tape containing a selection of unreleased Dylan songs intended for distribution for music publishers and wondered if it would be possible to manufacture them on an LP . They managed to convince a local pressing plant to press between 1 @,@ 000 and 2 @,@ 000 copies discreetly , paying in cash and avoiding using real names or addresses . Since the bootleggers could not commercially print a sleeve , due to it attracting too much attention from recording companies , the LP was issued in a plain white cover with Great White Wonder rubber stamped on it . Subsequently , Dylan became one of the most popular artists to be bootlegged with numerous releases .",
  "Ski touring takes place off @-@ piste and outside of ski resorts . Tours may extend over multiple days . Typically , skis , bindings , and boots allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace , as with Nordic disciplines and unlike Alpine skiing . Ski touring 's subgenre ski mountaineering involves independently navigating and route finding through potential avalanche terrain and often requires familiarity with meteorology along with skiing skills . Ski touring can be faster and easier than summer hiking in some terrain , allowing for traverses and ascents that would be harder in the summer . Skis can also be used to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow is off the technical route , but still covers the hiking trail.In some countries , organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross @-@ country skiers in wintertime . For example , the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter .",

  "The LaSalle Street canyon is home to other historic buildings including the Rookery Building , a National Historic Landmark considered to be the oldest standing high @-@ rise . A 1907 renovation included a lobby remodeled by Frank Lloyd Wright in the Prairie School style . The name rookery comes from the previous building on the property which became home to many birds , especially pigeons . The nearby Reliance Building was the first skyscraper to have large plate glass windows comprise the majority of its surface area , and One North LaSalle was for some time one of Chicago 's tallest buildings . Both the Reliance Building and One North LaSalle are on the National Register of Historic Places . Since 1853 , the governments of Chicago and Cook County have shared three different buildings at the north end of the canyon . The current Chicago City Hall , built in a Classical Revival style , was designed to symbolize the strength , dignity , and vigor of the government . Completed in 2001 , an award winning green roof was incorporated into the structure . All of the structures are designated as Chicago Landmarks .",
  "In the Quarterly Review in 1821 , the English writer and theologian Richard Whately published the most serious and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen 's work . Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare , praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative . He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre , arguing that imaginative literature , especially narrative , was more valuable than history or biography . When it was properly done , as in Austen , Whately said , imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature ; in other words , it was moral . Whately also addressed Austen 's position as a female writer , writing : \" we suspect one of Miss Austin 's [ sic ] great merits in our eyes to be , the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female characters . ... Her heroines are what one knows women must be , though one never can get them to acknowledge it . \" No more significant , original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century : Whately and Scott had set the tone for the Victorian era 's view of Austen .",
  "Nürnberg saw relatively limited service during the war , due to her commissioning late in the conflict . She participated in Operation Albion in October 1917 against the Russian Navy in the Baltic . The following month , she was engaged in the Second Battle of Helgoland Bight , but was not significantly damaged during the engagement . She was assigned to the final , planned operation of the High Seas Fleet that was to have taken place in the closing days of the war , though a major mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan . After the end of the war , the ship was interned in Scapa Flow . In the scuttling of the German fleet in June 1919 , British ships managed to beach Nürnberg and she was later refloated and sunk as a gunnery target in 1922 .",
  "In 865 the Viking Great Heathen Army landed in East Anglia , and used it as a starting point for an invasion . The East Anglians were forced to buy peace , and the following year the Vikings invaded Northumbria , where they established an obscure Northumbrian man called Egbert as puppet king in 867 . They then moved on to Nottingham in Mercia , where they spent the winter of 867 – 868 . Burgred was joined by King Æthelred of Wessex and his brother , the future King Alfred , for a combined attack on the Vikings , but they refused an engagement and in the end the Mercians bought peace with them . The following year , the Vikings conquered East Anglia . They returned to Mercia in 872 ; two years later they expelled Burgred , and Ceolwulf became king with their support . Ceolwulf was described by the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle as \" a foolish king 's thegn \" who was a puppet of the Vikings , but the historian Ann Williams regards this view as partial and distorted : he was accepted as a true king by the Mercians and by King Alfred .",
  "In the 2002 – 03 season , Fowler was transferred to Manchester City following a protracted transfer saga . Fowler initially turned down the move , and a dispute between Manchester City manager Kevin Keegan and chairman David Bernstein over whether the transfer should take place due to medical concerns resulted in Bernstein leaving the club . Following encouragement from Keegan , Fowler finally signed for Manchester City on 16 January 2003 for an initial fee of £ 3 million and a further £ 3 million dependent upon appearances . Bizarre transfer conditions meant Leeds United still paid a significant proportion of Fowler 's wages . Fowler made his Manchester City debut against West Bromwich Albion on 1 February 2003 , but made a poor start to his Manchester City career , scoring just two goals in the remainder of the season .",
  "The population is young and predominantly rural , with a density among the highest in Africa . Rwandans are drawn from just one cultural and linguistic group , the Banyarwanda , although within this group there are three subgroups : the Hutu , Tutsi and Twa . The Twa are a forest @-@ dwelling pygmy people descended from Rwanda 's earliest inhabitants . Scholars disagree on the origins of and differences between the Hutu and Tutsi ; some believe differences are derived from former social castes within a single people , while others believe the Hutu and Tutsi arrived in the country separately , and from different locations . Christianity is the largest religion in the country ; the principal language is Kinyarwanda , spoken by most Rwandans , with English and French serving as official languages . Rwanda has a presidential system of government . The president is Paul Kagame of the Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) , who took office in 2000 .
