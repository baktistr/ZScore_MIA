  "The appreciation of castles developed as the century progressed . During the 1770s and 1780s the concept of the picturesque ruin was popularised by the English clergyman William Gilpin . Gilpin published several works on his journeys through Britain , expounding the concept of the \" correctly picturesque \" landscape . Such a landscape , Gilpin argued , usually required a building such as a castle or other ruin to add \" consequence \" to the natural picture . Paintings in this style usually portrayed castles as indistinct , faintly coloured objects in the distance ; in writing , the picturesque account eschewed detail in favour of bold first impressions on the sense . The ruins of Goodrich particularly appealed to Gilpin and his followers ; Conwy was , however , too well preserved and uninteresting . By contrast the artistic work of antiquarians James Bentham and James Essex at the end of the century , while stopping short of being genuine archaeology , was detailed and precise enough to provide a substantial base of architectural fine detail on medieval castle features and enabled the work of architects such as Wyatt .",

Visual Effects Supervisor Brian Johnson , supervising modelmaker Martin Bower , and their team worked at Bray Studios , roughly 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Shepperton Studios where principal filming was taking place .

Scott then ordered it changed to gray , and the team had to begin shooting again from scratch .

  "Retaining winds in excess of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) , Cyclone Alby brought damaging winds to much of the region in and around Cape Leeuwin .

The intense winds , considered unprecedented for many in the region , were attributed to the fast movement of the storm and its location in relation to land . Moving at speeds up to 90 km / h ( 56 mph ) , winds along the northeastern edge of the storm were increased by that amount due to Alby 's clockwise rotation . It also allowed for winds to cover a large area northeast of the centre , impacting many areas far from the storm . In general , rainfall was limited and generally less than 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) ; this was due to the fast movement , as well as the asymmetrical structure with most of the thunderstorms south of the center .",

  "Garcia de Orta was responsible for building the manor @-@ house ( Bombay Castle ) in Bombay . He also mentioned several accounts of the islands and the people living in Bombay during his time .

These villages were Mahim , Parel , Varella ( Wadala ) and Syva ( Sion ) under the kasba ( chief officer ) of Mahim , and Mazagaon , Bombaim ( Bombay ) , and Varel ( Worli ) under the kasba ( chief officer ) of Bombay . In addition to these , there were smaller hamlets like Cavel , Colaba , Naigaon and Dongri , which had existed from the epoch of indigenous Hindu settlement . The Kolis , a fishing community , formed the most numerous class of people , and dwelt in most parts of Bombay from Colaba in the south to Sion and Mahim in the north . Other Hindu communities residing were , the Kunbis and Agris ( Curumbins ) ( who cultivated the fields and sowed them with rice and all sorts of pulse ) , the Malis ( who tended the orchards ) , and the Piaes ( men @-@ at @-@ arms ) ( who were Bhandaris ) . The Parus ( Prabhus ) dwelt in Mahim , Bombay , and Parel . They collected the rents of the King and of the inhabitants and their estates , and were also merchants . The Muslim Moors in Bombay were solely engaged in maritime trade . A few Muslims of less mixed descent were living in Mahim , but the bulk of the followers of Islam belonged to the Konkani Muslim community . Christians residing in Bombay during his time included eleven Roman Catholic Portuguese families of married men . The other three communities mentioned by Orta as residents in Bassein and its surrounding tracts were Baneanes ( Banias ) , Coaris or Esparcis ( Parsis ) , and Deres ( Dheds or Mahars ) or Farazes . Most Banias and Parsis did not actually settle in Bombay until after its cession to England by the Portuguese . Bombay apparently remained in Orta 's possession until his peaceful death in Goa in 1570 . Several years later , his bones were exhumed and burnt at the stake for his Jewish faith .

  "The carbon : nutrient balance hypothesis , also known as the environmental constraint hypothesis or Carbon Nutrient Balance Model ( CNBM ) , states that the various types of plant defenses are responses to variations in the levels of nutrients in the environment .

For example , plants growing in nitrogen @-@ poor soils will use carbon @-@ based defenses ( mostly digestibility reducers ) , while those growing in low @-@ carbon environments ( such as shady conditions ) are more likely to produce nitrogen @-@ based toxins . The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients .

If nutrient levels subsequently increase , by for example the addition of fertilizers , these carbon @-@ based defenses will decrease .",

  "The logical positivism movement originated in the Vienna Circle and was continued by British philosopher A. J. Ayer . The Vienna Circle adopted the distinction between analytic and synthetic statements : analytic statements are those whose meaning is contained within the words themselves , such as definitions , tautologies or mathematical statements , while synthetic statements make claims about reality . To determine whether a synthetic statement is meaningful , the Vienna Circle developed a verifiability theory of meaning , which proposed that for a synthetic statement to have cognitive meaning , its truthfulness must be empirically verifiable . Because claims about God cannot be empirically verified , the logical positivists argued that religious propositions are meaningless .",

  "The genetic heritability of Alzheimer 's disease ( and memory components thereof ) , based on reviews of twin and family studies , range from 49 % to 79 % . Around 0 @.@ 1 % of the cases are familial forms of autosomal ( not sex @-@ linked ) dominant inheritance , which have an onset before age 65 . This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease . Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes : those encoding amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) and presenilins 1 and 2 . Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42 , which is the main component of senile plaques . Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms — particularly Aβ40 — without increasing Aβ42 levels . This suggests that presenilin mutations can cause disease even if they lower the total amount of Aβ produced and may point to other roles of presenilin or a role for alterations in the function of APP and / or its fragments other than Aβ . There exist variants of the APP gene which are protective .",

  "Marriages were often the subject of careful negotiations , particularly higher in society . Marriage lost its sacramental status at the Reformation and irregular marriage continued to be accepted as valid throughout the period . Women managed the household and might work beside their husbands and , although obedience to husbands was stressed , this may have been limited in practice . Divorce developed after the Reformation and was available for a wider range of causes and accessed by a much larger section of society than in England . Because of high mortality rates widowhood was a relatively common state , and some women acquired independence and status , but others were forced into a marginal existence and remarriage was common . The elaborate funerals and complex system of prayers for the dead that dominated in late Medieval Scotland were removed at the Reformation and simpler services adopted .

  "One of the major changes from the 1370s onwards was the adaptation of the town walls to mount gunpowder weapons . At this time cannon were still unreliable , only capable of reaching relatively short ranges and required the construction of specialist gunports . Cannons fired stone cannonballs , which did relatively little damage to stronger stone walls , and so were primarily used in defence of fortifications rather than as an offensive weapon by besiegers . The first gunports in Britain were installed in the 1360s on the Isle of Wight , but Southampton was not far behind . Around 1378 to 1379 the ongoing French threat led to gunports for handguns being built into the western Arcade wall , and by 1382 the town bought its own gun . God 's House Tower was built to defend the southern quays around 1417 and the sluices that controlled the level of the town 's moats , and equipped with numerous gunports rooftop firing points , and by 1439 Catchcold tower had also been constructed , again designed to accommodate gunpowder weapons .",

The lighting and camerawork used in Andrzej Żuławski 's Possession ( 1981 ) was an influence on the film 's look . Although tenebrae / tenebre is a Latin / Italian word meaning \" darkness \" or \" shadows \" , Argento ordered cinematographer Luciano Tovoli to use as much bright light as possible . The director intended that the film be set in the near future and wanted the lighting to help create a \" cold , stark and semi @-@ futuristic look \" . Argento explained that this approach was also an attempt to imitate what he saw as the \" realistic manner of lighting \" used in television police shows . The director explained that he was adopting \" a modern style of photography , deliberately breaking with the legacy of German Expressionism . Today 's light is the light of neon , headlights , and omnipresent flashes ... Caring about shadows seemed ridiculous to me and , more than that , reassuring . \" Argento filmed half @-@ empty streets and shops where he could , in an attempt to reflect a futuristic setting where a disaster had diminished significantly the population of his imaginary city . Tovoli used Kodak 5247 film stock ( 125 ASA speed rating ) for daylight scenes , and Kodak 5293 ( 250 ASA ) for night shoots . Tovoli rated both at 300 ASA to ensure controlled overexposure of the negative during filming , for the benefit of under @-@ developing in the lab and less colour loss . The ultimate aim was for images that were \" crystal clear \" , and night that was awash with light .",

  "The song 's title was invariably seen as a statement on the demise of the Beatles , as commentators viewed the album as Harrison 's liberation from the artistic constraints imposed on him within the band . The album 's cover image , showing Harrison seated on his Friar Park lawn surrounded by four reclining garden gnomes – thought to represent the Beatles – was also viewed as reflecting this theme . While commenting that \" All Things Must Pass \" had \" accrue [ d ] new layers of relevance \" during the album 's creation , particularly with the death of Harrison 's mother , former Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer writes : \" Nobody in November 1970 could have mistaken the title 's significance ...

  "Word spaces , preceding or following punctuation , should be optically adjusted to appear to be of the same value as a standard word space . If a standard word space is inserted after a full point or a comma , then , optically , this produces a space of up to 50 % wider than that of other word spaces within a line of type . This is because these punctuation marks carry space above them , which , when added to the adjacent standard word spaces , combines to create a visually larger space .

Stevenson maintained that Madison believed strongly in the rights of the sovereign states and regarded a Supreme Court appeal as \" a remedy for trespass on the reserved rights of the states by unconstitutional acts of Congress . \" Stevenson was elected its president that year 's and his address published . Association member Richard Vaux characterized Stevenson 's presidential report reviewing state and federal legislation in 1885 as \" most interesting and valuable to the profession \" .",

  "During the 1820s and 1830s , Sherwood wrote a great many tracts for the poor ; like her novels for the middle class , they \" taught the lessons of personal endurance , reliance on Providence , and acceptance of one 's earthly status . \" Emphasizing individual experience and one 's personal relationship with God , they discouraged readers from attributing their successes or failures to \" larger economic and political forces . \" In this , they resembled the Cheap Repository Tracts , many of which were written by Hannah More .

  "From Saxon times Widnes was part of the hundred of West Derby in Lancashire .

Bulloch therefore transferred ownership to some French bankers in June 1863 , nominally on behalf of the Egyptian government , with the intention of transferring them to the Confederate flag once they were at sea . The Khedive was attempting to acquire warships , so this was superficially plausible .

As a result of these factors , Napoleon , rather than relying on infantry to wear away the enemy 's defenses , now could use massed artillery as a spearhead to pound a break in the enemy 's line that was then exploited by supporting infantry and cavalry . McConachy rejects the alternative theory that growing reliance on artillery by the French army beginning in 1807 was an outgrowth of the declining quality of the French infantry and , later , France 's inferiority in cavalry numbers . Weapons and other kinds of military technology remained largely static through the Revolutionary and Napoleonic eras , but 18th @-@ century operational mobility underwent significant change .",

  "When developing the original Naruto manga , Masashi Kishimoto had not initially intended to create Sasuke . After speaking with his editor about the future of the series , he was advised to create a rival character for the series ' protagonist , Naruto Uzumaki , resulting in Sasuke 's creation . To learn more about creating an effective rivalry , Kishimoto read a variety of manga to gather ideas on what constituted such a rivalry , and he coalesced these ideal elements into one relationship . Because Sasuke is intended to be Naruto 's opposite , Kishimoto is always careful to make sure Sasuke is never too emotional . With Sasuke 's character being that of a \" cool genius , \" Kishimoto feels he has created the ideal rivalry . By the time Sasuke suffered a drastic change in the plot which made him become one of the series ' antagonists , Kishimoto compared Sasuke and Naruto to the yin and yang as a result of their notable differences . As a result , he mentions that whenever one of the two progresses , he makes sure the other does it too . In early 2014 , he referred to Sasuke as a \" very pure person \" when asked whether he was good or evil , adding that while some of his actions such as following his clan 's ideals are positive , he tends to bring problems to others due to his self @-@ centered nature . Since the series started serialization , Kishimoto had decided the ending would feature a fight between these two characters .",

  "If Orderic Vitalis is to be relied upon , one of Malcolm 's earliest actions as king may have been to travel south to the court of Edward the Confessor in 1059 to arrange a marriage with Edward 's kinswoman Margaret , who had arrived in England two years before from Hungary . If he did visit the English court , he was the first reigning king of Scots to do so in more than eighty years . If a marriage agreement was made in 1059 , it was not kept , and this may explain the Scots invasion of Northumbria in 1061 when Lindisfarne was plundered .

During the early stages of its taxonomical study , there was some confusion between durian and the soursop ( Annona muricata ) , for both of these species had thorny green fruit . It is also interesting to note the Malay name for the soursop is durian Belanda , meaning Dutch durian . In the 18th century , Johann Anton Weinmann considered the durian to belong to Castaneae as its fruit was similar to the horse chestnut .",

  "While Dykstra 's team handled the ships , the V 'Ger cloud was developed by Trumbull . Trumbull wanted the cloud to have a specific shape to it — \" it couldn 't just be a blob of cotton , \" he said , \" it had to have some shape that you could get camera angles on . \" A special camera support track was built that could pan and focus over a 40 by 80 feet ( 12 by 24 m ) piece of art , with the light strobed to provide depth . While the team planned on compositing multiple passes to provide physical movement to the cloud shots , Trumbull felt that it detracted from the sense of scale , and so small animations were subtly introduced in the final product . The torpedo effects were simulated by shooting a laser through a piece of crystal mounted on a rotating rod after experiments with Tesla coils proved insufficient . The same effect was recolored and used for the Klingons and the Enterprise ; the aliens ' torpedoes glowed red while the \" good guys \" had blue @-@ colored weaponry . V 'Ger 's destruction of the ships was created using scanning lasers , with the multiple laser passes composited onto the moving model to create the final effect .",

  "In his notes of the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 , James Madison expressed the fear that members of Congress would create new federal jobs , or increase the salaries for existing jobs , and then take those jobs for themselves . Madison wrote that corrupt legislative actions , in the form of the unnecessary creation of offices and the increase of salaries for personal benefit , were one of his greatest concerns . The delegates who were present agreed that no member of Congress should be eligible to be appointed to an executive position while serving in Congress . Madison originally proposed a one @-@ year length on such a bar . However , Nathaniel Gorham , James Wilson , and Alexander Hamilton wanted no bar at all at the conclusion of congressional service .

  "Shortly before the game , Penn State announced tailback Bill Belton would not play due to illness , leaving Zach Zwinak to carry the load in the running game in the snow . Nebraska received the opening kickoff , and promptly went three @-@ and @-@ out , forcing a punt , which though Penn State returner Jesse Della Valle fumbled , but the Lions recovered , setting up Penn State at their own 23 yard line , but they too went three @-@ and @-@ out . Nebraska 's second drive , however , got off to a much better start , as Ameer Abdullah rushed for a 25 @-@ yard gain on the drive 's first play , but ultimately Penn State 's defense held on a later third down and short play , forcing another punt . Penn State 's subsequent drive showed promise , with Zwinak rushing for a few first downs ( on one of which Nebraska star defensive back Cionte Evans was injured ; he returned a few drives later ) , however they eventually punted , and for the second time , Alex Butterworth pinned them inside the 20 , and Nebraska failed to execute , punting for the third time ; on the punt return , Della Valle redeemed himself with a 25 @-@ yard return into Nebraska territory . Penn State took advantage of the field position , and in the waning seconds of the first quarter , Hackenberg threw a two @-@ yard touchdown to Adam Breneman after Zwinak rushed the ball six times for a total of 27 yards ; Sam Ficken missed the extra point , his first extra point miss of the season . Penn State led at the end of the first quarter , 6 – 0 . On Nebraska 's next drive , they entered with senior Ron Kellogg III at quarterback , after Armstrong 's ineffectiveness . Kellogg III came in firing on all cylinders , completing his first three passes , before Abdullah ran for a first down , and then Kellogg III completed another pass , this time for a touchdown on a 27 @-@ yard pass to Quincy Enunwa . Nebraska made the extra point , taking a one @-@ point lead . Penn State 's next drive stalled , and again Butterworth was able to pin Nebraska inside the 20 on the ensuing punt . Nebraska subsequently went three @-@ and @-@ out , setting Penn State up with solid field position at their own 37 @-@ yard line . They got one first down , and were positioned for another , but Felder dropped a pass , and Penn State 's ensuing punt was blocked after Butterworth dropped the low snap , setting up Nebraska in Penn State territory . Nebraska recorded the game 's first third down conversion en route to getting the ball in the red zone . On a snap to Abdullah from the wildcat formation , he ran up the middle , but fumbled into the end zone , and Della Valle recovered in the end zone , setting Penn State up with some momentum at their 20 @-@ yard line , however they were unable to capitalize , going three @-@ and @-@ out . Nebraska 's ensuing drive stalled , and they punted . Penn State came out trying to score before the half , and they did achieve a few first downs , but ultimately punted , and Nebraska downed the ball to go into half time leading by one . Coming out of the half , the snow showers returned , and Penn State got the ball to start the half , and they did convert a third down for the first time of the game , however again , their drive stalled , and Butterworth punted the ball for the sixth time . Nebraska faced a third @-@ and @-@ long on their next drive , and on the play , C. J. Olaniyan sacked the quarterback , and forced and recovered a fumble , setting Penn State up inside the Nebraska 10 yard line . Two plays later , with the snow increasing in intensity , Hackenberg ran a play @-@ action bootleg and rolled right , running for a 7 @-@ yard touchdown , putting Penn State up 13 – 7 , as this time , Ficken made the extra point . The lead did not last long ; Kenny Bell returned the ensuing kickoff for a 99 @-@ yard touchdown , the second consecutive week Penn State surrendered a return touchdown . Back where they started at the beginning of the half in terms of scoring differential , Penn State got the ball inside their own 20 after Geno Lewis fumbled the kickoff return ( he recovered ) . Penn State achieved a first down on the drive , but a false start penalty set up a third @-@ and @-@ long situation from which they could not recover . They punted . Nebraska also punted on their next drive , and the punt was downed at the one @-@ yard line . They did not remain in the shadow of their own goal post for long , as Zwinak rushed for four yards , and then , on a play action pass , Hackenberg threw a 43 @-@ yard pass to Allen Robinson . Two plays later , however , Evans intercepted Hackenberg 's pass , giving Nebraska good field position at their own 48 . They capitalized , kicking a field goal , going up by four . The Huskers led 17 – 13 at the end of the third quarter . On the first play of the fourth quarter , Jesse James caught a pass in the flat on a third @-@ and @-@ three , and ran down the sideline for a 46 @-@ yard touchdown putting Penn State up 20 – 17 . Penn State quickly got the ball back , and looked to milk clock with Zwinak running the football , however two incomplete passes decimated the drive , and they punted it back to Nebraska . After exchanging punts , Nebraska embarked on a drive that had a 62 @-@ yard run by Abdullah called back due to a personal foul penalty called . The foul occurred deep into the run , so Nebraska still got the ball at Penn State 's 27 @-@ yard line . Subsequently , they moved the ball into the red zone , and got it down to the one @-@ yard line before a false start backed them up to the six @-@ yard line ... one play later , they called timeout , and on the next play , Kellogg III scrambled and got to the one @-@ yard line before he and Mike Hull collided , jarring the ball loose , but the ruling was that Nebraska maintained possession , and Smith made a 19 @-@ yard field goal to tie the game at 20 . When Penn State received the subsequent kickoff , they ran the ball several times , and ultimately punted the ball away with 1 : 40 remaining from their 38 @-@ yard line ; it was downed at the five @-@ yard line , setting up Nebraska with two of their three timeouts and 1 : 31 remaining . Nebraska was backed up inside their one on third @-@ and @-@ long , and threw a long pass that fell incomplete , however Jordan Lucas was flagged for pass interference . The next series , however , was decimated by penalties , and ultimately , Nebraska punted the ball away , and the game went into overtime , Penn State 's third OT game of the season ( they won the first two ) . In overtime , Penn State got the ball first , and after failing to achieve a first down , lined up to attempt a field goal , but the typically reliable Ficken missed another kick , and Nebraska conservatively positioned themselves for a field goal try on their ensuing possession . They lined up for a 37 @-@ yard field goal , but committed a false start penalty backing them up five yards . It did not matter , however , as Smith hit a 42 @-@ yard field goal to win the game , 23 – 20 .",

Although Ivan Asen II defeated the Mongols shortly before his death , the regency of Kaliman I Asen ( r . 1241 – 1246 ) agreed to pay an annual tribute to the Mongols to avoid devastation .

  "MTBI has a mortality rate of almost zero . The symptoms of most concussions resolve within weeks , but problems may persist . These are seldom permanent , and outcome is usually excellent .

Other factors that may lengthen recovery time after MTBI include psychological problems such as substance abuse or clinical depression , poor health before the injury or additional injuries sustained during it , and life stress .

As German bands from the psychedelic movement moved away from their psychedelic roots and placed increasing emphasis on electronic instrumentation , these groups , including Kraftwerk , Tangerine Dream , Can and Faust , developed a distinctive brand of electronic rock , known as kosmische musik , or in the British press as \" Krautrock \" .

  "A third type of male was first described in 2006 ; this is a permanent female mimic , the first such reported for a bird . About 1 % of males are small , intermediate in size between males and females , and do not grow the elaborate breeding plumage of the territorial and satellite males , although they have much larger internal testes than the ruffed males . This cryptic male , or \" faeder \" ( Old English \" father \" ) obtains access to mating territories together with the females , and \" steals \" matings when the females crouch to solicit copulation . The faeder moults into the prenuptial male plumage with striped feathers , but does not go on to develop the ornamental feathers of the normal male . As described above , this stage is thought to show the original male breeding plumage , before other male types evolved . A faeder can be distinguished in the hand by its wing length , which is intermediate between those of displaying males and females . Despite their feminine appearance , the faeders migrate with the larger ' normal ' lekking males and spend the winter with them .",

The writer Louise Welsh observes that \" Live and Let Die taps into the paranoia that some sectors of white society were feeling \" as the civil rights movements challenged prejudice and inequality .

  "Pulmonary contusion and laceration are injuries to the lung tissue . Pulmonary laceration , in which lung tissue is torn or cut , differs from pulmonary contusion in that the former involves disruption of the macroscopic architecture of the lung , while the latter does not . When lacerations fill with blood , the result is pulmonary hematoma , a collection of blood within the lung tissue . Contusion involves hemorrhage in the alveoli ( tiny air @-@ filled sacs responsible for absorbing oxygen ) , but a hematoma is a discrete clot of blood not interspersed with lung tissue . A collapsed lung can result when the pleural cavity ( the space outside the lung ) accumulates blood ( hemothorax ) or air ( pneumothorax ) or both ( hemopneumothorax ) . These conditions do not inherently involve damage to the lung tissue itself , but they may be associated with it . Injuries to the chest wall are also distinct from but may be associated with lung injuries . Chest wall injuries include rib fractures and flail chest , in which multiple ribs are broken so that a segment of the ribcage is detached from the rest of the chest wall and moves independently .",

The result is a ceramic that is mainly composed of silica and alumina , with other ingredients such as quartz sand . The porosity of the brick depends on the materials and on the firing temperature and duration . The bricks may vary in color depending on the amount of iron and calcium carbonate in the materials used , and the amount of oxygen in the kiln . Bricks may decay due to crystallization of salts on the brick or in its pores , from frost action and from acidic gases .",

  "Part of the game 's concept is a balance between puzzle @-@ solving and perception , giving the player the freedom to explore The Witness 's world and creating a non @-@ linear approach to gameplay . Two of the first puzzles Blow had created involved \" clues in objects that populate the world \" , which led him to recognize he needed to create a world to support these puzzles . This would form a dichotomy between exploration and puzzle solving , which \" made a lot of sense \" to Blow . Blow created the island as open world , so that players can leave puzzles they are stuck at and work at other ones , as to avoid punishing the player for not being able to solve a key puzzle , a common issue with other adventure games according to Blow . Blow wanted puzzles to be clearly presented in the open and without any red herrings , an approach he had taken with Braid . Exploration is encouraged through the game 's narrative , which are told by audio logs the player can find on the unpopulated island ; through these , Blow attempted to create a \" feeling of loneliness in a beautiful space \" for the player . Because these logs can be found in any order , Blow hopes that each player may have a different perception of the narrative depending on how they have approached the game . Initially , these audio logs were to be more story @-@ driven , but Blow opted later to change these out for more obfuscated and obtuse information , similar to the text elements used in Braid , as to avoid directly relating out the story of the game for the player and let them think about what the narrative means instead . Blow 's team designed the narrative that those that solve more of the puzzles will gain more of a concrete understanding of the story .",

  "P. lujiatunensis , named in 2006 by Chinese paleontologist Zhou Chang @-@ Fu and three Chinese colleagues , is one of the oldest known species , based on four skulls from the lower beds of Yixian Formation , near the village of Lujiatun . While this bed has been dated differently by different authors , from 128 Ma in the Barremian stage , to 125 Ma in the earliest Aptian , revised dating methods have shown them to be about 123 million years old . P. lujiatunensis was contemporaneous with another psittacosaurid species , Hongshanosaurus houi , which was found in the same beds . It is potentially synonymous with H. houi ; Sereno ( 2010 ) , who proposed that Hongshanosaurus is a synonym of Psittacosaurus , opted to leave P. lujiatunensis and H. houi separate species due to the inadequacies of the latter 's type specimen . One nearly complete skeleton of P. lujiatunensis from the same lower beds of the Yixian Formation had previously been classified in its own species , Psittacosaurus major , named for the large size of its skull by Sereno , Zhao and two colleagues in 2007 . You and colleagues described an additional specimen and concurred that it was distinct from P. lujiatunensis . P. major was originally characterised by a proportionately large skull , which was 39 % of the length of its torso , compared to 30 % in P. mongoliensis , and other features . However , a 2013 study utilising morphometric analysis showed that the supposed differences between P. lujiatunensis and P. major were due to differences in preservation and crushing . The study concluded that both represented a single species .",

  "Shortly after his coronation , Gustav Vasa heard of the reformatory sermons delivered by Olaus Petri in Strängnäs and called him to Stockholm to have him appointed councillor in 1524 . When Petri announced his marriage the following year , the solemnity of the celebration infuriated Catholic prelates to the extent Petri was excommunicated , while the king , in contrast , gave his unreserved support . Although the king and the reformer collaborated initially , they started to pull in different directions within a few years . As the king carried out the Reformation from 1527 , Catholic churches and monasteries were demolished or used for other purposes . Petri strongly opposed the king 's methods of depriving the church of its assets and in his sermons he began to criticize the king 's actions . While both the king and Petri were thus devoted to both establishing what was to become the Swedish state and the new religious doctrine , they were also involved in domestic struggle for power , a situation fuelled by various enemies and Counter Reformation propaganda .",

Part of it includes a bridge over the city 's canal , once a part of the city 's fortification system , which was demolished in the 19th century to build the modern boulevard district . The canal is 3 @.@ 2 kilometers ( 2 @.@ 0 mi ) long and surrounded by parkland for half of its length . The earth from the demolition of the fortifications was gathered in the park and now forms an artificial hill with a cascade of waterfalls to the north of the monument . The Boulevard district east of the park is the location of several embassies and institutions , of which the closest to the Freedom Monument are the German and French embassies , the University of Latvia and Riga State Gymnasium No.1.",

  "Extremophile archaea , particularly those resistant either to heat or to extremes of acidity and alkalinity , are a source of enzymes that function under these harsh conditions . These enzymes have found many uses . For example , thermostable DNA polymerases , such as the Pfu DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosus , revolutionized molecular biology by allowing the polymerase chain reaction to be used in research as a simple and rapid technique for cloning DNA . In industry , amylases , galactosidases and pullulanases in other species of Pyrococcus that function at over 100 ° C ( 212 ° F ) allow food processing at high temperatures , such as the production of low lactose milk and whey . Enzymes from these thermophilic archaea also tend to be very stable in organic solvents , allowing their use in environmentally friendly processes in green chemistry that synthesize organic compounds . This stability makes them easier to use in structural biology . Consequently , the counterparts of bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes from extremophile archaea are often used in structural studies .",

Another is Poppaea 's aria \" Ingannata \" , replaced during the run with another of extreme virtuosity , \" Pur punir chi m 'ha ingannata \" , either to emphasise Poppaea 's new @-@ found resolution at this juncture of the opera or , as is thought more likely , to flatter Scarabelli by giving her an additional opportunity to show off her vocal abilities .",

  "With these issues , Kavanagh argues that there are likely to be consequences . Firstly , if judges replace the text of a statute with the meaning given to it by a single minister in Parliament , there is a risk that they will attribute a meaning to it which was not supported by the MPs ; interpretations , based on the views of ministers , are more likely to reflect the executive 's intention than that of Parliament . Kavanagh also suggests that it could impact on the actions of ministers ; rather than attempting to specify law through the difficult route of placing it in legislation , they can simply make a statement within Parliament about the legislation 's intent . Lord Mackay 's worry that this would increase the cost of litigation was also considered ; under Pepper , every lawyer must go through every word said in both Houses of Parliament and in the various committees to ensure that they are giving the best advice to their client . Academics have also expressed worry about the reliability of Hansard as a source ; \" the debate on the Bill is a battle of wits often carried out under extreme pressure and excitement where much more than the passage of this Bill may be at stake . The Ministers supporting it cannot be expected to act as if they were under oath in a court of law \" .",

  "Each November , the Andromedids meteor shower appears to radiate from Andromeda .

Astronomers have often associated the Andromedids with Biela 's Comet , which was destroyed in the 19th century , but that connection is disputed .

Andromedid meteors sometimes appear as red fireballs .

  "Plants also provide housing and food items for natural enemies of herbivores , known as \" biotic \" defense mechanisms , as a means to maintain their presence . For example , trees from the genus Macaranga have adapted their thin stem walls to create ideal housing for an ant species ( genus Crematogaster ) , which , in turn , protects the plant from herbivores . In addition to providing housing , the plant also provides the ant with its exclusive food source ; from the food bodies produced by the plant .

  "Between 85 and 90 percent of the Colorado River 's discharge originates in snowmelt , mostly from the Rocky Mountains of Colorado and Wyoming . The three major upper tributaries of the Colorado – the Gunnison , Green , and San Juan – alone deliver almost 9 million acre feet ( 11 km3 ) per year to the main stem , mostly from snowmelt . The remaining 10 to 15 percent comes from a variety of sources , principally groundwater base flow and summer monsoon storms . The latter often produces heavy , highly localized floods on lower tributaries of the river , but does not often contribute significant volumes of runoff . Most of the annual runoff in the basin occurs with the melting of Rocky Mountains snowpack , which begins in April and peaks during May and June before exhausting in late July or early August .",

  "The households of medieval kings were in many ways simply aristocratic households on a larger scale : as the Burgundian court chronicler Georges Chastellain observed of the splendidly ordered court of the dukes of Burgundy , \" after the deeds and exploits of war , which are claims to glory , the household is the first thing that strikes the eye , and which it is , therefore , most necessary to conduct and arrange well . \" In some ways though , they were essentially different . One major difference was the way in which royal household officials were largely responsible for the governance of the realm , as well as the administration of the household . The 11th century Capetian kings of France , for instance , \" ruled through royal officers who were in many respects indistinguishable from their household officers . \" These officers – primarily the seneschal , constable , butler , chamberlain and chancellor – would naturally gain extensive powers , and could exploit this power for social advancement . One example of this is the Carolingians of France , who rose from the position of royal stewards – the Mayors of the Palace – to become kings in their own right . It was the father of Charlemagne , Pepin the Short , who gained control of government from the enfeebled Merovingian king Childeric III . Another example can be found in the royal House of Stuart in Scotland , whose family name bore witness to their background of service .",

  "Syringomyelia ( SM ) is a condition affecting the brain and spine , causing symptoms ranging from mild discomfort to severe pain and partial paralysis . It is caused by a malformation in the lower back of the skull which reduces the space available to the brain , compressing it and often forcing it out ( herniating it ) through the opening into the spinal cord . This blocks the flow of cerebral spinal fluid ( CSF ) around the brain and spine and increases the fluid 's pressure , creating turbulence which in turn is believed to create fluid pockets , or syrinxes ( hence the term syringomyelia ) , in the spinal cord . Syringomyelia is rare in most breeds but has become widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel , with international research samples in the past few years consistently showing over 90 % of cavaliers have the malformation , and that between 30 – 70 % have syrinxes . However , most dogs with syrinxes are not symptomatic . Although symptoms of syringomyelia can present at any age , they typically appear between six months and four years of age in 85 % of symptomatic dogs , according to Clare Rusbridge , a research scientist . Symptoms include sensitivity around the head , neck , or shoulders , often indicated by a dog whimpering or frequently scratching at the area of his neck or shoulder . Scratching is often unilateral – restricted to one side of the body . Scratching motions are frequently performed without actually making physical contact with the body ( \" air scratching \" ) . The scratching behavior appears involuntary and the dog frequently scratches while walking – without stopping – in a way that is very atypical of normal scratching ( \" bunny hopping \" ) . Scratching typical of SM is usually worse when the dog is wearing a collar , is being walked on leash , or is excited , and first thing in the morning or at night .",

The Jain concept of ahimsa is very different from the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies . Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others . But according to the Jain philosophy , violence refers primarily to injuring one 's own self – behaviour which inhibits the soul 's own ability to attain moksha ( liberation from the cycle of births and deaths ) . At the same time it also means violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one 's own soul . Furthermore , the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals , plants , micro @-@ organisms and all beings having life or life potential . All life is sacred and everyone has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential . The living beings do not have any fear from those who have taken the vow of ahimsa . According to Jainism , protection of life , also known as abhayadānam , is the supreme charity that a person can make .",

An egg passes along the oviduct to the vagina where there is a chamber called the spermatheca , in which the sperm from the mating is stored . Depending on need , she may allow her egg to be fertilised . Unfertilised eggs become haploid males ; fertilised eggs grow into diploid females and queens . The hormones that stimulate the development of the ovaries are suppressed in female worker bees , while the queen remains dominant .",

  "The comuneros were strong in the central plateau of the Iberian Peninsula , as well as scattered other places such as Murcia . The rebels sought to propound their revolutionary ideas to the rest of the kingdom , but without much success . There were few attempts at rebellion elsewhere , such as in Galicia to the northwest or in Andalusia to the south . Comunidades in the south were set up in Jaén , Úbeda , and Baeza , unique in Andalusia , but with time they were drawn back into the royalists . Murcia stayed with the rebel cause , but did not coordinate much with the Junta , and the rebellion there had a character closer to the nearby Revolt of the Brotherhoods in Valencia in Aragon . In Extremadura to the southwest , the city of Plasencia joined the Comunidades , but this was undermined by the close proximity of other royalist cities such as Ciudad Rodrigo and Cáceres . A close correlation can be drawn between poor economic fortunes over the previous twenty years and the rebellion ; central Castile suffered from agricultural failure and other setbacks under the Royal Council , while Andalusia was relatively prosperous with its maritime trade . Andalusia 's leadership also feared that in the instability of a civil war , the Moriscos of Granada would likely revolt .",

With the subsequent fall of Landau on the Rhine , and Trier and Trarbach on the Moselle , Marlborough now stood as the foremost soldier of the age . Even the Tories , who had declared that should he fail they would \" break him up like hounds on a hare \" , could not entirely restrain their patriotic admiration .",

  "Classification for swimming relied on a points system to assess the severity of physical disability without considering athlete functionality specifically as it applied to the ability to swim a particular stroke . This caused problems because certain types of disability had a greater negative impact on swimming than others , and the point system did not directly address functional ability . Toto address this , in 1990 point consideration was eliminated for disability types that did not impact performance . The IPC decided to reduce the number of classifications , and to try to fix classification so that competitors could have more certainty in which classification they would compete in before attending an event . This was a major change , as previously , athletes would be classified immediately before , and even during , an event . As a result , the number of swimming classifications dropped from 31 at Seoul in 1988 to 10 at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona .",
