  "Several volcanic features in the Mount Cayley field were illustrated by volcanologist Jack Souther in 1980 , including Mount Cayley , Cauldron Dome , Slag Hill , Mount Fee , Ember Ridge and Ring Mountain , which was titled Crucible Dome at the time . This resulted in the creation of a geologic map that showed the regional terrain and locations of the volcanoes . The most detailed study of Mount Cayley took place during this period . Little Ring Mountain at the northernmost end of the field had not been studied at the time and was not included on Souther 's 1980 map . Ember Ridge at the southern end of the field was originally mapped as a cluster of five lava domes . The sixth lava dome , Ember Ridge Northeast , was discovered by Ph.D. student Melanie Kelman during a period of research in 2001 .",

  "Malotki 's critique was widely cited as the final piece of evidence in refuting Whorf 's ideas and his concept of linguistic relativity while other scholars defended the analysis of Hopi , arguing that Whorf 's claim was not that Hopi lacked words or categories to describe temporality , but that the Hopi concept of time is altogether different from that of English speakers . Whorf described the Hopi categories of tense , noting that time is not divided into past , present and future , as is common in European languages , but rather a single tense refers to both present and past while another refers to events that have not yet happened and may or may not happen in the future . He also described a large array of stems that he called \" tensors \" which describes aspects of temporality , but without referring to countable units of time as in English and most European languages .",

As circumstantial evidence , they note that no explorer reported the script prior to Eugène Eyraud in 1864 , and are of the opinion that the marks with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo .

  "Medical genetics seeks to understand how genetic variation relates to human health and disease . When searching for an unknown gene that may be involved in a disease , researchers commonly use genetic linkage and genetic pedigree charts to find the location on the genome associated with the disease . At the population level , researchers take advantage of Mendelian randomization to look for locations in the genome that are associated with diseases , a method especially useful for multigenic traits not clearly defined by a single gene . Once a candidate gene is found , further research is often done on the corresponding gene – the orthologous gene – in model organisms . In addition to studying genetic diseases , the increased availability of genotyping methods has led to the field of pharmacogenetics : the study of how genotype can affect drug responses .",

  "An important element in the emergence of a Scottish national history was an interest in antiquarianism , with figures like John Pinkerton ( 1758 – 1826 ) collecting sources such as ballads , coins , medals , songs and artefacts . Enlightenment historians had tended to react with embarrassment to Scottish history , particularly the feudalism of the Middle Ages and the religious intolerance of the Reformation . In contrast many historians of the early nineteenth century rehabilitated these areas as suitable for serious study . Lawyer and antiquarian Cosmo Innes , who produced works on Scotland in the Middle Ages ( 1860 ) , and Sketches of Early Scottish History ( 1861 ) , has been likened to the pioneering history of Georg Heinrich Pertz , one of the first writers to collate the major historical accounts of German history . Patrick Fraser Tytler 's nine @-@ volume history of Scotland ( 1828 – 43 ) , particularity his sympathetic view of Mary , Queen of Scots , have led to comparisons with Leopold von Ranke , considered the father of modern scientific historical writing . Tytler was co @-@ founder with Scott of the Bannatyne Society in 1823 , which helped further the course of historical research in Scotland . Thomas M 'Crie 's ( 1797 – 1875 ) biographies of John Knox and Andrew Melville , figures generally savaged in the Enlightenment , helped rehabilitate their reputations . W. F. Skene 's ( 1809 – 92 ) three part study of Celtic Scotland ( 1886 – 91 ) was the first serious investigation of the region and helped spawn the Scottish Celtic Revival . Issues of race became important , with Pinkerton , James Sibbald ( 1745 – 1803 ) and John Jamieson ( 1758 – 1839 ) subscribing to a theory of Picto @-@ Gothicism , which postulated a Germanic origin for the Picts and the Scots language .",

  "\" Business School \" was the second Office episode written by Brent Forrester . Forrester had previously written \" The Merger \" . The episode was the first to be directed by Joss Whedon .

In an interview featured on the third season DVD , Whedon joked that the \" Business School \" episode and his former TV show were very similar because \" Buffy [ ... ] was sad and depressing but ... it was funny .

  "After this point , an African location became increasingly popular . This may have resulted from increasing ties between Europe and Africa as 1428 saw the Kings of Aragon and Ethiopia actively negotiating the possibility of a strategic marriage between the two kingdoms . On 7 May 1487 , two Portuguese envoys , Pêro da Covilhã and Afonso de Paiva , were sent traveling secretly overland to gather information on a possible sea route to India , but also to inquire about Prester John . Covilhã managed to reach Ethiopia . Although well received , he was forbidden to depart . More envoys were sent in 1507 , after Socotra was taken by the Portuguese . As a result of this mission , and facing Muslim expansion , regent queen Eleni of Ethiopia sent ambassador Mateus to king Manuel I of Portugal and to the Pope , in search of a coalition . Mateus reached Portugal via Goa , having returned with a Portuguese embassy , along with priest Francisco Álvares in 1520 . Francisco Álvares ' book , which included the testimony of Covilhã , the Verdadeira Informação das Terras do Preste João das Indias ( \" A True Relation of the Lands of Prester John of the Indies \" ) was the first direct account of Ethiopia , greatly increasing European knowledge at the time , as it was presented to the pope , published and quoted by Giovanni Battista Ramusio .",

  "In 1206 William was in charge of the naval forces in the Cinque Ports and commanded the fleet that invaded Poitou . Whether he accompanied the fleet or stayed in England after it sailed is unclear ; according to two historians – F. W. Brooks and R. W. Powell – it is more likely he stayed . From 1206 until 1215 he was effectively commander of King John 's navy , and helped to develop Portsmouth as a royal dockyard . In 1208 William was put in charge of ensuring that no ships sailed without royal permission . That year he also oversaw the naval preparations made by the Cinque Ports . The purpose of these preparations is unknown ; the Annals of Dunstable ascribe to John a desire to oppress the Cinque Ports . During May 1208 a royal order was issued that William 's deputies in all the seaports should seize any ships in the ports that were from foreign countries , excluding Denmark , Norway and other countries that did not oppose John 's diplomatic efforts .

After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence in 1296 , English universities were largely closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant . Just over a thousand Scots have been identified as attending continental universities between the twelfth century and 1410 . Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities , such as Walter Wardlaw ( died 1387 ) and Laurence de Lindores ( 1372 ? – 1437 ) . This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413 , the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495 . Initially , these institutions were designed for the training of clerics but would increasingly be used by laymen who began to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative posts in government and law . In this period Scottish universities did not teach Greek , focused on metaphysics and put a largely unquestioning faith in the works of Aristotle . Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere .

  "McKinley was a noted protectionist , and was confident of winning an election fought on that question . But it was free silver that became the issue of the day , with William Jennings Bryan capturing the Democratic nomination as a foe of the gold standard . Hanna raised millions for a campaign of education with trainloads of pamphlets to convince the voter that free silver would be harmful , and once that had its effect , even more were printed on protectionism . McKinley stayed at home in Canton , Ohio , running a front porch campaign and reaching millions through newspaper coverage of the speeches he gave to organized groups of people who came to see him and hear him address them .

  "Although there is reference to Viking horsemen fighting in the 10th century Battle of Sulcoit , in Ireland , their primary use for horses in Britain – some of which they captured or seized , and some of which they brought with them – was to facilitate rapid travel . This is a central purpose for which horses were used in Anglo @-@ Saxon England , particularly in warfare , since conflict between the various Anglo @-@ Saxon kingdoms was carried out over long distances . In the 7th century , King Penda of Mercia , in central England , took his armies north to Bamburgh , nearly 50 miles ( 80 km ) north of Hadrian 's Wall ; and Oswald of Northumbria was killed fighting the Mercians in Shropshire .

  "Lead has no known physiologically relevant role in the body , and its harmful effects are myriad . Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes . Lead also interferes with DNA transcription , enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D , and enzymes that maintain the integrity of the cell membrane . Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes . Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis . Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system , causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins ; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is a risk factor for asthma in children . Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes . Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them .",

Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content , but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant .

  "During the 1920s , De La Rue held a series of postings at RAAF Point Cook , Victoria , and at Air Force Headquarters , Melbourne . In May 1922 , then in charge of the Seaplane Flight , he crashed an Avro 504L into Port Phillip ; his rescuers claimed that his main concern following the mishap was the state of the corduroy trousers he was wearing . He lost the RAAF 's sole Bristol Scout in another accident less than a year later . De La Rue married Clara Stone in a Presbyterian ceremony at Scots Church , Melbourne , on 1 October 1923 ; the couple would have a daughter . He had another escape in August 1925 when he crashed a Sopwith Pup into a hangar ; a witness said that De La Rue , who was \" renowned for his fiery Gallic temper \" , strode from the wreckage and began to violently abuse the aircraft . By 1926 , he was the examining officer on the flight instructors course at No. 1 Flying Training School ( No. 1 FTS ) , Point Cook .

Strang 's successful trial defense brought him considerable favorable press , which he leveraged to run for , and win , a seat in the Michigan state legislature as a Democrat in 1853 . Facing a determined effort to deny him this seat due to the hostility of his enemies , he was permitted to address the legislature in his defense , after which the Michigan House of Representatives voted twice ( first unanimously , then a second time by a 49 – 11 margin ) to allow \" King Strang \" to join them .",

  "An intervertebral disc has a gelatinous core surrounded by a fibrous ring . When in its normal , uninjured state , most of the disc is not served by either the circulatory or nervous systems – blood and nerves only run to the outside of the disc . Specialized cells that can survive without direct blood supply are in the inside of the disc . Over time , the discs lose flexibility and the ability to absorb physical forces . This decreased ability to handle physical forces increases stresses on other parts of the spine , causing the ligaments of the spine to thicken and bony growths to develop on the vertebrae . As a result , there is less space through which the spinal cord and nerve roots may pass . When a disc degenerates as a result of injury or disease , the makeup of a disc changes : blood vessels and nerves may grow into its interior and / or herniated disc material can push directly on a nerve root . Any of these changes may result in back pain .",

After the Greco @-@ Turkish wars of 1919 – 1922 Nansen travelled to Constantinople to negotiate the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of refugees , mainly ethnic Greeks who had fled from Turkey after the defeat of the Greek Army . The impoverished Greek state was unable to take them in , and so Nansen devised a scheme for a population exchange whereby half a million Turks in Greece were returned to Turkey , with full financial compensation , while further loans facilitated the absorption of the refugee Greeks into their homeland . Despite some controversy over the principle of a population exchange , the plan was implemented successfully over a period of several years . In November 1922 , while attending the Conference of Lausanne , Nansen learned that he had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for 1922 . The citation referred to \" his work for the repatriation of the prisoners of war , his work for the Russian refugees , his work to bring succour to the millions of Russians afflicted by famine , and finally his present work for the refugees in Asia Minor and Thrace \" . Nansen donated the prize money to international relief efforts .",

  "Circular calderas in the Mount Edziza volcanic complex were formed as a result of emptying the magma chamber beneath a volcano . If enough magma is erupted , the emptied chamber will not be able to support the weight of the volcanic edifice above it . A roughly circular fracture — a \" ring fault \" — develops around the edge of the chamber . These ring fractures serve as feeders for fault intrusions that are also known as ring dikes . Secondary volcanic vents form above the ring fracture . As the magma chamber empties , the centre of the volcano within the ring fracture begins to collapse . The collapse may occur as the result of a single cataclysmic eruption , or it may occur in stages as the result of a series of eruptions . These caldera collapses are relatively small compared to most other caldera collapses . The largest caldera at the Mount Edziza volcanic complex is about 6 kilometres ( 4 mi ) in diameter while most calderas are at least 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) in diameter . Volcanic eruptions accompanying these collapses produced trachyte and a white , sodic rhyolite called comendite .",

  "St. Gatien ’ s pedigree was obscure and controversial as his dam , a former carriage @-@ horse called Saint Editha , may have been covered by two stallions in the year of his conception . She was originally sent to a stallion named Rotherhill at Worcester Park , but when the covering appeared to have been unsuccessful , she was covered by The Rover , a \" stilty @-@ legged , broken down \" horse , who happened to be at the same farm . Most contemporary commentators believed that St. Gatien ’ s sire was The Rover , but it is possible that he was sired by Rotherhill . Neither stallion got any other horses of notable racing merit . The success of St. Gatien provoked interest in The Rover , who was found to have been sold for £ 50 and was standing in Ireland at a fee of three guineas . On 19 November 1884 The Rover was killed when his throat was cut in his stable at Listowel . His death was the subject of a court case the following year in which his bankrupt owner was accused of the “ malicious destruction ” of the stallion to prevent him falling into the hands of his creditors .",

  "The importance of shipping and the docks started to decline after 1886 , the year in which the opening of the Severn Tunnel caused a severe drop in coal imports by sea . The situation worsened as the railways were extended into Somerset and beyond , and ships became too big for the port . The last commercial use of the docks was when coal imports ceased on 31 July 1971 , and although they now house a marina they are currently little used . The surrounding quays have been developed for housing , although the remains of wooden quays on the riverbank can still be seen . All but a small remnant of the mump ( a huge mound of spoil from the original dock excavations ) was removed in the 1980s to make way for the development on the north side of the dock . Due to the port , ship building was also an important industry , and around 140 ships were built in the town during the 19th century by companies including David Williams , Joseph Gough , Watsons and William Lowther . F J Carver and Son owned a small dry dock on East Quay and constructed the last ship to be built in the town — the Irene . The former associated industry of rope making is commemorated in street furnishings and paving on East Quay and in the name of Ropewalk street .",

  "After the disaster at Pearl Harbor Roosevelt turned to the most aggressive sailor available , Admiral Ernest J. King ( 1878 @-@ 1956 ) . Experienced in big guns , aviation and submarines , King had a broad knowledge and a total dedication to victory . He was perhaps the most dominating admiral in American naval history ; he was hated but obeyed , for he made all the decisions from his command post in the Washington , and avoided telling anyone . The civilian Secretary of the Navy was a cipher whom King kept in the dark ; that only changed when the Secretary died in 1944 and Roosevelt brought in his tough @-@ minded aide James Forrestal . Despite the decision of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Admiral William D. Leahy to concentrate first against Germany , King made the defeat of Japan his highest priority . For example , King insisted on fighting for Guadalcanal despite strong Army objections . His main strike force was built around carriers based at Pearl Harbor under the command of Chester Nimitz . Nimitz had one main battle fleet , with the same ships and sailors but two command systems that rotated every few months between Admiral Bull Halsey and Admiral Raymond A. Spruance . The Navy had a major advantage : it had broken the Japanese code . It deduced that Hawaii was the target in June 1942 , and that Yamamoto ’ s fleet would strike at Midway Island . King only had four carriers in operation ; he sent them all to Midway where in a miraculous few minutes they sank the Japanese carriers . This gave the Americans the advantage in firepower that grew rapidly as new American warships came on line much faster than Japan could build them . King paid special attention to submarines to use against the overextended Japanese logistics system . They were built for long @-@ range missions in tropical waters , and set out to sink the freighters , troop transports and oil tankers that held the Japanese domains together . The Southwest Pacific theatre , based in Australia , was under the control of Army General Douglas MacArthur ; King assigned him a fleet of his own without any big carriers .",

  "After Weber 's immense productivity in the early 1890s , he did not publish any papers between early 1898 and late 1902 , finally resigning his professorship in late 1903 . Freed from those obligations , in that year he accepted a position as associate editor of the Archives for Social Science and Social Welfare , where he worked with his colleagues Edgar Jaffé and Werner Sombart . His new interests would lie in more fundamental issues of social sciences ; his works from this latter period are of primary interest to modern scholars . In 1904 , Weber began to publish some of his most seminal papers in this journal , notably his essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism , which became his most famous work and laid the foundations for his later research on the impact of cultures and religions on the development of economic systems . This essay was the only one of his works from that period that was published as a book during his lifetime . Some other of his works written in the first one and a half decades of the 20th century – published posthumously and dedicated primarily from the fields of sociology of religion , economic and legal sociology – are also recognised as among his most important intellectual contributions .",

  "For millennia , going back to at least the Classical period , governments have often devalued their currency by reducing its intrinsic value . Methods have included reducing the percentage of gold in coins , or substituting less precious metals for gold . However , until the 19th century , the proportion of the world 's trade that occurred between nations was very low , so exchanges rates were not generally a matter of great concern . Rather than being seen as a means to help exporters , the debasement of currency was motivated by a desire to increase the domestic money supply and the ruling authorities ' wealth through seigniorage , especially when they needed to finance wars or pay debts . A notable example is the substantial devaluations which occurred during the Napoleonic wars . When nations wished to compete economically they typically practiced mercantilism – this still involved attempts to boost exports while limiting imports , but rarely by means of devaluation . A favoured method was to protect home industries using current account controls such as tariffs . From the late 18th century , and especially in Great Britain which for much of the 19th century was the world 's largest economy , mercantilism became increasingly discredited by the rival theory of free trade , which held that the best way to encourage prosperity would be to allow trade to occur free of government imposed controls . The intrinsic value of money became formalised with a gold standard being widely adopted from about 1870 – 1914 , so while the global economy was now becoming sufficiently integrated for competitive devaluation to occur there was little opportunity . Following the end of WWI , many countries other than the US experienced recession and few immediately returned to the gold standard , so several of the conditions for a currency war were in place . However , currency war did not occur as Great Britain was trying to raise the value of its currency back to its pre @-@ war levels , effectively cooperating with the countries that wished to devalue against the market . By the mid @-@ 1920s many former members of the gold standard had rejoined , and while the standard did not work as successfully as it had pre war , there was no widespread competitive devaluation .",

  "The 14th century Huolongjing was also one of the first Chinese texts to carefully describe to the use of explosive land mines , which had been used by the late Song Chinese against the Mongols in 1277 , and employed by the Yuan dynasty afterwards .

Furthermore , the Song employed the earliest known gunpowder @-@ propelled rockets in warfare during the late 13th century , its earliest form being the archaic Fire Arrow . When the Northern Song capital of Kaifeng fell to the Jurchens in 1126 , it was written by Xia Shaozeng that 20 @,@ 000 fire arrows were handed over to the Jurchens in their conquest .

  "Like many plants in south @-@ west Western Australia , B. attenuata is adapted to an environment in which bushfire events are relatively frequent . Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire : reseeders are killed by fire , but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank , thus promoting recruitment of the next generation ; resprouters survive fire , resprouting from a lignotuber or , more rarely , epicormic buds protected by thick bark . Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber , B. attenuata is one of the latter group , with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire . It is moderately serotinous , storing only one tenth the number of seeds in its seed bank as the reseeding B. hookeriana which it coexists with on sand dunes in scrub at Eneabba north of Perth . Even then , many of its follicles do not release seed after a fire , but instead after successive autumn rains . An experiment simulating wet weather following a fire saw a series of Banksia attenuata cones with follicles subjected to twice weekly immersions in water after being heated in a ring Bunsen flame to around 500 – 600 ° C ( 932 – 1 @,@ 112 ° F ) for two minutes . Cones that had been exposed to water for more weeks had more seed released from follicles over time ; around 40 % released at three weeks , increasing steadily to almost 90 % at ten weeks , compared with a series of controls ( which were kept dry ) of which fewer than 10 % of seed released . Thus , the seed remains in the follicles until successive rains result in seed dispersal in the wetter winter ( instead of dryer summer ) , increasing the chance of survival . After the follicle is split , the seed and separator are exposed to the elements . The wings of the woody separator are hygroscopic , and move together when wet , and spread and curl apart when dry . The seed is gradually drawn out by the movement with each wetting . Once released , seed germinates at temperatures between 15 and 20 ° C ( 59 and 68 ° F ) to optimise timing with autumn and winter rains and hence maximise chance of survival . Still , many seedlings die off in the hot and dry summer months . Seedling survival for the species is lower than for banksias which regenerate by seeding over time . Despite this , the longevity of mature plants allows for maintenance of population until favourable years enable better survival of young plants . As they mature , plants are less likely to perish , and estimated to live for 300 years or more . Analyzing the seed bank and longitudinal results over fifteen years on the Eneabba sandplain showed that B. attenuata would become more abundant over time with fire intervals averaging between 6 and 20 years , peaking with intervals around 10 to 12 years , compared with longer intervals for the reseeders B. hookeriana and B. prionotes . Placed against its rivals , B. attenuata would be dominant between 8 and 10 or 11 years , but at longer intervals is outcompeted by B. hookeriana . Variability in the timing between fires allows all three species to coexist . Exaggerated good and bad weather conditions favours B. attenuata over the reseeding species , which suffer more .",

  "Feminist economists ' work on globalization is diverse and multifaceted . But much of it is tied together through detailed and nuanced studies of the ways in which globalization affects women in particular and how these effects relate to socially just outcomes . Often country case studies are used for these data . Some feminist economists focus on policies involving the development of globalization . For example , Lourdes Benería argues that economic development in the Global South depends in large part on improved reproductive rights , gender equitable laws on ownership and inheritance , and policies that are sensitive to the proportion of women in the informal economy . Additionally , Nalia Kabeer discusses the impacts of a social clause that would enforce global labor standards through international trade agreements , drawing on fieldwork from Bangladesh . She argues that although these jobs may appear exploitative , for many workers in those areas they present opportunities and ways to avoid more exploitative situations in the informal economy .",

  "Paleontologist Gregory Erickson and colleagues have studied the growth and life history of tyrannosaurids . Analysis of bone histology can determine the age of a specimen when it died . Growth rates can be examined when the age of various individuals are plotted against their size on a graph . Erickson has shown that after a long time as juveniles , tyrannosaurs underwent tremendous growth spurts for about four years midway through their lives . After the rapid growth phase ended with sexual maturity , growth slowed down considerably in adult animals . Erickson only examined Daspletosaurus from the Dinosaur Park Formation , but these specimens show the same pattern . Compared to albertosaurines , Daspletosaurus showed a faster growth rate during the rapid growth period due to its higher adult weight . The maximum growth rate in Daspletosaurus was 180 kilograms ( 400 lb ) per year , based on a mass estimate of 1800 kilograms ( 2 tons ) in adults . Other authors have suggested higher adult weights for Daspletosaurus ; this would change the magnitude of the growth rate but not the overall pattern .",

Darwin read it soon after publication , and scorned its amateurish geology and zoology , but he carefully reviewed his own arguments after leading scientists , including Adam Sedgwick , attacked its morality and scientific errors .

  "Given the depths at which it lives , the goblin shark poses no danger to humans . A few specimens have been collected alive and brought to public aquariums , though they survived only a short time . One was kept at Tokai University and lived for a week , while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days . Its economic significance is minimal ; the meat may be dried and salted , while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors . At one time , the Japanese also used it for liver oil and fertilizer . This shark is not targeted by any fisheries , but is occasionally found as bycatch in bottom gillnets and trawls , hooked on longlines , or entangled in fishing gear . Most captures are isolated incidents ; one of the few areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan , where around 30 individuals ( mostly juveniles ) are taken each year . A black scabbardfish ( Aphanopus carbo ) fishery off Madeira also takes two or three goblin sharks annually . In April 2003 , over a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan ; the cause of the event was unknown , though observers noted it was preceded by a major earthquake . The species had never been recorded in the area before , nor has it been found in such numbers since . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed the goblin shark under Least Concern . In addition to its wide range , most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught . Therefore , it is not believed to be threatened by human activity .",

  "A love poem , \" The Good @-@ Morrow \" is thematically centred on several concepts . The poem is primarily to do with evolving love ; the movement from pure lust , in the first stanza , to a nascent and evolving spirituality which liberates the lovers because they no longer \" watch each other out of fear \" but can instead see clearly . The lovers ' faith in each other allows them to be brave , unlike the Seven Sleepers , who were forced out of fear to hide their beliefs ; with love , the lovers can allow others to pursue their own dreams , accepting that \" Let us possess one world ; each hath one , and is one \" – with each other , there is no need to search further for adventure . Harold Bloom notes the intertwining of both sensual and spiritual love , arguing that Donne is suggesting that it is impossible for those buried in sensual love , \" busying themselves in mundane matters \" , to experience true love . Donne 's emphasis on the importance of spiritual love can be seen from the biblical allusions ; Achsah Guibbory states that the tone and wording of the poem is an intentional reference to Paul the Apostle 's description of divine , agapic love ; \" At moments like these ... eros merges with agape . Walls collapse , the veil parts , we know as we are known ; our deepest , truest selves exposed \" . Alfred W.

  "In 2014 , Major League Baseball introduced the Trevor Hoffman National League Reliever of the Year Award , which is awarded annually to the top reliever in the NL . Hoffman became eligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame starting in 2016 . In his debut , he fell short of the 75 percent of votes required for entry , but the 67 @.@ 3 percent he received in his first year was promising for possible induction in the future . No career reliever has reached Cooperstown on the first ballot , and only six relievers have been inducted as of 2016 . Lee Smith , the all @-@ time saves leader for 12 years before he was surpassed by Hoffman , was not inducted in 2016 after 14 years on the ballot .

Zimniuch wrote that Hoffman and Rivera are \" the best of the best of the one @-@ inning closers \" . Less than 10 percent of Hoffman 's saves were over one inning . Closers as a whole have been criticized for pitching almost exclusively in the ninth inning with no runners on base , while star relievers previously were called firemen , entering games in the middle of innings with runners on base and capable of pitching multiple innings . Saves arguably became overrated as firemen gave way to closers . However , Joe Strauss of the St. Louis Post @-@ Dispatch in 2007 proposed that 500 saves ( let alone 600 ) would be enough for him to validate Hoffman 's induction if Sutter was invited with his 300 career saves . Moreover , Hoffman might have accumulated much more than 601 saves had he played for more successful teams . During his tenure in San Diego , the Padres won at least 90 games only twice and had nine losing seasons , including five with no more than 70 wins .

  "Still distressed about Lionel , Yeats turned to Arthur Symons for companionship , moving into a room adjacent to his in October 1895 . One day while preoccupied and thinking about Maud he locked himself out for a visit just before Olivia and her sponsor arrived to visit ; as soon as she left he stayed up all night telling Symons about Maud . She arrived in London a few weeks later for a brief visit . Yeats was ambivalent about Olivia despite the advice of the sponsors ; with no money to support her , he suggested she seek a legal separation ( instead of a divorce ) , sparing her social ostracism and financial ruin . Ezra Pound biographer Jay Wilhelm suggests Shakespear knew that Olivia loved Yeats but seemed more concerned about the loss of social status in the event of divorce , causing Yeats and Olivia to decide that \" it was kinder to simply deceive him than totally abandon him \" . In January 1896 Yeats moved again , into a small flat in Woburn Place , so as to be nearer to her . Finally after a charged bed @-@ buying session , with Yeats describing \" an embarrassed conversation upon the width \" , and his nervousness preventing them at first from becoming lovers , he eventually wrote in January 1896 , \" at last she came to me in my thirtieth year .... and we had many days of happiness \" . Yeats ' happiness is apparent in the poems he wrote at that period , and for the duration of their affair , Olivia appears to have acted as a muse to the poet .",

  "The Roman conquest of Wales began in AD 48 and took 30 years to complete . Roman rule lasted over 300 years . The campaigns of conquest are the most widely known feature of Wales during the Roman era , because of the spirited , but ultimately unsuccessful , defence of their homelands by two native tribes : the Silures and the Ordovices . Roman rule in Wales was a military occupation , save for the southern coastal region of south Wales , east of the Gower Peninsula , where there is a legacy of Romanisation . The only town in Wales founded by the Romans , Caerwent , is in south east Wales . Both Caerwent and Carmarthen , also in southern Wales , became Roman civitates . Wales had a rich mineral wealth . The Romans used their engineering technology to extract large amounts of gold , copper and lead , as well as modest amounts of some other metals such as zinc and silver . Roman economic development was concentrated in south @-@ eastern Britain , and no significant industries located in Wales . This was largely a matter of circumstance , as Wales had none of the necessary materials in suitable combination , and the forested , mountainous countryside was not amenable to industrialisation . Although Latin became the official language of Wales , the people tended to continue to speak in Brythonic . While Romanisation was far from complete , the upper classes of Wales began to consider themselves Roman , particularly after the ruling of 212 that granted Roman citizenship to all free men throughout the Empire . Further Roman influence came through the spread of Christianity , which gained many followers when Christians were allowed to worship freely ; state persecution ceased in the 4th century , as a result of Constantine I issuing an edict of toleration in 313 .",

  "In England , a performance of the Piano Concerto on 22 October 1907 at the Queen 's Hall was praised for the brilliance of the soloist , Theodor Szántó , and for the power of the music itself . From that point onwards the music of Delius became increasingly familiar to both British and European audiences , as performances of his works proliferated .

  "Heat waves are a common feature of summers in the city . These heat waves place extra demand on electricity usage , leading to shortages . In extreme cases , these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic jams and protests , such as the December 2013 heat wave ( longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires ) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts , protests against the government over the lack of service , and traffic jams as a result of these protests . However , most heat waves are of short duration ( usually less than a week ) , and are followed by the passage of the cold , dry Pampero wind , which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity . Occasionally , a tornado can form , which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths . The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions . These severe storms can damage cars , houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste .",

Late the next day , Dina also passed about 65 km ( 40 mi ) off the north coast of Réunion , and although the island was in the forecast track , the cyclone accelerated to the west in the final hours and spared the island from the strongest winds . This abrupt shift in tract took place as the cyclone interacted with the high terrain of Réunion . Additionally , Doppler weather radar showed the highest reflectivity values to be 40 to 60 km ( 25 to 37 mi ) from the center . On January 23 , Dina weakened below intense tropical cyclone status while it accelerated to the southwest ; the change in movement was due to the ridge moving further to the southeast . Increased wind shear due to an approaching trough contributed to the weakening , and by late on January 23 the eye dissipated . The next day , Dina weakened into a tropical storm , after the convection diminished around the center . Late on January 24 , the JTWC discontinued advisories , and about 24 hours later , MFR classified Dina as an extratropical cyclone . The system accelerated to the southeast and was absorbed by a polar trough on January 28 .",

  "The inauspicious beginnings of Judith 's marriage , in spite of her husband and his family being otherwise unexceptionable , has led to speculation that this was the cause for William Shakespeare 's hastily altered last will and testament . He first summoned his lawyer , Francis Collins , in January 1616 . On 25 March he made further alterations , probably because he was dying and because of his concerns about Quiney . In the first bequest of the will there had been a provision \" vnto my sonne in L [ aw ] \" ; but \" sonne in L [ aw ] \" was then struck out , with Judith 's name inserted in its stead . To this daughter he bequeathed £ 100 \" in discharge of her marriage porcion \" ; another £ 50 if she were to relinquish the Chapel Lane cottage ; and , if she or any of her children were still alive at the end of three years following the date of the will , a further £ 150 , of which she was to receive the interest but not the principal . This money was explicitly denied to Thomas Quiney unless he were to bestow on Judith lands of equal value . In a separate bequest , Judith was given \" my broad silver gilt bole \" .",

  "When Philip of Hesse 's law on the protection of the Jews in his territory expired in 1538 , he commissioned Bucer to create a new policy . Philip gave him a draft that was tolerant in the regulation of their affairs . Bucer rejected the favourable conditions and recommended that Jews be prohibited from all trades except those providing minimum subsistence . His Judenratschlag also included his first use of negative stereotypes of the Jews . Philip 's ordinance of 1539 represented a compromise .

  "In 1890 , the Sherman Silver Purchase Act greatly increased government purchases of silver . The government pledged to stand behind the silver dollars and treasury notes issued under the act by redeeming them in gold . Pursuant to this promise , government gold reserves dwindled over the following three years . Although the economic Panic of 1893 had a number of causes , President Grover Cleveland believed the inflation caused by Sherman 's act to be a major factor , and called a special session of Congress to repeal it . Congress did so , but the debates showed bitter divides in both major parties between silver and gold factions . Cleveland tried to replenish the Treasury through issuance of bonds which could only be purchased with gold , with little effect but to increase the public debt , as the gold continued to be withdrawn in redemption for paper and silver currency . Many in the public saw the bonds as benefiting bankers , not the nation . The bankers ' feeling was that they did not want loans repaid in an inflated currency — the gold standard was deflationary , and as creditors , they preferred to be paid in such a currency , whereas debtors preferred to repay in inflated currency .",

  "The struggle began with the ratification of the 1868 Arkansas constitution , rewritten to allow Arkansas to rejoin the United States after the Civil War . Congress 's 1867 Reconstruction Acts required rebel states to accept the 14th Amendment – establishing civil rights for blacks – and enact new constitutions providing suffrage to freedmen ( ex @-@ slaves ) while temporarily disenfranchising former Confederate Army officers . Some conservatives and democrats refused to participate in the writing of the constitution and ceased participation in government . Republicans and unionists wanting Arkansas to rejoin the United States formed a coalition to write and pass the new constitution , and formed a new state government . In the wake of a wave of reactionary violence by the Ku Klux Klan and a poor economy , the coalition soon fractured into two factions : the \" Minstrels \" , who were mostly carpetbaggers , and the \" Brindle Tails \" , who were mostly Scalawags . This led to a failed impeachment trial of the carpetbagger Republican governor , Powell Clayton ; he was then elected a U.S. Senator by the General Assembly .",

The British finally took action , dispatching HMS Cherub and HMS Phoebe to stop the Essex . After violating Chile 's neutrality , the British captured the Essex in the Battle of Valparaíso .",
  "In 1925 , Tristan Tzara was in Stockholm , where he married Greta Knutson , with whom he had a son , Christophe ( born 1927 ) . A former student of painter André Lhote , she was known for her interest in phenomenology and abstract art . Around the same period , with funds from Knutson 's inheritance , Tzara commissioned Austrian architect Adolf Loos , a former representative of the Vienna Secession whom he had met in Zürich , to build him a house in Paris . The rigidly functionalist Maison Tristan Tzara , built in Montmartre , was designed following Tzara 's specific requirements and decorated with samples of African art . It was Loos ' only major contribution in his Parisian years .",

  "This characterisation of the Scots was often politically motivated , and many of the most hostile writers were based in areas frequently subjected to Scottish raids . English and French accounts of the Battle of the Standard contain many accounts of Scottish atrocities . For instance , Henry of Huntingdon notes that the Scots : \" cleft open pregnant women , and took out the unborn babes ; they tossed children upon the spear @-@ points , and beheaded priests on altars : they cut the head of crucifixes , and placed them on the trunks of the slain ; and placed the heads of the dead upon the crucifixes . Thus wherever the Scots arrived , all was full of horror and full of savagery . \" A less hostile view was given by Guibert of Nogent in the First Crusade , who encountered Scots and wrote that : \" You might have seen a crowd of Scots , a people savage at home but unwarlike elsewhere , descend from their marshy lands , with bare legs , shaggy cloaks , their purse hanging from their shoulders ; their copious arms seemed ridiculous to us , but they offered their faith and devotion as aid . \"",

  "\" Ysbeidiau Heulog \" is 2 minutes 51 seconds long and is in the key of B major . The track begins with an intro with a lead guitar melody , which plays twice , accompanied by drums , bass , distorted rhythm guitar and saxophone . The first verse begins on 14 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines \" Fe gawsom ni , ysbeidiau heulog , ysbeidiau heulog \" with a vocoder being used on the second \" ysbeidiau heulog \" .

  "William , Duke of Normandy , invaded England in 1066 and one of his first actions after landing was to build Hastings Castle to protect his supply routes . Following their victory at the battle of Hastings the Normans began three phases of castle building . The first of these was the establishment , by the new king , of a number of royal castles in key strategic locations . This royal castle programme focused on controlling the towns and cities of England and the associated lines of communication , including Cambridge , Huntingdon , Lincoln , Norwich , Nottingham , Warwick and York . Of the castles built by William the Conqueror two @-@ thirds were built in towns and cities , often those with the former Anglo @-@ Saxon mints . These urban castles could make use of the existing town 's walls and fortifications , but typically required the demolition of local houses to make space for them . This could cause extensive damage , and records suggest that in Lincoln 166 houses were destroyed , with 113 in Norwich and 27 in Cambridge . Some of these castles were deliberately built on top of important local buildings , such as the burhs or halls of local nobles , and might be constructed so as to imitate aspects of the previous buildings – such as the gatehouse at Rougemont Castle in Exeter , which closely resembled the previous Anglo @-@ Saxon burh tower – this was probably done to demonstrate to the local population that they now answered to their new Norman rulers .",

Sports Illustrated diagrammed each of the 11 games in its article , \" The Amazing Victory Streak of Bobby Fischer \" . Such extensive chess coverage was groundbreaking for the top American sports ' magazine . His 11 – 0 win in the 1963 – 64 Championship is the only perfect score in the history of the tournament , and one of about ten perfect scores in high @-@ level chess tournaments ever .

  "In the chaetonotidans , the excretory system consists of a single pair of protonephridia , which open through separate pores on the lateral underside of the animal , usually in the midsection of the body . In the macrodasyidans , there are several pairs of these opening along the side of the body . Nitrogenous waste is probably excreted through the body wall , as part of respiration , and the protonephridia are believed to function mainly in osmoregulation . Unusually , the protonephridia do not take the form of flame cells , but , instead , the excretory cells consist of a skirt surrounding a series of cytoplasmic rods that in turn enclose a central flagellum . These cells , termed cyrtocytes , connect to a single outlet cell which passes the excreted material into the protonephridial duct .",

  "When competing for food , eagles will usually dominate other fish @-@ eaters and scavengers , aggressively displacing mammals such as coyotes ( Canis latrans ) and foxes , and birds such as corvids , gulls , vultures and other raptors . Occasionally , coyotes , bobcats ( Lynx rufus ) and domestic dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris ) can displace eagles from carrion , usually less confident immature birds , as has been recorded in Maine . Bald eagles are less active , bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism ( although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed ) . However , the two species are roughly equal in size , aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way . Neither species is known to be dominant , and the outcome depends on the size and disposition of the individual eagles involved . The bald eagle is thought to be much more numerous in North America than the golden eagle , with the bald species estimated to number at least 150 @,@ 000 individuals , about twice as many golden eagles there are estimated to live in North America . Due to this , bald eagles often outnumber golden eagles at attractive food sources . Despite the potential for contention between these animals , in New Jersey during winter , a golden eagle and numerous bald eagles were observed to hunt snow geese alongside each other without conflict . Similarly , both eagle species have been recorded , via video @-@ monitoring , to feed on gut pills and carcasses of white @-@ tailed deer ( Odocoileus virginianus ) in remote forest clearings in the eastern Appalachian Mountains without apparent conflict . Many bald eagles are habitual kleptoparasites , especially in winters when fish are harder to come by . They have been recorded stealing fish from other predators such as ospreys , herons and even otters . They have also been recorded opportunistically pirating birds from peregrine falcons ( Falco peregrinus ) , prairie dogs from ferruginous hawks ( Buteo regalis ) and even jackrabbits from golden eagles . When they approach scavengers like dogs , gulls or vultures at carrion sites , they often aggressively attack them and try to force them to disgorge their food . Healthy adult bald eagles are not preyed on in the wild and are thus considered apex predators .",

  "Bevan suggested a political deception with the aim of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway . During the war Sweden maintained a neutral position , and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations .

Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on Sweden to end their neutral stance , one example being the requests to end the export of ball bearings ( an important component in military hardware ) to Germany . By increasing this pressure with additional , false requests , Bevan hoped to further convince the Germans that Sweden was preparing to join the Allied nations .",

  "In 1937 John Hicks published an article that incorporated Keynes 's thought into a general equilibrium framework where the markets for goods and money met in an overall equilibrium . Hick 's IS / LM ( Investment @-@ Savings / Liquidity preference @-@ Money supply ) model became the basis for decades of theorizing and policy analysis into the 1960s . The model represents the goods market with the IS curve , a set of points representing equilibrium in investment and savings . The money market equilibrium is represented with the LM curve , a set of points representing the equilibrium in supply and demand for money . The intersection of the curves identifies an aggregate equilibrium in the economy where there are unique equilibrium values for interest rates and economic output . The IS / LM model focused on interest rates as the \" monetary transmission mechanism , \" the channel through which money supply affects real variables like aggregate demand and employment . A decrease in money supply would lead to higher interest rates , which reduce investment and thereby lower output throughout the economy . Other economists built on the IS / LM framework . Notably , in 1944 , Franco Modigliani added a labor market . Modigliani 's model represented the economy as a system with general equilibrium across the interconnected markets for labor , finance , and goods , and it explained unemployment with rigid nominal wages .",

  "Todd was initially a short @-@ term villain , but his popularity with the audience and critics inspired the writers to forgo killing him or permanently sending him to prison , like most soap operas had done with rapists in the past . While keeping aspects of his personality dark or otherwise violent , they had Todd exhibit a conscience and compassion . They took steps to redeem him and made him an integral part of OLTL 's canvas , despite Howarth 's objections to a redemption storyline . With the use of literary techniques for the redemptive arc , the writers borrowed from nineteenth @-@ century melodrama and Gothic traditions , and literature such as Frankenstein . Todd became the product of an affair between his father , Victor Lord , and his mother , Irene Manning , which provided him a fortune and ties to other major characters , including his sisters , Tina and Victoria Lord . An important aspect of the character became his appearance , most notably the scar on his right cheek , which emerged as synonymous with him and served to remind him of his past misdeeds against Marty . Music and the use of humor were also key to Todd 's development . Although he formed many relationships ( including with his wives , Blair Cramer and Téa Delgado ) , and fathered children , a defining characteristic of his personality was his resistance to close relationships and sexual intimacy .",

  "Modern scholars tend to reject the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic , and as a result of miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors . Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 70 @,@ 000 – 300 @,@ 000 . These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era , the sustainability of their respective base of operations , and the overall manpower constraints affecting them . Whatever the real numbers were , however , it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea . The number of Persian troops present at Thermopylae is therefore as uncertain as the number for the total invasion force . For instance , it is unclear whether the whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae , or whether Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly .",

The same constructs of how lesbians were portrayed — or for what reasons — as what had appeared in literature were placed on women in the films . Women challenging their feminine roles was a device more easily accepted than men challenging masculine ones . Actresses appeared as men in male roles because of plot devices as early as 1914 in A Florida Enchantment featuring Edith Storey . In Morocco ( 1930 ) Marlene Dietrich kisses another woman on the lips , and Katharine Hepburn plays a man in Christopher Strong in 1933 and again in Sylvia Scarlett ( 1936 ) .

  "Later , diplodocids were often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air , allowing them to graze from tall trees . Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal , rather than vertical , and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level . A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position . However , a 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal , alert posture , and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown , unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals . One of the sauropod models in this study was Diplodocus , which they found would have held its neck at about a 45 ° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture .",
