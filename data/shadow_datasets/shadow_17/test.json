  "Calcium oxalate is a common crystalline compound found in many fungi , including the earthstars . The presence of calcium oxalate crystals — apparent as a whitish powder on the surface of the spore sac — has been verified for G. pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy . The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form , known as weddellite . A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening ( dehiscence ) of the outer peridial layers . The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls , pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the peridium .",

  "Besides the clinical observations that drugs that increase the amount of available monoamines are effective antidepressants , advances in psychiatric genetics indicate that phenotypic variation in central monoamine function may be marginally associated with vulnerability to depression . Despite these findings , the cause of depression is not simply monoamine deficiency . In the past two decades , research has revealed multiple limitations of the monoamine hypothesis , and its explanatory inadequacy has been highlighted within the psychiatric community . A counterargument is that the mood @-@ enhancing effect of MAO inhibitors and SSRIs takes weeks of treatment to develop , even though the boost in available monoamines occurs within hours . Another counterargument is based on experiments with pharmacological agents that cause depletion of monoamines ; while deliberate reduction in the concentration of centrally available monoamines may slightly lower the mood of unmedicated depressed patients , this reduction does not affect the mood of healthy people . The monoamine hypothesis , already limited , has been further oversimplified when presented to the public as a mass marketing tool , usually phrased as a \" chemical imbalance \" .",

Black Star was followed by a second fragrance in July 2010 , Forbidden Rose , which took two years to develop . It features notes of red apple , winepeach , black pepper , lotusflower , heliotrope , shellflower , praline agreement , sandalwood , and vanilla . Its message is an extension of Black Star 's \" follow your dreams \" , though the tagline for the new perfume is \" Dare to Discover \" . The commercial takes place in a gothic garden setting , where Lavigne , upon entering the garden , finds a single , purple rose . Lavigne launched a third fragrance , Wild Rose , in August 2011 and filmed the commercial for it in late 2010 . The tagline for the fragrance is \" Dare to discover more \" . It features notes of mandarin , pink grapefruit , plum , orange blossom , frangipani , blue orchid , musk , sandalwood and crème brûlée .",

  "Michael Kennedy characterises Vaughan Williams 's music as a strongly individual blending of the modal harmonies familiar from folk ‐ song with the French influence of Ravel and Debussy . The basis of his work is melody , his rhythms , in Kennedy 's view , being unsubtle at times . Vaughan Williams 's music is often described as visionary ; Kennedy cites the masque Job and the Fifth and Ninth Symphonies . Vaughan Williams 's output was prolific and wide ranging . For the voice he composed songs , operas , and choral works ranging from simpler pieces suitable for amateurs to demanding works for professional choruses . His comparatively few chamber works are not among his better known compositions . Some of his finest works elude conventional categorisation , such as the Serenade to Music ( 1938 ) for sixteen solo singers and orchestra ; Flos Campi ( 1925 ) for solo viola , small orchestra , and small chorus ; and his most important chamber work , in Howes 's view — not purely instrumental but a song cycle — On Wenlock Edge ( 1909 ) with accompaniment for string quartet and piano .",

' He called attention to the disregard with which ' an unrestrained majority ' had received the memorials and protests of some of the ' sovereign states , ' justifying their acts by precedent and expediency and thus melting away ' the solder of the Federal chain ; ' also to the fact that it was then ' strongly insinuated ' that the states could not ' interpose to arrest an unconstitutional measure .

First , the concept that the 1960 act \" carved out \" the buildings used by the government goes against the plain language of the statute . Second , the fact that the statute does not explicitly state that the government is subject to monetary damages is also without merit . Souter noted that , were the court to accept that reasoning , it would require that the court to overturn Mitchell II , which it was not prepared to do . Instead , the court will continue to use a \" fair inference \" from the law to determine if damages are authorized . Finally , the United States argued that the only appropriate relief would be injunctive relief instead of damages .

  "The capsizing of the battleship Novorossiysk in Sevastopol harbor on 29 October 1955 delayed salvage operations on Stalingrad until the end of the year . The hull had to be patched , the water pumped out and all the projections removed to raise the stern slightly with pontoons , pivot into deeper water , then trim it down to elevate the bow off the bottom and pull it free . These preparations were very time @-@ consuming and it wasn 't until mid @-@ July 1956 that it could be pulled off the rocks into Sevastopol harbor where she was given more permanent repairs . She was then moved to the Naval Firing Range between Yevpatoria and Sevastopol where it was used as a target for seven P @-@ 1 or KSS anti @-@ ship missiles fired from the converted Sverdlov @-@ class cruiser Admiral Nakhimov in December 1956 . The missiles penetrated the upper and main decks and devastated the upper hull , but there was no appreciable change in the ship 's draught .

The Austrian attacks were slow , uncoordinated , and easily repulsed by the experienced French III Corps . Napoleon knew there was fighting in Davout 's sector and had already devised a new strategy that he hoped would beat the Austrians : while the Austrians attacked to the north , Masséna 's corps , later augmented by Oudinot 's forces , would strike southeast towards Freising and Landshut in hopes of rolling up the entire Austrian line and relieving the pressure on Davout . Napoleon was reasonably confident that the joint corps of Davout and Lefebvre could pin the Austrians while his other forces swept the Austrian rear .",
  "The first bridge across the Ontonagon River was built in 1891 . It was heavily damaged after a fire in the village a few years later . This bridge was deemed inadequate for the needs of traffic in Ontonagon in the 1930s . The Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) contracted for a replacement span in 1939 . A temporary crossing was used while the original span was demolished and replaced with a swing bridge . This style of bridge was popular with the department in the first half of the 20th century , but fell out of favor as the MSHD transitioned to bascule bridges . Because of this change , the Ontonagon River Bridge was the last of its type built in the state when it was completed in 1940 .",

  "Some development of the navigation occurred .

There was a long @-@ running dispute with Arthur Ingram , who owned Knottingley mill , which started in 1731 , and was not finally resolved until 1776 , when the company bought both of Ingram 's mills . Despite this , the general profitability of the navigation led the undertakers to be complacent about its development . They asked John Smeaton to suggest improvements in 1771 , but the subsequent attempt to authorise such improvements was disputed in Parliament on the basis that the present navigation was totally inadequate . The recently finished Calder and Hebble Navigation proposed to build a canal from Wakefield to the Dutch River , which would bypass the Calder completely , and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal supported a Leeds to Selby canal , which would bypass the Aire . During 1772 , they asked Smeaton to survey a route to avoid the lower Aire , but his assistant , William Jessop actually carried out the work .

  "The meeting , moved to Wittenberg because Luther was ill , began on 21 May 1536 . To the surprise of the south Germans , Luther began by attacking them , demanding that they recant their false understanding of the eucharist . Capito intervened to calm matters , and Bucer claimed that Luther had misunderstood their views on the issue . The Lutherans insisted that unbelievers who partake of the eucharist truly receive the body and blood of Christ . Bucer and the south Germans believed that they receive only the elements of the bread and the wine . Johannes Bugenhagen formulated a compromise , approved by Luther , that distinguished between the unworthy ( indigni ) and the unbelievers ( impii ) . The south Germans accepted that the unworthy receive Christ , and the question of what unbelievers receive was left unanswered . The two sides then worked fruitfully on other issues and on 28 May signed the Wittenberg Concord . Strasbourg quickly endorsed the document , but much coaxing from Bucer was required before he managed to convince all the south German cities . The Swiss cities were resistant , Zürich in particular . They rejected even a mild statement suggesting a union of Christ with the elements of the eucharist . Bucer advised the Swiss to hold a national synod to decide on the matter , hoping he could at least persuade Bern and Basel . The synod met in Zürich from 28 May to 4 April 1538 , but Bucer failed to win over a single city . The Swiss never accepted or rejected the Wittenberg Concord .",

This demand , so directly opposed to that liberal spirit of the world , to which I was more and more tending , did not have the best effect upon me . All unsuccessful attempts at conversion leave him who has been selected for a proselyte stubborn and obdurate , and this was especially the case with me when Lavater at last came out with the hard dilemma- Either Christian or Atheist ! Upon this I declared that if he would not leave me my own Christianity as I had hitherto cherished it , I could readily decide for Atheism , particularly as I saw that nobody knew precisely what either meant .",

Doré , illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862 , retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait , but gave the Baron a healthier and more affable appearance ; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character .",

The French were clustered together in support of Néréide , whose crew were attempting to make hasty repairs while the squadron limped in a northwesterly direction towards Madagascar . Following the French lights , Schomberg pursued the French in the darkness and when Clorinde lost a man overboard and stopped to rescue him at 21 : 50 , Roquebert was forced to fall back and protect his consort from being overwhelmed . Steering Renommée directly at Astraea , Roquebert opened fire at close range but was soon surrounded , with Astraea on one side , Racehorse on the other and Phoebe raking her stern . In a ferocious 25 minute engagement , Roquebert was killed and the French flagship suffered severe damage , surrendering after a shot from Racehorse ignited her mainsail . The British ships were also badly damaged : Racehorse was unable to launch a boat to take possession of Renommée due to a fallen topmast on her deck and Astraea 's boats all badly damaged by shot and leaked severely during the short row to the stricken French vessel .",

  "The sky bears overt metaphorical significance and is the centrepiece of the painting 's symbolism . Alexander , identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun , finds his victory in the sun 's rays ; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon , a symbol of the Near East . Considered in terms of the painting 's contemporary context , the sun 's triumph over the moon represents Christendom 's victory over the Islamism of the Ottomans . Eschatological meaning , probably inspired by prophecies in the Book of Daniel , is imbued in the heavenly setting . In particular , Daniel 7 predicts the rise and fall of four kingdoms before the Second Coming ; these were thought to be Babylon , Persia , Greece , and Rome at the time of the painting 's creation . Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece , and thus as an event of cosmic significance . The battle also marked a progression toward the end of the world – an important theological concern in the 16th century , given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the papacy . As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic , Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and was surely aware of this trend of eschatological thought . Schedel , too , had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh . It may therefore be inferred that the sky 's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well .",

However , their base camp was cut off from the continent 's interior by high mountain ranges , and journeys along the coastline were frustrated by unsafe sea ice . These factors severely restricted the extent of their exploration , which was largely confined to the vicinity of Robertson Bay .

  "Allied supply was entirely by sea . Amphibian scouts from the US 532nd Engineer Boat and Shore Regiment ( EBSR ) of the US 2nd Engineer Special Brigade , wearing Australian uniforms , advanced with the infantry and reconnoitred beaches from the landward side as they were secured . If a beach looked suitable , a second reconnaissance was made from the sea . Once a beach was selected , a shore party was brought in by landing craft to set up an administrative area . Engineers improved the coastal track to enable supplies to units moving along it to be brought up by jeeps but supplies for units moving inland over the high ground had to be brought by native carriers . Artillery guns were brought forward over the tracks , or else were moved by Landing Craft Mechanised ( LCMs ) of the 532nd EBSR . Tanks normally moved along the tracks but used LCMs to bypass obstacles . As the advance continued , new beachheads were opened up while rearward ones were closed . The advance was halted on occasion to allow for the guns to be brought forward or sufficient supplies to be accumulated at the forward beachhead .",

The sale of one of Hawaii 's harbors was proposed by Charles Reed Bishop , a foreigner who had married into the Kamehameha family , had risen in the government to be Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs , and owned a country home near Pu 'uloa . He showed the two U.S. officers around the lochs , although his wife , Bernice Pauahi Bishop , privately disapproved of selling Hawaiian lands . As monarch , William Charles Lunalilo , was content to let Bishop run almost all business affairs but the ceding of lands would become unpopular with the native Hawaiians . Many islanders thought that all the islands , rather than just Pearl Harbor , might be lost and opposed any cession of land . By November 1873 , Lunalilo canceled negotiations and returned to drinking , against his doctor 's advice ; his health declined swiftly , and he died on February 3 , 1874 .",

  "The earliest breeding of the ancestors of the Cleveland Bay was done in large part by English churches and monasteries , to meet a need for pack horses to carry trade goods between abbeys and monasteries in northeast England . These medieval horses gained the nickname of \" Chapman Horses \" because of their use by travelling merchants known as \" chapmen \" . What is now the Cleveland Bay was developed from Barb and Andalusian horses crossed with Chapman Horse mares . The Barb blood came mainly from horses imported by wealthy young men on their Grand Tour of Europe , bought off the docks in Marseilles and transported back to England . The Andalusian blood came from horses bred at the royal stud in Cordoba and given to English royalty by the King of Spain . The stallions were often available for breeding to local horses , and the first infusion of Andalusian blood was added to the native Chapman Horses . The Spanish horses also made their way to the outlying estates of English nobility , and were then taken by Oliver Cromwell 's men after the English Civil War . Once in the hands of Cromwell 's men , many of the stallions were made available for locals to cross with the existing Chapman Horses , adding a second infusion of Andalusian bloodlines . In the late 17th century a second infusion of Barb blood was added when Cleveland breeders purchased horses directly from soldiers at Tangier or from the Moors themselves .",

  "Grand Theft Auto V was envisioned to improve the core mechanics of the Grand Theft Auto series by giving the player three lead protagonists to switch between . The team 's main motivation for including three protagonists was for Grand Theft Auto V to innovate game storytelling and to prevent the series from feeling stale by not evolving the core structure of the gameplay . Houser said , \" We didn 't want to do the same thing over again \" . The concept of having three interconnected protagonists was devised during the development of San Andreas , but the team felt they did not have the technical capabilities to realise it . Garbut explained , \" It didn 't work from a tech point of view because the three characters need three times as much memory , three types of animation , and so on \" . After the release of Grand Theft Auto IV , the team developed episodic content packages , The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony ( both 2009 ) , each of which introduced a new protagonist . The three interwoven stories had a positive critical reception and confirmed the team 's confidence that building Grand Theft Auto V around this model was an innovative decision .",

The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon , along with every other Phoenician city . These payments stimulated Sidon 's search for new means of provisioning and furthered Phoenician emigration and expansion , which peaked in the 8th century BC . When Assyrian king Sargon II died in 705 BC , the Sidonian king Luli joined with the Egyptians and Judah in an unsuccessful rebellion against Assyrian rule , but was forced to flee to Kition ( modern Larnaca in Cyprus ) with the arrival of the Assyrian army headed by Sennacherib , Sargon II 's son and successor .

The Chinese astronomer Shi Shen ( fl . 4th century BC ) gave instructions for predicting solar and lunar eclipses . Later , the physical form of the Moon and the cause of moonlight became understood . The ancient Greek philosopher Anaxagoras ( d . 428 BC ) reasoned that the Sun and Moon were both giant spherical rocks , and that the latter reflected the light of the former . Although the Chinese of the Han Dynasty believed the Moon to be energy equated to qi , their ' radiating influence ' theory also recognized that the light of the Moon was merely a reflection of the Sun , and Jing Fang ( 78 – 37 BC ) noted the sphericity of the Moon . In the 2nd century AD Lucian wrote a novel where the heroes travel to the Moon , which is inhabited . In 499 AD , the Indian astronomer Aryabhata mentioned in his Aryabhatiya that reflected sunlight is the cause of the shining of the Moon .

  "Stelae have become threatened in modern times by plundering for sale on the international art market . Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact . Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport , including power saws , chisels , acid and heat . When a monument is well preserved , the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport . Even when successful , this results in damage to inscriptions on the sides of the stela . At worst , this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale . Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by American museums and private collectors in the past . When such monuments are removed from their original context , their historical meaning is lost . Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution , no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location . After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the New York art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen pre @-@ Columbian sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date .

Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade ; Cedric and his family had \" a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs \" with a history of philanthropy . When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands , where he was given a musical upbringing . From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool , conducted mostly by Hans Richter . He was educated at Westminster School in London , where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by , among others , Sir Henry Wood , Claude Debussy , Arthur Nikisch , Fritz Steinbach , and Richard Strauss . His biographer , Michael Kennedy , writes , \" Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908 , when he went up to Christ Church , Oxford . \" While still a schoolboy , Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster , a family friend .",
  "Zajdel 's early works , from 60s and early 70s , can be located in the Cambellian , classic science fiction genre , focusing on scientific inventions and their role in space exploration , alien contact or artificial intelligence . As his writing career continued , however , his stories evolved to focus on the social aspects and often negative consequences of those inventions . Over time , an increasingly visible theme became visible in his works - a concern over dangers inherent in attempts to control the human society . He is also condemning human ignorance , warning against xenophobia , and asking philosophical questions about the nature of the universe , happiness and human destiny . Zajdel 's most important works are from his second period - late 70s and 80s - and represent the genres of social and dystopian fiction . In his works , he envisions totalitarian states and societies leaving under extreme forms of mass surveillance .",

Because of this , the Tropical rain belt may not have risen to its northern latitudes , thus causing an absence of seasonal rains . This claim is not universally accepted and is very difficult to test . However a 2009 Chinese study of 50 years of continuous data found that , though most parts of eastern China saw no significant change in the amount of water held by the atmosphere , light rains had decreased . The researchers then modeled the effect of aerosols and also concluded the overall effect was that water drops in polluted cases are up to 50 percent smaller than in pristine skies . They concluded smaller size impedes the formation of rain clouds , and the falling of light rain is beneficial for agriculture . This was a different effect than reducing solar irradiance , but still a direct result from the presence of aerosols .",

  "Oxidative phosphorylation works by using energy @-@ releasing chemical reactions to drive energy @-@ requiring reactions : The two sets of reactions are said to be coupled . This means one cannot occur without the other . The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain , from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen , is an exergonic process – it releases energy , whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process , which requires an input of energy . Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane , and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane , in a process called chemiosmosis . In practice , this is like a simple electric circuit , with a current of protons being driven from the negative N @-@ side of the membrane to the positive P @-@ side by the proton @-@ pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain . These enzymes are like a battery , as they perform work to drive current through the circuit . The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane , which is often called the proton @-@ motive force . It has two components : a difference in proton concentration ( a H + gradient , ΔpH ) and a difference in electric potential , with the N @-@ side having a negative charge .",

Combat on the outskirts of Lazarevac intensified once again as a result , and the Serbian Army managed to repulse every Austro @-@ Hungarian assault despite a lack of ammunition . The Serbs quickly began to run out of shells and Stepanović asked the Serbian Supreme Command that the artillery of the 2nd Army be redirected to its rear , as he felt that its failure to contribute to the defense of Lazarevac frustrated his troops and was bad for morale . Putnik instructed Stepanović to keep the artillery of the 2nd Army on the front and told him that the Russians had sent artillery shells for its guns . Stepanović was skeptical that the Russians had sent supplies to the Serbs , but kept the artillery of the 2nd Army on the front line as Putnik had instructed .",

  "In the fourth chapter , entitled \" The Prehistoric World of Anthropophagy \" , Arens deals with archaeological arguments for socially approved cannibalism in European and North American prehistory . He argues that many early archaeologists , in viewing prehistoric societies as \" primitive \" and \" savage \" , expected to find widespread evidence of cannibalism within the archaeological record , just as social anthropologists were claiming that the practice was widespread in recently documented \" primitive \" , \" savage \" societies . He critiques various claims that broken bones represent evidence of cannibalism , both in Iron Age Yorkshire and in the case of Peking Man , maintaining that these breakages could represent many different things rather than cannibalism . He then moves on to look at North American examples , including those from the Pueblo period in the Southwestern United States and among the Iroquois in the country 's northeast , in both instances critiquing an interpretation of socially sanctioned cannibalism .",

  "Scotland is known for its dramatically placed castles , many of which date from the late medieval era . In contrast to England , where the wealthy began to move towards more comfortable grand houses , these continued to be built into the modern period , developing into the style of Scottish Baronial architecture in the 19th century , popular amongst the minor aristocracy and merchant class . This building type , often built with defence in mind in the form of the tower house , was characterised by corbelled turrets and crow @-@ stepped gables marked the first uniquely Scottish mode of building . Ceilings of these houses were decorated with vividly coloured painting on boards and beams , using emblematic motifs from European pattern books or the artist 's interpretation of trailing grotesque patterns .

The main criterion used to discern historical details in the \" third quest \" is the criterion of plausibility , relative to Jesus ' Jewish context and to his influence on Christianity .

A portrait painted of him which appears to be of a man 20 years younger , is according to Stirling \" no flattering likeness \" , but instead completely accurate .

  "The festive kindling of the badnjak commemorates the fire that — according to Serbian folk tradition — the shepherds of Bethlehem built in the cave where Jesus Christ was born , to warm the Baby Jesus and his mother throughout the night . The badnjak may also be seen as a symbol of the cross upon which Christ was crucified , the warmth of its fire symbolizing the salvation which , in the Christian belief , the crucifixion made possible for mankind . Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the old Slavic religion . They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation , and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn , to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields , the health and happiness of the family .

  "Highlighting Ion Creangă 's recourse to the particularities of Moldavian regionalisms and archaisms , their accumulation making Creangă 's work very difficult to translate , George Călinescu reacted against claims that the narratives reflected antiquating patterns . He concluded that , in effect , Creangă 's written language was the equivalent of a \" glossological museum \" , and even contrasted by the writer 's more modern everyday parlance . Also discussing the impression that Creangă 's work should be read with a Moldavian accent , noted for its \" softness of sound \" in relation to standard Romanian phonology , Călinescu cautioned against interpretative exaggerations , maintaining that the actual texts only offer faint suggestions of regional pronunciation . Contrasting Creangă with the traditions of literature produced by Wallachians in what became the standard literary language , Călinescu also argued in favor of a difference in mentality : the \" balance \" evidenced by Moldavian speech and illustrated in Ion Creangă 's writings is contrasted by the \" discoloration and roughness \" of \" Wallachianism \" . He also criticized those views according to which Creangă 's variant of the literary language was \" beautiful \" , since it failed to \" please everyone on account of some acoustical beauty \" , and since readers from outside the writer 's native area could confront it \" with some irritation . \" For Călinescu , the result nevertheless displays \" an enormous capacity of authentic speech \" , also found in the works of Caragiale and , in the 20th century , Mihail Sadoveanu . According to the same commentator , the dialectical interventions formed a background to a lively vocabulary , a \" hermetic \" type of \" argot \" , which contained \" hilarious double entendres and indecent onomatopoeia \" , passing from \" erudite beauty \" to \" obscene laughter \" . Some of the expressions characteristic of Creangă 's style are obscure in meaning , and some other , such as \" drought made the snake scream inside the frog 's mouth \" , appear to be spontaneous and nonsensical . Another specific trait of this language , commented upon by Vianu 's and compared by him to the aesthetics of Classicism , sees much of Creangă 's prose being set to a discreet poetic meter .",

  "Fernandez , Garfinkel & Arbiol ( 1998 ) use undirected bottleneck shortest paths in order to form composite aerial photographs that combine multiple images of overlapping areas . In the subproblem to which the widest path problem applies , two images have already been transformed into a common coordinate system ; the remaining task is to select a seam , a curve that passes through the region of overlap and divides one of the two images from the other . Pixels on one side of the seam will be copied from one of the images , and pixels on the other side of the seam will be copied from the other image . Unlike other compositing methods that average pixels from both images , this produces a valid photographic image of every part of the region being photographed . They weight the edges of a grid graph by a numeric estimate of how visually apparent a seam across that edge would be , and find a bottleneck shortest path for these weights . Using this path as the seam , rather than a more conventional shortest path , causes their system to find a seam that is difficult to discern at all of its points , rather than allowing it to trade off greater visibility in one part of the image for lesser visibility elsewhere .",

Later on , poets and writers took up the theme and turned it into an iconography that exalted Elizabeth . Public tributes to the Virgin by 1578 acted as a coded assertion of opposition to the queen 's marriage negotiations with the Duke of Alençon .",
  "Before marriage , girls made dedications to Artemis , often of childhood toys and locks of hair . Along with Artemis , girls made pre @-@ marital sacrifices to Gaia and Uranus , the Erinyes and Moirai , and to their ancestors . It was customary for the bride to bathe before her wedding ; jars called loutrophoroi were used to draw the water , and many of these were afterwards dedicated to nymphs . For instance , at a shrine to a nymph on the south slope of the Acropolis in Athens , many fragments of loutrophoroi have been discovered with the word Nymphe inscribed on them .",

  "The critique that Belldandy represents a negative stereotype of women , placing them in a subservient role to men , appears a number of times in the literature . Annalee Newitz states that the manner in which Belldandy is portrayed in the series would , in all likelihood , be impossible in the United States — especially , as she goes on to say , since \" the advent of feminism and the women 's rights movement \" . While Newitz sees this as reflective of Japanese culture , arguing that characters such as Belldandy are possible because feminist issues do not have the same recognition within Japan as they do in many Western countries , Susan J. Napier takes a very different line . She argues that characters such as Belldandy may be a reaction to the increasing assertiveness of women in Japan , thus presenting Belldandy as an attempt to reinforce traditional cultural values , rather than a reflection of them . To demonstrate this , Napier points to Belldandy 's role in \" Moonlight and Cherry Blossoms \" , the first of the OVA episodes . The episode begins with disorder , as Keiichi is evicted from his dorm after Belldandy 's chaotic appearance into his life , but ends with a return to \" traditional values \" , signified through the restoration of the old temple .

  "Through his involvement with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick , general manager of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London ( UERL ) . Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport , but this would change through his collaboration with Pick . In 1923 , Pick commissioned Holden to design a façade for a side entrance at Westminster tube station . This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL 's pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition . Also in 1924 , Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway ( now part of the Northern line ) from Clapham Common to Morden . The designs replaced a set by the UERL 's own architect , Stanley Heaps , which Pick had found unsatisfactory . The designs reflect the simple modernist style he was using in France for the war cemeteries ; double @-@ height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen , each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations . The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three @-@ dimensional version of the roundel . Holden also advised Heaps on new façades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway .",

  "Electrode selection is based primarily on the composition of the metal being welded , the process variation being used , joint design and the material surface conditions . Electrode selection greatly influences the mechanical properties of the weld and is a key factor of weld quality . In general the finished weld metal should have mechanical properties similar to those of the base material with no defects such as discontinuities , entrained contaminants or porosity within the weld . To achieve these goals a wide variety of electrodes exist . All commercially available electrodes contain deoxidizing metals such as silicon , manganese , titanium and aluminum in small percentages to help prevent oxygen porosity . Some contain denitriding metals such as titanium and zirconium to avoid nitrogen porosity . Depending on the process variation and base material being welded the diameters of the electrodes used in GMAW typically range from 0 @.@ 7 to 2 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 028 – 0 @.@ 095 in ) but can be as large as 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) .

This news alerted markets to the fact that Greece 's deficit exceeded the eurozone 's maximum of 3 % outlined in the Economic and Monetary Union 's Stability and Growth Pact . Investors concerned about a possible sovereign default rapidly sold Greek bonds . Given Greece 's prior decision to embrace the euro as its currency , it no longer held monetary policy autonomy and could not intervene to depreciate a national currency to absorb the shock and boost competitiveness , as was the traditional solution to sudden capital flight . The crisis proved contagious when it spread to Portugal , Italy , and Spain ( together with Greece these are collectively referred to as the PIGS ) .

  "The conventional deployment for armies of the time was placement of infantry in the center , with the cavalry in two flanking wings . The Romans followed this convention fairly closely , but chose extra depth rather than breadth for the infantry in hopes of breaking quickly through the center of Hannibal 's line . Varro knew how the Roman infantry had managed to penetrate Hannibal 's center at Trebia , and he planned to recreate this on an even greater scale . The principes were stationed immediately behind the hastati , ready to push forward at first contact to ensure the Romans presented a unified front .

This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles ( such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse ) , but the situation at the magazine deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribune 's position on World War I , and the Tribune editors were unhappy with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine .

  "The South Downs , a range of chalk hills , surrounded the ancient fishing and farming village of Brighton ( formerly Brighthelmston ) . The downland pasture sloped down to the English Channel coast and was farmed in one of two ways : some parts were divided into strips according to a local system of \" laines \" , furlongs \" and \" paul @-@ pieces \" , and other areas were left for the grazing of sheep . The area now covered by Montpelier was an example of the latter . The five laines around Brighton were based on land with a relatively gentle slope ; when the gradient or height made the land too difficult to work , no more strips were marked out and the rest of the land was given over to grazing . A map of Brighton from the 1740s shows that a large section in the northwest of the parish — north of West Laine , west of North Laine and bisected by the road to Steyning — was marked as \" sheep down \" . It had no official name at the time , but by 1792 it had become known as Church Hill in reference to St Nicholas ' Church , the parish church of Brighton which stood on a hillock near the road .

  "American sperm whaling soon spread from the east coast of the American colonies to the Gulf Stream , the Grand Banks , West Africa ( 1763 ) , the Azores ( 1765 ) , and the South Atlantic ( 1770s ) .

In the same decade , the British began sperm whaling , employing American ships and personnel . By the following decade , the French had entered the trade , also employing American expertise . Sperm whaling increased until the mid @-@ nineteenth century . Spermaceti oil was important in public lighting ( for example , in lighthouses , where it was used in the United States until 1862 , when it was replaced by lard oil , in turn replaced by petroleum ) and for lubricating the machines ( such as those used in cotton mills ) of the Industrial Revolution . Sperm whaling declined in the second half of the nineteenth century , as petroleum came into broader use . In that sense , petroleum use may be said to have protected whale populations from even greater exploitation . Sperm whaling in the eighteenth century began with small sloops carrying only one or two whaleboats . The fleet 's scope and size increased over time , and larger ships entered the fishery . In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century sperm whaling ships sailed to the equatorial Pacific , the Indian Ocean , Japan , the coast of Arabia , Australia and New Zealand . Hunting could be dangerous to the crew , since sperm whales ( especially bulls ) will readily fight to defend themselves against attack , unlike most baleen whales .

Tantalum compounds with oxidation states as low as − 1 have been reported in 2008 . As in the cases of most other refractory metals , the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides . Tantalum carbide , TaC , like the more commonly used tungsten carbide , is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools . Tantalum ( III ) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes . Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide @-@ graphite composite material that is one of the hardest materials ever synthesized . Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum @-@ tungsten @-@ copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys . There are two tantalum aluminides , TaAl3 and Ta3Al . These are stable , refractory , and reflective , and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors .",

  "The transformation of Hungary into a Christian state was one of Stephen 's principal concerns throughout his reign . Although the Hungarians ' conversion had already begun in his father 's reign , it was only Stephen who systematically forced his subjects to give up their pagan rituals . His legislative activity was closely connected with Christianity . For example , his First Book of Laws from the first years of his reign includes several provisions prescribing the observance of feast days and the confession before death . His other laws protected property rights and the interests of widows and orphans , or regulated the status of serfs .",

  "By the beginning of 1896 , Edison had turned his attention to promoting a projector technology , the Phantoscope , developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat . The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon , who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator . With Dickson having left his employ , the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period . Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year , Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems , the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope . In 1912 , he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope , which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film — the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors . It was a commercial failure . Four years later , the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology , a short @-@ lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope .

Decades of observations by recreational and commercial fishermen suggest such spring spawning migrations are common across the Murray cod 's geographical range .

  "There is also a reference to Catraeth in the slightly later poem Moliant Cadwallon , a panegyric addressed to Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd , thought to have been composed in about 633 . Two lines in this poem are translated by Koch as \" fierce Gwallawc wrought the great and renowned mortality at Catraeth \" . He identifies Gwallawc as the \" Guallauc \" who was one of the kings who fought against Bernicia in alliance with Urien . Koch draws attention to the mention of meibion Godebawc ( the sons of Godebog ) as an enemy in stanza 15 of the Gododdin and points out that according to old Welsh genealogies Urien and other Brittonic kings were descendants of \" Coïl Hen Guotepauc \" . He considers that , in view of the references in the three poems , there is a case for identifying the attack on Catraeth recorded in Y Gododdin with the Battle of Gwen Ystrat . This would date the poem to about 570 rather than the c . 600 favoured by Williams and others . He interprets the Gododdin as having fought the Brythons of Rheged and Alt Clut over a power struggle in Elmet , with Anglian allies on both sides , Rheged being in an alliance with Deira . He points out that according to the Historia Britonnum it was Rhun , son of Urien Rheged who baptized the princess Eanflæd of Deira , her father Edwin and 12 @,@ 000 of his subjects in 626 / 7 .

Clarkson , for example , makes the point that the reference in Gweith Gwen Ystrat is to \" the men of Catraeth \" ; it does not state that the battle was fought at Catraeth , and also that according to Bede it was Paulinus , not Rhun , who baptized the Deirans .",

  "The fortifications had only relatively thin crenelated walls , which were insufficiently strong to counter artillery bombardments . They were lined with many tall towers for archers , but could not be used to mount cannon . Don Luis Bravo de Acuña , the governor of Gibraltar , produced a report for the king recommending a series of changes to the territory 's fortifications . A series of new batteries was built along the Line Wall , each named after saints , and a New Mole ( later renamed the South Mole ) was built to provide additional protection to ships in the harbour . On the north side of Gibraltar , the Muralla de San Bernando ( now the Grand Battery ) was fully adapted to mount cannon facing the isthmus with the old archery towers being pulled down and replaced by bastions . The Old Mole , stretching into the Bay of Gibraltar , provided further mountings for cannon to sweep the isthmus . A series of defensive works constructed on a glacis above the entrance to the town provided further enfilading fire . A formidable bastion was constructed to protect the south of the town ; known as the Baluarte de Nuestra Señora del Rosario ( \" Bastion of Our Lady of the Rosary \" ) , and now as the South Bastion , it enfiladed the ditch across the Gate of Africa , now the Southport Gates . However , the effectiveness of the new fortifications was undermined by the continued failure of the Spanish crown to provide enough troops to man them .",

  "Each level starts with a few large asteroids drifting in various directions on the screen . Objects wrap around screen edges – for instance , an asteroid that drifts off the top edge of the screen reappears at the bottom and continues moving in the same direction . As the player shoots asteroids , they break into smaller asteroids that move faster and are more difficult to hit . Smaller asteroids are also worth more points . Two flying saucers appear periodically on the screen ; the \" big saucer \" shoots randomly and poorly , while the \" small saucer \" fires frequently at the ship . After reaching a score of 40 @,@ 000 , only the small saucer appears . As the player 's score increases , the angle range of the shots from the small saucer diminishes until the saucer fires extremely accurately . Once the screen has been cleared of all asteroids and flying saucers , a new set of large asteroids appears , thus starting the next level .

  "Published in response to Edmund Burke 's Reflections on the Revolution in France ( 1790 ) , which was a defence of constitutional monarchy , aristocracy , and the Church of England , and an attack on Wollstonecraft 's friend , the Rev Richard Price at the Newington Green Unitarian Church , Wollstonecraft 's A Vindication of the Rights of Men ( 1790 ) attacks aristocracy and advocates republicanism . Hers was the first response in a pamphlet war that subsequently became known as the Revolution Controversy , in which Thomas Paine 's Rights of Man ( 1792 ) became the rallying cry for reformers and radicals .",
  "Accurate determinations of Avogadro 's number require the measurement of a single quantity on both the atomic and macroscopic scales using the same unit of measurement . This became possible for the first time when American physicist Robert Millikan measured the charge on an electron in 1910 . The electric charge per mole of electrons is a constant called the Faraday constant and had been known since 1834 when Michael Faraday published his works on electrolysis . By dividing the charge on a mole of electrons by the charge on a single electron the value of Avogadro 's number is obtained . Since 1910 , newer calculations have more accurately determined the values for the Faraday constant and the elementary charge . ( See below )",

  "Pickett 's division arrived at the Battle of Gettysburg on the evening of the second day , July 2 , 1863 . It was reduced to 3 brigades present , Corse 's still being detached in Virginia and Jenkins ' transferred . It had been delayed by the assignment of guarding the Confederate lines of communication through Chambersburg , Pennsylvania . After two days of heavy fighting , General Robert E. Lee 's Army of Northern Virginia , which had initially driven the Union Army of the Potomac to the high ground south of Gettysburg , had been unable to dislodge the Union soldiers from their position . Lee 's plan for July 3 called for a massive assault on the center of the Union lines on Cemetery Ridge , calculating that Meade had concentrated his forces to protect his flanks while leaving his center weak . Lee directed General Longstreet to assemble a force of three divisions for the attack — two divisions from the corps of Lieutenant General A.P. Hill , under the temporary command of J. Johnston Pettigrew and Major General Isaac R. Trimble , which had both seen action on July 1 , and Pickett 's fresh division from Longstreet 's own corps . The center was occupied by the Union II Corps , commanded by Major General Winfield S. Hancock . Longstreet was technically in command , not Pickett . Nevertheless , the attack became known as \" Pickett 's Charge \" . In addition , much of the mythology of the Charge arose from newspaper reports . As Pickett was the only major general from Virginia to participate in the charge , the Virginia newspapers both played up their native son 's role and made the assault a more \" glamorous \" event .",

Later that season against Surrey , he performed what was regarded by Wisden as one of his best bowling feats . Surrey needed 184 runs to win and seemed certain winners when they had scored 127 for two . After Emmott Robinson took a wicket , Kilner took the last five for only 15 runs in a match @-@ winning performance .

  "Suharto unexpectedly resigned on 21 May 1998 , one week after he returned from a Group of 15 meeting in Cairo , which took place during the riots . The reform government formed by his successor Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie began a campaign to rebuild the confidence of Chinese Indonesians who had fled the country , particularly businessmen . Along with one of his envoys James Riady , son of financial magnate Mochtar Riady , Habibie appealed to Chinese Indonesians seeking refuge throughout East Asia , Australia , and North America to return and promised security from various government ministries as well as other political figures , such as Abdurrahman Wahid and Amien Rais . Despite Habibie 's efforts he was met with skepticism because of remarks he made , as Vice President and as President , which suggested that the message was insincere . One special envoy described Chinese Indonesians as the key to restoring \" badly needed \" capital and economic activity , prioritizing businessmen as the target of their pleas . Others , including economist Kwik Kian Gie , saw the government 's efforts as perpetuating the myth of Chinese economic domination rather than affirming the ethnic Chinese identity .",

  "One of the last tropical cyclones of the season formed on October 15 just northeast of the Bahamas . Although listed as a tropical storm , it would have likely been classified as a subtropical cyclone beginning in the 1970s , but was unable to be classified as such given the lack of satellite imagery to prove its status . Given the name \" Jig \" , it moved northeastward , quickly attaining hurricane status with winds of 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) , which it maintained for a full day . On October 16 , Jig began a slow weakening trend , weakening below hurricane force and turning sharply northeastward . During this time , the storm made its closest approach to the southeastern United States while passing well southeast of Cape Hatteras . While offshore , the storm increased surf along the North Carolina and Virginia coastlines , prompting storm warnings . Early October 18 , Jig became extratropical with winds of 70 mph ( 113 km / h ) and began a counterclockwise loop over the western Atlantic .

  "Research into meiosis has been considerably simplified since every germ cell nucleus is at the same given position as it moves down the gonad , so is at the same stage in meiosis . In an early phase of meiosis , the oocytes become extremely resistant to radiation and this resistance depends on expression of genes rad51 and atm that have key roles in recombinational repair . Gene mre @-@ 11 also plays a crucial role in recombinational repair of DNA damage during meiosis . A study of the frequency of outcrossing in natural populations showed that selfing is the predominant mode of reproduction in C. elegans , but that infrequent outcrossing events occur at a rate around 1 % . Meioses that result in selfing are unlikely to contribute significantly to beneficial genetic variability , but these meioses may provide the adaptive benefit of recombinational repair of DNA damages that arise , especially under stressful conditions .",

In September 2011 , Drogba joined the Truth , Reconciliation and Dialogue Commission as a representative to help return peace to his home nation . His involvement in the peace process led to Drogba being named as one of the world 's 100 most influential people by Time magazine for 2010 . Drogba 's charity work continued when , in late 2009 , he announced he would be donating the £ 3 million signing on fee for his endorsement of Pepsi for the construction of a hospital in his hometown of Abidjan . This work was done through Drogba 's recently created \" Didier Drogba Foundation \" and Chelsea announced they too would donate the fee for the deal toward the Foundation 's project . Drogba decided on building the hospital after a recent trip to the Ivorian capital 's other hospitals , saying \" ... I decided the Foundation 's first project should be to build and fund a hospital giving people basic healthcare and a chance just to stay alive . \"",

  "Another common situation in the interplay between the two boards is a player not moving , also called sitting or stalling . This can happen in anticipation of a certain piece or at the request of the partner . Suppose a player is under heavy attack , and an additional pawn would mate him . When the partner cannot prevent giving up a pawn on the next move , sitting is the only strategy . It would of course be perfectly logical for the attacker to sit as well , waiting for a pawn to come . The situation where diagonal opponents sit at the same time is known as a \" sitzkrieg \" ( literally \" sitting war \" in German , and a pun on \" blitzkrieg \" ) . The difference in time between the diagonal opponents will eventually force one party to move .

Green spells often focus on growth , such as regaining life points , amassing large quantities of green mana , and getting land cards faster , thus allowing the player more resources and the capacity to get strong creatures on the battlefield faster . Green 's weakness is an inability to defend against indirect attacks . It has few cards that allow it to counterattack against the hand , library , or graveyard ; Green also has few defenses against creatures that bypass its own powerful creatures when attacking .",

  "Additional evidence of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede . The detection of ozone ( O3 ) bands was announced in 1996 . In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer ( or diatomic ) absorption features of molecular oxygen . Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase . The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped in ice . The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude , rather than on surface albedo — they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede , whereas O3 shows an opposite trend .

  "Whether one of the three texts was the standard version , from which the other two were originally translated , is a question that has remained controversial . Letronne attempted to show in 1841 that the Greek version was the original , produced by the Egyptian government under its Ptolemaic dynasty .

Philippe Derchain and Heinz Josef Thissen have argued that all three versions were composed simultaneously , while Stephen Quirke sees in the decree \" an intricate coalescence of three vital textual traditions \" . Richard Parkinson points out that the hieroglyphic version strays from archaic formalism and occasionally lapses into language closer to that of the demotic register that the priests more commonly used in everyday life . The fact that the three versions cannot be matched word for word helps to explain why its decipherment has been more difficult than originally expected , especially for those original scholars who were expecting an exact bilingual key to Egyptian hieroglyphs .",

Quarrels with Tsar Alexander , particularly over the fate of France intensified in January , prompting Alexander to storm out . He therefore missed the arrival of Castlereagh in mid @-@ January . Metternich and Castlereagh formed a good working relationship and then met with Alexander at Langres . The Tsar remained unaccommodating however , demanding a push into the centre of France ; fortunately , he was too preoccupied to object to Metternich 's other ideas , like a final peace conference in Vienna . Metternich did not attend talks with the French at Chatillon , as he wanted to stay with Alexander . The talks stalled , and , after a brief advance , Coalition forces had to retreat after the Montmirail and Montereau . This relieved Metternich 's fears that an overconfident Alexander might act unilaterally .",

  "Core Design , a subsidiary of Eidos , created Lara Croft as the lead protagonist of its video game Tomb Raider , which began development in 1993 . Lead graphic artist Toby Gard went through about five designs before arriving at the character 's final appearance . He initially envisioned a male lead character with a whip and a hat . Core Design co @-@ founder Jeremy Smith characterized the design as derivative of Indiana Jones , and asked for more originality . Gard decided that a female character would work better from a design standpoint . He also expressed a desire to counter stereotypical female characters , which he has characterized as \" bimbos \" or \" dominatrix \" types . Smith was sceptical of a female lead at first because few contemporary games featured them . He came to regard a female lead as a great hook and put faith in Gard 's idea . Inspired by pop artist Neneh Cherry and comic book character Tank Girl , Gard experimented with different designs , including a muscular woman and a Nazi @-@ like militant . He settled on a tough South American woman with a braid named Laura Cruz . Eidos management preferred a more \" UK friendly \" name , and selected Lara Croft from similar @-@ sounding British names found in an English telephone directory . Along with the name change , the character 's backstory was altered to incorporate a British origin .",

  "Kowalski feels the isolation of the precogs ensures that they see their visions merely as facts , and removes them from having to justify them . The precogs ' ignorance of the results of their visions prevents them from knowing the effectiveness of the program . He feels the PreCrime officers are thus more qualified to evaluate their efficacy \" than the precogs themselves . \" In the December 2003 edition of the academic journal Film Criticism , scholar Mark Garrett Cooper moved past that point by asserting that not only have the precogs \" yet to fully understand \" their visions , but that the process by which the images are interpreted makes it so that no one individual could understand them without the use of the apparatus . The machinery is so effective and precise according to Cooper however , that the \" omnipresent system effectively makes capture more certain than the crime . \" When the system targets Cruise , instead of fleeing , he remains in the vicinity in the belief that the system will , in its inexorable logic , correct itself .

  "A series of minor actions followed as the Australians continued their advance up the Milford Highway . After a month of fighting , the island was largely secured and following the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in early August 1945 , the Japanese sued for peace and hostilities came to an end .

  "After the Chancery Regulation Act 1862 had gone some way toward procedural reform , in February 1867 , Roundell Palmer again brought the problem of having two separate court systems to Parliament 's attention , and in March 1870 Lord Hatherley introduced a bill to create a single , unified High Court of Justice . The bill was a weak one , not containing any provision addressing which court would deal with the common law and which with equity , and was also silent on the structure of the court , as Hatherley believed the difference between the common law and equity was one of procedure , not substance . As a result , the bill was heavily opposed from two sides : those who opposed fusion , and those who supported fusion but felt the provisions were too weak and vague to be of any use . As a result , the bill was eventually withdrawn .",

Four ships were sent back to France in 1797 and 1798 as Île de France could no longer supply repairs , manpower or provisions in support of Sercey . This dispersal of the squadron was encouraged by the Colonial Assembly of Île de France and Governor Malartic neither of whom were well @-@ disposed to the Directory then ruling France . With his remaining crews becoming rebellious , Sercey sent Forte and Prudente on a commerce raiding operation during the autumn of 1798 , during which they achieved some success in the Bay of Bengal . By the time this force returned to Île de France Sercey had sailed to Batavia , leaving instructions for Forte and Prudente to follow him . Malartic countermanded this order , seizing Prudente and selling the frigate to a privateer concern and ordering Forte to operate independently in the Bay of Bengal in the autumn of 1798 . Sercey was furious , but could do nothing to alter Malartic 's arrangements .",

  "Hoping to extend the Continental System meant to choke off British goods from the European mainland , Napoleon invaded Iberia and declared his brother Joseph the King of Spain in 1808 . The Spanish and the Portuguese revolted with British support . The Peninsular War lasted six years , featured brutal guerrilla warfare , and culminated in victory by the allied powers of Portugal , Spain , and Britain . The Continental System caused recurring diplomatic conflicts between France and its allies , especially Russia . Unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade , the Russians violated the Continental System and enticed Napoleon into war . The French launched an invasion of Russia in the summer of 1812 . The resulting campaign witnessed the catastrophic collapse of the Grand Army , the widespread destruction of Russian lands and cities , and inspired a renewed push against Napoleon by his enemies . In 1813 , Prussia and Austria joined Russian forces in a Sixth Coalition against France . A chaotic military campaign culminated in a large Allied army defeating Napoleon at the Battle of Leipzig in October 1813 .

The British later exiled him to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic , where he spent the remainder of his years .

  "Andrew II was strongly influenced by his wife , Gertrude of Merania . She openly expressed her preference for her German compatriots , which caused her assassination by a group of local lords in 1213 . A new uprising broke out while the king was in the Holy Land on his crusade in 1217 and 1218 . Finally , a movement of the royal servants , who were actually free landholders directly subordinated to the sovereign , obliged Andrew II to issue his Golden Bull in 1222 . It summarized the royal servants ' liberties , including their tax exemption . Its last provision authorized the secular and spiritual lords to \" resist and speak against \" the sovereign \" without the charge of high treason \" . The Golden Bull also prohibited the employment of Muslims and Jews in royal administration . This ban was confirmed when Andrew II , urged by the prelates , issued the Golden Bull 's new variant in 1231 , which authorized the archbishop of Esztergom to excommunicate him in case of his departure from its provisions . For non @-@ Christians who continued to be employed in the royal household , Archbishop Robert of Esztergom placed the kingdom under interdict in 1232 . Andrew II was forced to take an oath , which included his promise to respect the privileged position of clergymen and to dismiss all his Jewish and Muslim officials . A growing intolerance against non @-@ Catholics is also demonstrated by the transfer of the Orthodox monastery of Visegrád to the Benedictines in 1221 .",

  "Cnidaria have no brains or even central nervous systems . Instead they have decentralized nerve nets consisting of sensory neurons that generate signals in response to various types of stimulus , such as odors , motor neurons that tell muscles to contract , and \" cobwebs \" of intermediate neurons to connect them . As well as forming the \" signal cables \" , intermediate neurons also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers . The cilia of the cnidocytes detect physical contact . Nerves inform cnidocytes when odors from prey or attackers are detected and when neighbouring cnidocytes fire . Most of the communications between nerve cells are via chemical synapses , small gaps across which chemicals flow . As this process is too slow to ensure that the muscles round the rim of a medusa 's bell contract simultaneously in swimming the neurons which control this communicate by much faster electrical signals across gap junctions .",

Johnson found Greeneville boring , and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son Robert in 1869 . Seeking vindication for himself , and revenge against his political enemies , he launched a Senate bid soon after returning home . Tennessee had gone Republican , but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the Ku Klux Klan kept down the African @-@ American vote , leading to a Democratic victory in the legislative elections in August 1869 . Johnson was seen as a likely victor in the Senate election , although hated by Radical Republicans , and also by some Democrats because of his wartime activities . Although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature 's balloting , the Republicans eventually elected Henry Cooper over Johnson , 54 – 51 . In 1872 , there was a special election for an at @-@ large congressional seat for Tennessee ; Johnson initially sought the Democratic nomination , but when he saw that it would go to former Confederate general Benjamin F. Cheatham , decided to run as an independent . The former president was defeated , finishing third , but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favor of an old Johnson Unionist ally , Horace Maynard .",

  "By 1573 , Château Gaillard was uninhabited and in a ruinous state , but it was still believed that the castle posed a threat to the local population if it was repaired . Therefore , at the request of the French States @-@ General , King Henry IV ordered the demolition of Château Gaillard in 1599 . Some of the building material was reused by Capuchin monks who were granted permission to use the stone for maintaining their monasteries . In 1611 , the demolition of Château Gaillard came to an end . The site was left as a ruin , and in 1862 was classified as a monument historique . In 1962 , a conference on the contributions of the Normans to medieval military architecture was held at Les Andelys . Allen Brown attended the conference and remarked that the castle was \" in satisfying receipt of skilful care and attention \" . The journal Château Gaillard : Études de Castellogie Médiévale , which was published as a result of the conference , has since run to 23 volumes , based on international conferences on the subject of castles . In the 1990s , archaeological excavations were carried out at Château Gaillard . The excavations investigated the north of the fortress , searching for an entrance postulated by architect Eugène Viollet @-@ le @-@ Duc , but no such entrance was found . However , the excavation did reveal was that there was an addition to the north of the castle to enable the use of guns . Typologically , the structure has been dated to the 16th century . The conclusion of the excavations was that the site had \" enormous archaeological potential \" , but that there were still unanswered questions about the castle . After Philip II took Chateau Gaillard , he repaired the collapsed tower of the outer bailey that had been used to gain access to the castle . The archaeological investigation examined the tower generally thought to be the one collapsed by Philip , and although it did not recover any dating evidence , the consensus is that he completely rebuilt the tower . In conjunction with the archaeological work , efforts were made to preserve the remaining structures . Today , Château Gaillard 's inner bailey is open to the public from March to November , while the outer baileys are open all year round .",
