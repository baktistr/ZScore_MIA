  "It was not until fifteen years later , when yet another committee — the Coastal Fortification Committee of 1839 ( 1839 års kustbefästningskommitté ) — studied the defence of Norrland , that the Swedish Armed Forces started to focus a bit more on the northern provinces . This study however mainly presented plans for middle Norrland , and the provinces of Medelpad , Ångermanland and Jämtland . Those provinces had a more significant role as it was there that the main roads of Sweden started to intersect with the road network of Norway , which at the time was allied with Sweden . The road network north of this area consisted of the large coastal road — the only major north – south road — from Haparanda and all the way through Norrland down to Gävle . All the other major roads exclusively ran southeast – northwest — following the run of the large rivers — before ending in wilderness and thus did not provide any route further west into Norway and on to the Atlantic coast . The plans to strengthen Norrland by building a central fortress either on Frösön outside Östersund , or closer to the coast at Borgsjö outside Ånge , once again fell flat due to lack of money and lower priority compared to fortifications in southern Sweden .",

  "Like all other lemurs , the silky sifaka is a seasonal breeder , and it is thought that it mates only one day a year during the start of the rainy season sometime in December or January . Infants are born six months later in June or July . Females typically give birth to a single infant once every two years , although births in consecutive years have been observed . Infants initially cling to the fur of their mother 's chest for nearly four weeks and then switch to riding on her back . As with other eastern rainforest sifakas , the infants of this species develop rapidly . This may be due to assistance in the care of infants by all group members ( known as alloparental care ) — a trait typical among all sifakas . Non @-@ maternal care usually takes the form of allogrooming , but also playing , occasional carrying , and in rare cases , nursing . The dispersal of offspring is thought to be similar to that of other eastern rainforest sifakas , with both males and females transferring out of the group at sexual maturity . However , dispersal has only been observed once with a young adult male , who left its natal group and proceeded to oust an older male from a group in which he had been a member for seven years . Female dispersal and group transfer has not yet been observed .",

  "After the foundation and success of the American School for the Deaf , many other institutions for the deaf were founded throughout the country . Since schools , particularly in the South , were segregated , many Southern states created separate schools or departments for the Black deaf . The first school established for the Black deaf below the Mason – Dixon line opened in the District of Columbia in 1857 and remained segregated until 1958 . The last Southern state to create an institution for the Black deaf was Louisiana in 1938 . Black Deaf children thus became a language community isolated from the White Deaf with different means of language socialization , allowing for different dialects to develop . Because the education of White children was privileged over that of Black children , Oralism — the prominent pedagogical method of the time — was not as strictly applied to the Black deaf students . Oralist methods often forbade the use of sign language , so Black deaf students had more opportunities to use ASL than their White peers . Despite the decision in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 which declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional , integration was slow to come , and schools for the deaf were no exception : the last desegregated in 1978 , 24 years after the decision .",
  "The agricultural crisis at the turn of the 20th century caused many aristocratic families to sell their paintings , but the British national collections were priced out of the market by American plutocrats .

  "Shortly before dawn on 10 April , the five destroyers of the British 2nd Destroyer Flotilla surprised the German ships in Narvik harbor . They torpedoed two destroyers and badly damaged the other three while suffering only minor damage themselves . As they were beginning to withdraw they encountered the three destroyers of the German 4th Flotilla which had been alerted when the British began their attack . The Germans opened fire first , but the gunnery for both sides was not effective due to the mist and the smoke screen laid by the British as they retreated down the Ofotfjord . The German ships had to turn away to avoid a salvo of three torpedoes fired by one of the destroyers in Narvik . Giese and Koellner were very low on fuel and all three were running low on ammunition , so Commander Bey decided not to continue the pursuit of the British ships since they were being engaged by the last two destroyers of Group 1 .",

It was not considered a good game , with the home side 's 11 – 6 victory coming through stronger defence . The fast pace of the Queensland backs almost resulted in a try early in the first half but the ball was knocked on over the line after the defenders were beaten .

Repeated attacks from Queensland failed to provide points and NSW scored another try for an 8 – 0 lead at the end of the first half . A further try came for NSW from \" some sparkling work \" , and Queensland gained two penalty goals , being prevented from scoring any tries by the defensive work of Verge , J.

A scrum ensued and Queensland won the ball and kicked it away . Verge caught the ball running at full pace and went for the corner , but was pushed off the field just before he could score . Verge 's good game at fullback earned him selection for the return match on 15 June .",

Polar bears can breed with brown bears to produce fertile grizzly – polar bear hybrids , rather than indicating that they have only recently diverged , the new evidence suggests more frequent mating has continued over a longer period of time , and thus the two bears remain genetically similar . However , because neither species can survive long in the other 's ecological niche , and because they have different morphology , metabolism , social and feeding behaviours , and other phenotypic characteristics , the two bears are generally classified as separate species .",

  "When taxes once payable to Rome were transferred to the Crown , Cromwell saw the need to assess the taxable value of the Church 's extensive holdings as they stood in 1535 . The result was an extensive compendium , the Valor Ecclesiasticus . In September of the same year , Cromwell commissioned a more general visitation of religious institutions , to be undertaken by four appointee visitors . The visitation focussed almost exclusively on the country 's religious houses , with largely negative conclusions . In addition to reporting back to Cromwell , the visitors made the lives of the monks more difficult by enforcing strict behavioural standards . The result was to encourage self @-@ dissolution . In any case , the evidence gathered by Cromwell led swiftly to the beginning of the state @-@ enforced dissolution of the monasteries with all religious houses worth less than £ 200 vested by statute in the crown in January 1536 . After a short pause , surviving religious houses were transferred one by one to the Crown and onto new owners , and the dissolution confirmed by a further statute in 1539 . By January 1540 no such houses remained : some 800 had been dissolved . The process had been efficient , with minimal resistance , and brought the crown some £ 90 @,@ 000 a year . The extent to which the dissolution of all houses was planned from the start is debated by historians ; there is some evidence that major houses were originally intended only to be reformed . Cromwell 's actions transferred a fifth of England 's landed wealth to new hands . The programme was designed primarily to create a landed gentry beholden to the crown , which would use the lands much more efficiently . Although little opposition to the supremacy could be found in England 's religious houses , they had links to the international church and were an obstacle to further religious reform .",

On December 10 , 1953 , before leaving for Guatemala , Guevara sent an update to his Aunt Beatriz from San José , Costa Rica . In the letter Guevara speaks of traversing through the dominion of the United Fruit Company ; a journey which convinced him that Company 's capitalist system was a terrible one . This affirmed indignation carried the more aggressive tone he adopted in order to frighten his more Conservative relatives , and ends with Guevara swearing on an image of the then recently deceased Joseph Stalin , not to rest until these \" octopuses have been vanquished \" . Later that month , Guevara arrived in Guatemala where President Jacobo Árbenz Guzmán headed a democratically elected government that , through land reform and other initiatives , was attempting to end the latifundia system . To accomplish this , President Árbenz had enacted a major land reform program , where all uncultivated portions of large land holdings were to be expropriated and redistributed to landless peasants . The biggest land owner , and one most affected by the reforms , was the United Fruit Company , from which the Árbenz government had already taken more than 225 @,@ 000 acres ( 91 @,@ 000 ha ) of uncultivated land .

  "A posthumous retrial opened after the war ended . Pope Callixtus III authorized this proceeding , also known as the \" nullification trial \" , at the request of Inquisitor @-@ General Jean Bréhal and Joan 's mother Isabelle Romée . The purpose of the trial was to investigate whether the trial of condemnation and its verdict had been handled justly and according to canon law . Investigations started with an inquest by Guillaume Bouillé , a theologian and former rector of the University of Paris ( Sorbonne ) . Bréhal conducted an investigation in 1452 . A formal appeal followed in November 1455 . The appellate process involved clergy from throughout Europe and observed standard court procedure . A panel of theologians analyzed testimony from 115 witnesses . Bréhal drew up his final summary in June 1456 , which describes Joan as a martyr and implicated the late Pierre Cauchon with heresy for having convicted an innocent woman in pursuit of a secular vendetta . The technical reason for her execution had been a Biblical clothing law . The nullification trial reversed the conviction in part because the condemnation proceeding had failed to consider the doctrinal exceptions to that stricture .

In the Dinosaur Park Formation , over fifty articulated specimens have been found , coming from many different genera . Among them , juveniles are hard to identify at the species level . Earlier , four genera and thirteen species were recognized from the formation 's area , when paleontologists used differences in size and crest shape to differentiate taxa .

Life in earlier keeps had been focused around a single great hall , with privacy for the owner 's family provided by using an upper floor for their own living accommodation . By the 14th century nobles were travelling less , bringing much larger households with them when they did travel and entertaining visitors with equally large retinues . Castles such as Goodrich were redesigned in the 1320s to provide greater residential privacy and comfort for the ruling family , while retaining strong defensive features and a capacity to hold over 130 residents at the castle . The design influenced subsequent conversions at Berkeley and by the time that Bolton Castle was being built , in the 1380s , it was designed to hold up to eight different noble households , each with their own facilities . Royal castles such as Beaumaris , although designed with defence in mind , were designed to hold up to eleven different households at any one time .",

  "There are a couple of noted Cabernet Sauvignon flavors that are intimately tied to viticultural and climate influences . The most widely recognized is the herbaceous or green bell pepper flavor caused by pyrazines , which are more prevalent in underripened grapes . Pyrazine compounds are present in all Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and are gradually destroyed by sunlight as the grape continues to ripen . To the human palate this compound is detectable in wines with pyrazine levels as low as 2 nanograms ( ng ) per liter . At the time of veraison , when the grapes first start to fully ripen , there is the equivalent pyrazine level of 30 ng / l . In cooler climates , it is difficult to get Cabernet Sauvignon grapes to ripen fully to the point where pyrazine is not detected . The green bell pepper flavor is not considered a wine fault but it may not be desirable to all consumers ' tastes . The California wine region of Monterey was noted in the late 20th century for its very vegetal Cabernet Sauvignon with pronounced green pepper flavor , earning the nickname of \" Monterey veggies \" . In addition to its cool climate , Monterey is also prone to being very windy , which can have the effect of shutting down the grape vines and further inhibiting ripeness .",

  "In 1948 Britain 's railways , and hence the canal , were nationalised , and became the responsibility of the British Transport Commission . In 1963 control of the canal passed to British Waterways . Under the terms of the Transport Act 1968 , all waterways within the jurisdiction of British Waterways were classified as commercial , cruising or remainder waterways . Remainder waterways were those that were deemed to have no economic future , and maintenance would only be carried out where failure to do so would create health or safety issues .

  "The deep model easily explains the strong prograde jet observed at the equator of Jupiter ; the jets it produces are stable and do not obey the 2D stability criterion . However it has major difficulties ; it produces a very small number of broad jets , and realistic simulations of 3D flows are not possible as of 2008 , meaning that the simplified models used to justify deep circulation may fail to catch important aspects of the fluid dynamics within Jupiter . One model published in 2004 successfully reproduced the Jovian band @-@ jet structure . It assumed that the molecular hydrogen mantle is thinner than in all other models ; occupying only the outer 10 % of Jupiter 's radius . In standard models of the Jovian interior , the mantle comprises the outer 20 – 30 % . The driving of deep circulation is another problem . The deep flows can be caused both by shallow forces ( moist convection , for instance ) or by deep planet @-@ wide convection that transports heat out of the Jovian interior . Which of these mechanisms is more important is not clear yet .",
  "From this period onwards Verdi also develops his instinct for \" tinta \" ( literally ' colour ' ) , a term which he used for characterising elements of an individual opera score – Parker gives as an example \" the rising 6th that begins so many lyric pieces in Ernani \" . Macbeth , even in its original 1847 version , shows many original touches ; characterization by key ( the Macbeths themselves generally singing in sharp keys , the witches in flat keys ) , a preponderance of minor key music , and highly original orchestration . In the ' dagger scene ' and the duet following the murder of Duncan , the forms transcend the ' Code Rossini ' and propel the drama in a compelling fashion . Verdi was to comment in 1868 that Rossini and his followers missed \" the golden thread that binds all the parts together and , rather than a set of numbers without coherence , makes an opera . \" Tinta was for Verdi this \" golden thread \" , an essential unifying factor in his works .",

  "Precipitation is highly seasonal and mostly concentrated in the summer months . It is distributed irregularly owing to the country 's topography although it generally decreases from east to west . As moist air reaches the eastern slopes of the mountains , it rises and cools adiabatically , leading to the formation of clouds that generate copious amounts of rain . The eastern slopes of the mountains receive between 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 mm ( 39 to 59 in ) of precipitation a year although some places receive up to 2 @,@ 500 mm ( 98 in ) of precipitation annually owing to orographic precipitation . In the south , the orographic effect is enhanced by advancing cold fronts from the south , resulting in increased precipitation . The high rainfall on these first slopes creates the thick Yungas jungle that extends in a narrow strip along these ranges . During fall , the jungles are covered by fog and complete cloud cover . Beyond the first slopes of the Andes into the valleys , the air descends , warming adiabatically , and becoming drier than on the eastern slopes . The north – south orientation of the mountains , which increase in altitude to the west , and a discontinuous topography , creates valleys with regions of relatively high orographic precipitation in the west and drier regions in east .",

  "The stories in Scientific Detective Monthly were almost always detective stories , but they were only occasionally science fiction , as in many cases the science appearing in the stories already had practical applications . In the first issue , for example , \" The Mystery of the Bulawayo Diamond \" , by Arthur B. Reeve , mentions unusual science , but the mystery is solved by use of a bolometer to detect a blush on the face of a black girl . The murderer in \" The Campus Murder Mystery \" , by Ralph W. Wilkins , freezes the body to conceal the manner of death ; a chemical catalyst and electrical measurements of palm sweat provide the scientific elements in two other stories in the same issue . The only genuine science fiction story in the first issue is \" The Perfect Counterfeit \" by Captain S.P. Meek , in which a matter duplicator has been used to counterfeit paper money . Van Dine 's Philo Vance novel , The Bishop Murder Case , began serialization in the first issue , which probably assisted sales , since the hardcover edition of the novel , which had appeared only a few months previously , had sold well . It was not science fiction , however , and throughout the magazine 's run , only one or two stories per issue include elements that would qualify them as science fiction . Mike Ashley , a historian of the field , suggests that Gernsback was more interested in stories about the science of detection than in imaginary science : most of Scientific Detective Monthly 's contents were gadget stories , of a kind which Gernsback had been publishing in his other magazines for some time . The cover for the first issue , by Jno Ruger , showed a detective using an electronic device to measure the reactions of a suspect .",

  "This \" indiscreet bishop ... friar \" was , of course , Clement . Alexander died from ill @-@ health on this expedition , with Clement by his side at his deathbed . Alexander 's last act was to make a grant to the bishopric of Argyll . Despite the king 's death , the expedition was a success for Clement . There was a new Bishop of Argyll by 27 September 1250 ; in the longer term , the see continued to be ruled by bishops with no long vacancies until the Reformation . Moreover , by 1255 Eóghan had given his full allegiance to the Scottish crown , albeit because of lack of favour given to him by the King of Norway . Clement 's close association with the late King Alexander II and his reputation as a successful bishop made him a key political figure during the minority of Alexander III . Clement was on the Council of Guardians , the small group of nobles and clerics who were to \" govern \" Scotland until the end of Alexander III 's boyhood . The governing Council broke down around two rival factions , one centred on Walter Comyn and the other around Alan Durward . There is little evidence about Clement 's activities in regard to the Council , but he was associated with the Comyn faction , who enjoyed the ascendency after Walter gained control of government in 1251 . In 1255 , the Durwards staged a coup at Roxburgh and ousted the \" Comyn faction \" from effective power .

  "Hours after attaining its peak intensity , Fred began to weaken as clouds began to fill the eye . By this time , the hurricane was beginning to turn toward the northwest as a subtropical ridge to the north weakened . Continued weakening took place as dry air started to erode convection along the southern edge of the system and the eye was no longer present on satellite imagery and wind shear also increased . Convection gradually became elongated in response to the shear and outflow was mostly restricted to the northeast region of the hurricane . By September 10 , the mid @-@ level circulation center was displaced from the low @-@ level circulation center . On September 11 , the convective pattern of Fred had no organized shape to it and the NHC downgraded the hurricane to a tropical storm .

  "Siward was , at some stage , married to Ælfflæd , daughter of Ealdred II of Bamburgh , and granddaughter of Uhtred the Bold . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle asserts that , in 1041 Eadulf , Earl of Bamburgh , was \" betrayed \" by King Harthacnut . The \" betrayal \" seems to have been carried out by Siward ; since when the Libellus de Exordio and other sources write about the same event , they say that Siward attacked and killed Eadulf . It was thus that Siward became earl of all Northumbria , perhaps the first person to do so since Uhtred the Bold . It is possible that Siward used Ælfflæd 's lineage to claim the earldom of Bamburgh for himself , although it is unclear whether the marriage took place before or after Siward killed Eadulf . Kapelle has pointed out that no ruler of Bamburgh after Uhtred is attested at the English royal court , which he argued \" must mean they were in revolt \" against the monarchy , and that Siward 's attack may therefore have been encouraged by a monarch wishing to crush a rebellious or disloyal vassal . Siward however probably had his own interests too . Killing Eadulf eliminated his main rival in the north , and the marriage associated him with the family of Uhtred the Bold , and with Uhtred 's surviving son Gospatric .",

  "In the Civil War , the islanders supported the Union despite being located in a seceded state , and the war touched Chincoteague only lightly .

Vettel went on to win the race — becoming the fourth winner in as many races — after spending much of the race defending against Kimi Räikkönen . Having started eleventh , Räikkönen used an extra set of soft tyres to move up through the field . His team @-@ mate , Romain Grosjean , finished third . Grosjean had initially shown the pace to challenge Vettel 's lead , but unlike Räikkönen , he did not have an extra set of fresh tyres , and lost touch with the reigning World Champion after the first set of stops . Lewis Hamilton finished eighth , once again hampered by slow pit stops . He was later involved in an altercation with Nico Rosberg that saw Rosberg referred to the stewards for forcing Hamilton beyond the boundary of the circuit while defending his position , but he escaped without penalty . Hamilton went on to finish eighth , while team @-@ mate Jenson Button was forced to retire two laps from the end of the race after reporting an unusual vibration from the differential . Daniel Ricciardo was involved in early contact that saw the Australian driver slide down the order from sixth at the start to fifteenth by the end of the race , having spent most of the Grand Prix caught behind Vitaly Petrov . Vettel 's win gave him a four @-@ point lead in the championship over Hamilton , while Mark Webber 's fourth consecutive fourth place secured third overall . Red Bull Racing took the lead from McLaren in the World Constructors ' Championship , while Lotus 's double podium moved them into third overall .",
  "Like many of Keats 's odes , \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" discusses art and art 's audience . He relied on depictions of natural music in earlier poems , and works such as \" Ode to a Nightingale \" appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual . Keats reverses this when describing an urn within \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" to focus on representational art . He previously used the image of an urn in \" Ode on Indolence \" , depicting one with three figures representing Love , Ambition and Poesy . Of these three , Love and Poesy are integrated into \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" with an emphasis on how the urn , as a human artistic construct , is capable of relating to the idea of \" Truth \" . The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities : an attempt at courtship , the making of music , and a religious rite . The figures are supposed to be beautiful , and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic . Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator , the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images . The narrator interacts with the urn in a manner similar to how a critic would respond to the poem , which creates ambiguity in the poem 's final lines : \" ' Beauty is truth , truth beauty , ' – that is all / Ye know on earth , and all ye need to know . \" The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words , to whom they are speaking , and what is meant by the words , which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator .",

  "In December 1911 , the French Navy 's Technical Committee issued a report that examined the design of the Bretagne class that had been ordered for 1912 . They concluded that the amidships gun turret was an unsatisfactory choice , based on previous experiences with blast damage on battleships from the 1880s . This position influenced the construction of the next class of dreadnought battleships , for which design work began shortly thereafter . The French Navy 's design staff submitted the first draft of the new dreadnought design in February 1912 . The size of French shipyard facilities significantly impacted the design . Length was limited to 172 meters ( 564 ft ) , breadth to 27 @.@ 8 m ( 91 ft 2 in ) , and draft to approximately 8 @.@ 8 m ( 29 ft ) . These dimensions limited the ship to a displacement of around 25 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 25 @,@ 000 long tons ) and a speed of 20 to 21 knots ( 37 to 39 km / h ; 23 to 24 mph ) , depending on the armament arrangement .

  "Under the governance of the jurists Gregorius , Aurelius Arcadius Charisius , and Hermogenianus , the imperial government began issuing official books of precedent , collecting and listing all the rescripts that had been issued from the reign of Hadrian ( r . 117 – 38 ) to the reign of Diocletian .

Gregorius and Hermogenianus ' codices lack the rigid structuring of later codes , and were not published in the name of the emperor , but in the names of their compilers .

Wooden sculpting work was assigned to Antonio Corradini , as was testified by the phrase \" Antonii Coradini sculptoris Inventum \" ( \" invention of the sculptor Antonio Corradini \" ) inscribed near the bow palmette . He was an established sculptor , having already worked on commissions in Austria , Bohemia and Saxony . The gilding , in pure gold leaf , was handled by one Zuanne D 'Adamo . Some of the 1606 ship 's ornaments and sculptures , including the sculpture of Mars and the two lions of St. Mark , were salvaged and reused . The vessel was 35 m ( 115 ft ) long and more than 8 metres ( 26 ft ) high . A two @-@ deck floating palace , its main salon was covered in red velvet , had 48 windows set in a huge , elaborately carved baldacchino or canopy , and had a seating capacity of 90 . The doge 's throne was in the stern , and the prow bore the traditional figurehead representing Justice with sword and scales . The barge was propelled by 168 oarsmen rowing in teams of four on its 42 oars each 11 metres ( 36 ft ) in length ; another 40 sailors were required to man it . Only the most handsome and sturdy youths of the Arsenale were selected for the ship 's crew . The new bucentaur made its début on Ascension Day 1729 in the reign of Doge Alvise III Sebastiano Mocenigo . The event was officially recorded , and the splendour of the vessel praised with sonnets and publications such as that by Antonio Maria Lucchini entitled La Nuova regia su l 'acque nel Bucintoro nuovamente eretto all 'annua solenne funzione del giorno dell 'Ascensione di Nostro Signore ( The New Palace upon the Waters of the Newly Built Bucentaur at the Annual Solemn Function of the Day of the Ascension of Our Lord , 1751 ) .",
  "On July 11 , 1916 , the state of New York let a contract for improving a series of roadways linking Groom Corners to Waite Corners by way of Rexford Flats ( now Rexford ) . Approximately half of the project was complete by 1920 , while the remainder was completed by 1926 . In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , the portion of the Groom Corners – Waite Corners highway from Rexford to Waite Corners became part of the new NY 146 . The remainder of the highway from Rexford to Groom Corners was designated as NY 146B , a spur route of NY 146 , c . 1932 . NY 146B remained unchanged until c . 1965 , when the designation was removed from the highway . The former routing of NY 146B is now part of CR 91 , which continues eastward on Grooms Road to meet US 9 in the town of Halfmoon . Additionally , the Riverview Road portion of old NY 146B is now part of the Mohawk Towpath Scenic Byway , a National Scenic Byway .",

They populated mainly fertile soils of southern highlands and river valleys further north , all the way to the Baltic Sea . They lived alongside the more numerous native people who were still pursuing the Mesolithic lifestyle , but during the Linear Pottery culture times there wasn 't much interaction , as the two groups inhabited different environments . Their villages consisted of several , but sometimes up to a dozen or so rectangular communal long @-@ houses , some over 30 meters long , supported by wooden posts , the oldest of which come from the Lower Silesia region . One such location from about 5000 BCE was also unearthed at Olszanica , which is now at the west end of Kraków just within the city limits .",

  "To Orosius , Constantine was the first Christian Roman emperor , except for Philip ( he was the \" primus imperatorum Christianus , excepto Philippo \" ) . He probably took this judgment from Jerome — he had met the author in Bethlehem in 415 , while on assignment from Augustine of Hippo . Although his judgment is thus not independent of Jerome , Shahîd contends that it is nonetheless valuable since Orosius did not have a bias towards either emperor . It presents Philip in the role Christian history merited : as precursor to Constantine . Because Orosius ' Historiae adversum paganos served as the standard manual of universal history during the middle ages , his judgment on this matter was inherited , and generally accepted , by medieval European writers .",

This is helpful because low @-@ frequency analog signals cannot be effectively transmitted over free space .

  "Pedro de Alvarado and his army advanced along the Pacific coast unopposed until they reached the Samalá River in western Guatemala . This region formed a part of the K 'iche ' kingdom , and a K 'iche ' army tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Spanish from crossing the river . Once across , the conquistadors ransacked nearby settlements in an effort to terrorise the K 'iche ' . On 8 February 1524 Alvarado 's army fought a battle at Xetulul , called Zapotitlán by his Mexican allies ( modern San Francisco Zapotitlán ) . Although suffering many injuries inflicted by defending K 'iche ' archers , the Spanish and their allies stormed the town and set up camp in the marketplace . Alvarado then turned to head upriver into the Sierra Madre mountains towards the K 'iche ' heartlands , crossing the pass into the fertile valley of Quetzaltenango . On 12 February 1524 Alvarado 's Mexican allies were ambushed in the pass and driven back by K 'iche ' warriors but the Spanish cavalry charge that followed was a shock for the K 'iche ' , who had never before seen horses . The cavalry scattered the K 'iche ' and the army crossed to the city of Xelaju ( modern Quetzaltenango ) only to find it deserted . Although the common view is that the K 'iche ' prince Tecun Uman died in the later battle near Olintepeque , the Spanish accounts are clear that at least one and possibly two of the lords of Q 'umarkaj died in the fierce battles upon the initial approach to Quetzaltenango . The death of Tecun Uman is said to have taken place in the battle of El Pinar , and local tradition has his death taking place on the Llanos de Urbina ( Plains of Urbina ) , upon the approach to Quetzaltenango near the modern village of Cantel . Pedro de Alvarado , in his third letter to Hernán Cortés , describes the death of one of the four lords of Q 'umarkaj upon the approach to Quetzaltenango . The letter was dated 11 April 1524 and was written during his stay at Q 'umarkaj . Almost a week later , on 18 February 1524 , a K 'iche ' army confronted the Spanish army in the Quetzaltenango valley and were comprehensively defeated ; many K 'iche ' nobles were among the dead . Such were the numbers of K 'iche ' dead that Olintepeque was given the name Xequiquel , roughly meaning \" bathed in blood \" . In the early 17th century , the grandson of the K 'iche ' king informed the alcalde mayor ( the highest colonial official at the time ) that the K 'iche ' army that had marched out of Q 'umarkaj to confront the invaders numbered 30 @,@ 000 warriors , a claim that is considered credible by modern scholars . This battle exhausted the K 'iche ' militarily and they asked for peace and offered tribute , inviting Pedro de Alvarado into their capital Q 'umarkaj , which was known as Tecpan Utatlan to the Nahuatl @-@ speaking allies of the Spanish . Alvarado was deeply suspicious of the K 'iche ' intentions but accepted the offer and marched to Q 'umarkaj with his army .",

Many composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries wrote sentimental works for female voice ; by contrast , songs by Vaughan Williams 's songs such as \" The Vagabond \" from Songs of Travel , to words by Robert Louis Stevenson , are \" a particularly masculine breath of fresh air \" ( Fuller ) , \" virile open @-@ air verses \" ( Kennedy ) .

  "This catch @-@ all category refers to other seabird strategies that involve the next trophic level up . Kleptoparasites are seabirds that make a part of their living stealing food of other seabirds . Most famously , frigatebirds and skuas engage in this behaviour , although gulls , terns and other species will steal food opportunistically . The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy . Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species , and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting . A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40 % of the food they needed , and on average obtained only 5 % . Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises , as will giant petrels .

To make it so you can hear both things at once \" . Goodmanson also noted that the fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album 's production . He explained : \" The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want . Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass , so you can hear the bass line .

Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas , it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room , dressing room , and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall . These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest , such as a visiting monarch . While Belton does have a saloon at its centre , enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it . The possible reason for this unusual layout is that , while the Brownlows possessed great wealth , their title was only a baronetcy , and their fortune was barely a century old . They would have been regarded as gentry , not aristocracy . As a result , building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest . However , the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows ' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695 .

  "Unhexquadium should be a soft metal like mercury , and metallic unhexquadium should have a high melting point as it is predicted to bond covalently . It is also expected to be a soft Lewis acid and have Ahrlands softness parameter close to 4 eV . It should also have some similarities to ununoctium as well as to the other group 12 elements . Unhexquadium should be at most moderately reactive , having a first ionization energy that should be around 685 kJ / mol , comparable to that of molybdenum . Due to the lanthanide , actinide , and superactinide contractions , unhexquadium should have a metallic radius of only 158 pm , very close to that of the much lighter magnesium , despite its being expected to have an atomic weight of around 474 u , about 19 @.@ 5 times as much as that of magnesium . This small radius and high weight cause it to be expected to have an extremely high density of around 46 g · cm − 3 , over twice that of osmium , currently the most dense element known , at 22 @.@ 61 g · cm − 3 ; unhexquadium should be the second most dense element in the first 9 periods of the periodic table , with only its neighbour unhextrium ( element 163 ) being more dense ( at 47 g · cm − 3 ) . Metallic unhexquadium should be quite stable , as the 8s and 8p1 / 2 electrons are very deeply buried in the electron core and only the 7d electrons are available for bonding . Metallic unhexquadium should have a very large cohesive energy due to its covalent bonds , most probably resulting in a high melting point .",

Simeon I , who had long harboured ambitions to claim an imperial title for himself , took the opportunity to wage war . With the Byzantine Empire in disarray following Alexander 's death in June 913 , the Bulgarians reached Constantinople unopposed and forced the regency of the infant Constantine VII ( r . 913 – 959 ) to recognize Simeon I as emperor ( in Bulgarian , Tsar ) . Following a palace coup in 914 , the new Byzantine regency revoked the concessions to the Bulgarians and summoned the whole army , including the troops in Asia Minor , to deal with the Bulgarian threat once and all . In the decisive battle of Achelous in 917 the Byzantine forces were completely annihilated , leaving the Bulgarians in charge of the Balkans .

  "The date of Michael Bourtzes 's birth is unknown , but must be placed sometime between 930 and 935 . He is first mentioned in late 968 , when he was appointed by Emperor Nikephoros II Phokas ( reigned 963 – 969 ) as patrikios and strategos of the small theme of Mauron Oros ( \" Black Mountain \" ) , on the southern outliers of the Amanus Mountains .

Acting against Nikephoros 's orders not to assault the city in his absence , in the late autumn of 969 , Bourtzes persuaded a traitor inside the city to surrender one of the wall 's main towers , which he then promptly occupied on 28 October . He then defended this post against repeated attacks of the city 's defenders for three days , until the reinforcements led by the stratopedarches Peter arrived and secured the city for the Byzantines . Despite his major role in this success , Bourtzes 's reward was distinctly lacking : angry at him for disobeying his orders , or , according to another account , for laying fire and destroying much of the city , Emperor Nikephoros dismissed him from his post and appointed a kinsman of his , Eustathios Maleinos , as the first governor of Antioch .",

  "Lord North 's government was chiefly concerned with discontent in America . To assuage American opinion most of the custom duties were withdrawn , except for the tea duty , which in George 's words was \" one tax to keep up the right [ to levy taxes ] \" . In 1773 , the tea ships moored in Boston Harbor were boarded by colonists and the tea thrown overboard , an event that became known as the Boston Tea Party . In Britain , opinion hardened against the colonists , with Chatham now agreeing with North that the destruction of the tea was \" certainly criminal \" . With the clear support of Parliament , Lord North introduced measures , which were called the Intolerable Acts by the colonists : the Port of Boston was shut down and the charter of Massachusetts was altered so that the upper house of the legislature was appointed by the Crown instead of elected by the lower house . Up to this point , in the words of Professor Peter Thomas , George 's \" hopes were centred on a political solution , and he always bowed to his cabinet 's opinions even when sceptical of their success .

  "When a tropical cyclone crosses the subtropical ridge axis , normally through a break in the high @-@ pressure area caused by a system traversing the Westerlies , its general track around the high @-@ pressure area is deflected significantly by winds moving towards the general low @-@ pressure area to its north . When the cyclone track becomes strongly poleward with an easterly component , the cyclone has begun recurvature , entering the Westerlies .

  "Externalizing disorders . Externalizing disorders ( i.e. , acting @-@ out disorders ) show a clearer link to delayed gratification , since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control . For example , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification in children and adolescents , as are substance abuse , gambling , and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults . In a 2010 study , teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol , or to smoke cigarettes or marijuana . Interestingly , a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ ( in other words , ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ ) . This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification , and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation .",

  "When the Lutheran Reformation was brought to Sweden from Germany via Denmark after the election of Gustav Vasa in 1523 , the movement from the start had its own distinct characteristics . The development of Swedish liturgy was , in part , thanks to Olavus Petri , which is sometimes regarded as his most important work . His Swedish Mass , 1531 remained in use , with only slight modifications , until the twentieth century . The Swedish Mass draws from a number of different sources , though Luther ’ s Formulae Missae is apparent in regards to the Eucharistic structure This included revising the calendar along similar lines as those in Germany . Laurentius Petri further revised the Swedish Mass 1557 . In large part , the Swedish liturgy retained “ vestments , altars and frontals , gold and silver chalices and patens ” and many other “ popish ” customs . Following Laurentius ’ death in 1573 , King John III embarked on a separate , though similar , religious policy more conciliatory towards Catholicism . Much of his work was in the area of liturgy and his Nova Ordinantia reinstated much of the sanctoral cycle from the Old Swedish Mass , reviving the feasts of St. Mary Magdalene , St. Lawrence , Corpus Christi , and the Assumption and Nativity of the Virgin Mary .

  "The work 's realism attracted a large amount of commentary when it was first exhibited .

  "All genes known so far to be linked to HHT code for proteins in the TGF @-@ β signaling pathway . This is a group of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily ( the transforming growth factor beta , bone morphogenetic protein and growth differentiation factor classes ) , specifically BMP9 / GDF2 and BMP10 . The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane ; these then activate other proteins , eventually influencing cellular behavior in a number of ways such as cellular survival , proliferation ( increasing in number ) and differentiation ( becoming more specialized ) . For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced , a combination of proteins is needed : two each of two types of serine / threonine @-@ specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin . When bound to the hormone , the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate ( transfer phosphate ) onto type I receptor proteins ( of which Alk @-@ 1 is one ) , which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins ( chiefly SMAD1 , SMAD5 and SMAD8 ) . These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes . In addition to the SMAD pathway , the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway , which has additional actions on the behavior of cells . Both Alk @-@ 1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium , perhaps explaining why HHT @-@ causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems .

  "Varahi is a ratri devata ( night goddess ) and is sometimes called Dhruma Varahi ( \" dark Varahi \" ) and Dhumavati ( \" goddess of darkness \" ) . According to Tantra , Varahi should be worshipped after sunset and before sunrise . Parsurama Kalpasutra explicitly states that the time of worship is the middle of the night . Shaktas worship Varahi by secretive Vamamarga Tantric practices , which are particularly associated with worship by panchamakara – wine , fish , grain , meat , and ritual copulation . These practices are observed in the Kalaratri temple on the bank of the Ganges , where worship is offered to Varahi only in the night ; the shrine is closed during the day . Shaktas consider Varahi to be a manifestation of the goddess Lalita Tripurasundari or as \" Dandanayika \" or \" Dandanatha \" – the commander @-@ general of Lalita 's army . The Sri Vidya tradition of Shaktism elevates Varahi to the status of Para Vidya ( \" transcendental knowledge \" ) . The Devi mahatmya suggests evoking Varahi for longevity . Thirty yantras and thirty mantras are prescribed for the worship of Varahi and to acquire siddhis by her favour . This , according to the scholar Rath , indicates her power .

  "As the metal mining industry on which it depended declined , and prices for staple goods rose sharply resulting from fluctuations in food prices and of the American Civil War , the economy of Cornwall collapsed .

Between 1861 and 1900 at least 35 % of Cornish women aged 15 – 24 moved to other parts of the UK , and over 26 % left the country altogether . Although the male emigrants generally found work in mines in their new places of settlement , or put their mining skills to use digging tunnels for the rapidly growing railway networks , the jobs traditionally done by bal maidens , where they still existed , were usually done by locally recruited men or boys , and the tradition of female Cornish mine labour died out in emigrant families .",

  "However , the events of April to June 1940 overturned the balance of naval and air power , as the Germans conquered Denmark , Norway , The Netherlands , Belgium and France . The occupation of these countries permitted the Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine to operate from French ports on the Atlantic coast , hundreds of miles closer to the Atlantic shipping lanes . German medium bombers could also now reach British ports on the country 's westernmost and northernmost coasts . The advantage now enjoyed by the Germans allowed them to interdict merchant shipping supplying food and war materials to Britain much more effectively which had the potential to starve Britain . While merchant shipping was suffering these losses , Coastal Command had proven ineffective at countering German air and sea attacks on shipping . In particular , it was ineffective at protecting English Channel convoys , which were forced to abandon operations for a few months , starting in July 1940 . RAF Fighter Command was given the task as it enjoyed the majority of RAF resources at the time . The objectives of strategic air attack and defence predominated in the RAF , despite the warning signs from 1914 to 1918 , that U @-@ boats would become a serious threat again , and the experience that aircraft were a suitable counter to their operations .

  "The Latin tradition consists of three authors writing in the later 4th and early 5th centuries — Jerome , Orosius , and Vincent of Lérins .

  "At the beginning of the period , most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile , settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams , allocated in run rigs , of \" runs \" ( furrows ) and \" rigs \" ( ridges ) , to tenant farmers . They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land , helping to offset the problems of extreme weather conditions . In this era , a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged as the dominant form as Scottish society was largely divided between a few large estate holders and a large number of workers . This had a major impact on the landscape as feudal systems of ownership were abandoned and land holdings reorganised . This process also facilitated the Scottish Agricultural Revolution that further changed the Scottish landscape from the first half of the eighteenth century . This was the beginning of a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields , carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads .",

  "Schizophrenia is associated with subtle differences in brain structures , found in forty to fifty percent of cases , and in brain chemistry during acute psychotic states . Studies using neuropsychological tests and brain imaging technologies such as fMRI and PET to examine functional differences in brain activity have shown that differences seem to occur most commonly in the frontal lobes , hippocampus and temporal lobes . Reductions in brain volume , smaller than those found in Alzheimer 's disease , have been reported in areas of the frontal cortex and temporal lobes . It is uncertain whether these volumetric changes are progressive or exist prior to the onset of the disease . These differences have been linked to the neurocognitive deficits often associated with schizophrenia . Because neural circuits are altered , it has alternatively been suggested that schizophrenia should be thought of as a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders . There has been debate on whether treatment with antipsychotics can itself cause reduction of brain volume .",

  "Keats realized that he could never have Love , could not fulfil his Ambition , and could not spend his time with Poesy . The conclusion of \" Ode to Indolence \" is a dismissal of both the images and his poetry as figures that would only mislead him . Even indolence itself seems unattainable ; Andrew Motion writes that the figures force Keats to regard indolence as \" the privilege of the leisured class to which he did not belong . \" If the poem is read as the final poem in the 1819 ode series , \" Ode on Indolence \" suggests that Keats is resigned to giving up his career as a poet because poetry cannot give him the immortality he wanted from it . Ironically , the poem provided Keats with such immortality . Besides the biographical component , the poem also describes Keats 's belief that his works should capture the beauty of art while acknowledging the harshness of life . In this way , the poems as a group capture Keats 's philosophy of negative capability , the concept of living with unreconciled contradictory views , by trying to reconcile Keats 's desire to write poetry and his inability to do so by abandoning poetry altogether and accepting life as it is .",

  "Exmoor is an upland area formed almost exclusively from sedimentary rocks dating from the Devonian and early Carboniferous periods . The name of the geological period and system , ' Devonian ' , comes from Devon , as rocks of that age were first studied and described here . With the exception of a suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde ( within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself ) , all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group , which comprises a mix of gritstones , sandstones , slates , shales , limestone , siltstones and mudstones . Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil . The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member ( formerly ' Formation ' ) of the Hangman Sandstone Formation ( formerly ' Group ' ) . The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset . These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions . As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation , the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform . The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet , acid soil .",

The Cliffords preferred their properties in Yorkshire to their dilapidated castles in Westmorland , which had been ravaged by wars with Scotland . Brougham Castle is not known to have been in use as a residence again until 1421 , when a man was accused of forging coins in the castle . Although little is known about Brougham during this period , historians believe it likely that repairs were undertaken , and a rivalry emerged between the Clifford family and the House of Neville that would later have consequences for Brougham . The familial enmity meant that the Earl of Salisbury , a Neville , used his position as lord of Penrith to antagonise the Cliffords ; it is likely that Brougham Castle was kept garrisoned due to its proximity to Penrith .

  "In 1974 , Thulborn suggested that the large tusks of heterodontosaurids represented a secondary sex characteristic . According to this theory , only adult male individuals would have possessed fully developed tusks ; the holotype specimen of the related Abrictosaurus , which lacked tusks altogether , would have represented a female . This hypothesis was questioned by palaeontologist Richard Butler and colleagues in 2006 , who argued that the juvenile skull SAM @-@ PK @-@ K10487 possessed tusks despite its early developmental state . At this state , secondary sex characteristics are not expected . Furthermore , tusks are present in almost all known Heterodontosaurus skulls ; the presence of sexual dimorphism however would suggest a 50 : 50 ratio between individuals bearing tusks and those lacking tusks . The only exception is the holotype specimen of Abrictosaurus ; the lack of tusks in this individual is interpreted as a specialisation of this particular genus .",

  "For Rhodes , the agreement Moffat had made with Lobengula was crucial as it bought time that allowed him to devote the necessary attention to the final amalgamation of the South African diamond interests . A possible way out of the situation for Lobengula was to lead another Matabele migration across the Zambezi , but Rhodes hoped to keep the king where he was for the moment as a buffer against Boer expansion . In March 1888 , Rhodes bought out the company of his last competitor , the circus showman turned diamond millionaire Barney Barnato , to form De Beers Consolidated Mines , a sprawling national monopoly that controlled 90 % of world diamond production .

  "Madonna 's motive for baring her breasts to the public feels more like personal gratification , less like commitment to a cause . She 's not out to change the world . Let 's face it : Few people get erotic in front of millions of viewers for purely selfless political reasons . It 's hard to escape the view of Madonna as a difficult Catholic adolescent aiming the finger at everything repressive . And many of her songs are addressed to an authority figure of her youth – from God and Jesus Christ to her own father . The heart of Madonna 's outrageousness seems to lie beneath her liberal rationales , as if she 's acting out something private and the world is her couch , not to mention her bank . Her politics are largely Electral .",

  "Myrmecia is one of the best @-@ known genera of ants . Myrmecia ants usually display defensive behavior only around their nests , and are more timid while foraging . However , most species are extremely aggressive towards intruders ; a few , such as M. tarsata , are timid , and the workers retreat into their nest instead of pursuing the intruder . If a nest is disturbed , a large force of workers rapidly swarm out of their nest to attack and kill the intruder . Some species , particularly those of the M. nigrocincta and M. pilosula species groups , are capable of jumping several inches when they are agitated after their nest has been disturbed ; jumper ants propel their jumps by a sudden extension of its middle and hind legs . M. pyriformis is considered the most dangerous ant in the world by the Guinness World Records .

Club felt the script balanced all the character subplots extremely well , writing , \" It 's this ability to hold down the ' situation ' part of situation comedy , while never scrimping on the comedy , that makes it the class of the NBC lineup — the purest , if not the best , sitcom on the air . \" Pierce also complimented the final scene between Leslie and Mark , which he said brought the season to \" a touching full circle \" . IGN writer Matt Fowler ranked the episode as \" outstanding \" and claimed it highlighted the strengths of Leslie , by emphasizing the passion with which she views her job , and Ron , by showing how much he cares for his employees even though he hates his job . Fowler said Schneider 's departure was handled well , even though he described Mark as the show 's least interesting character .

Sepinwall praised the chemistry between Poehler and Scott , as well as Lowe 's comedic performance , but said the April and Andy romantic subplot was less consistently effective than the similar pairing between Jim and Pam Halpert on the NBC comedy , The Office .",

  "At 0930 UTC on August 17 , the center of Hurricane Dean passed into the Caribbean Sea through the Saint Lucia Channel between the islands of Martinique and St. Lucia . The northern eyewall passed over Martinique where a weather station in the island 's capital of Fort @-@ de @-@ France reported 13 in ( 33 cm ) of rainfall . By this time the eyewall had closed , forming a distinct eye , and in an environment of low wind shear and increasing ocean temperature the hurricane began to intensify rapidly . Hurricane Dean strengthened to a Category 3 hurricane by the evening of August 17 . Satellite imagery showed that a well defined eye and numerous cyclonically curved convective bands remained over the Lesser Antilles . That evening , another reconnaissance aircraft reached the hurricane and discovered that it had strengthened into a Category 4 hurricane , and by 0600 UTC on August 18 , Dean reached Category 5 intensity for the first time with 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) winds . The storm 's wind radii increased in all quadrants as the storm grew in both intensity and size . At 0800 UTC August 18 , Hurricane Dean passed directly over NOAA sea buoy 42059 which reported a significant wave height ( average size of the largest 33 % of waves ) of 33 ft ( 10 m ) . On August 18 , Hurricane Dean developed a double eyewall , indicating that an eyewall replacement cycle was taking place and causing short term fluctuations in intensity as Dean weakened back to a Category 4 hurricane . That afternoon the hurricane continued to improve its outflow , and its numerous spiral bands gave it a well defined satellite presentation . Hurricane Dean finished the eyewall replacement cycle early on August 19 with some trochiodal wobbles .",

  "The castle 's design was unsatisfactory , as its guns could not be angled so to fire down into the harbour , and its defences were considered vulnerable to attack . To mitigate this , an additional blockhouse was probably constructed below , closer to the water , but eventually a new fortification , the Star Castle , was built instead on the neighbouring island of St Mary 's , which became the main fort in the Scilly Isles . In the aftermath of the English Civil War , the Scilly Isles were held by the Royalist sympathisers of King Charles I , who gave the castle its current name . The islands were then attacked by a Parliamentary force led by Sir Robert Blake in 1651 , who landed on Tresco but bypassed the fort as he took the island . Its Royalist defenders blew up parts of the castle as they left , and some of its stone appears to have been used to build the newer Cromwell 's Castle by the harbour .",

  "Laid down at the Thames Ironworks shipyard in London , England in 1865 , the ship was originally ordered by the Ottoman Empire as the Fatikh .

  "By the end of the thirteenth century , several offences against either one 's lord , or one 's king , were treasonable . High treason , defined as transgressions against the sovereign , was first codified during King Edward III 's reign by the Treason Act 1351 . It clarified exactly what crimes constituted treason , following earlier , somewhat \" over zealous \" interpretations of England 's legal codes .

High treason remained distinct though , from what became known as petty treason : the killing of a lawful superior , such as a husband by his wife .

Koht responded with a speech in which he said that the Allies had nothing to gain by interfering with Norwegian shipping lanes — the British had a more significant trade with Norway than the Germans . The next day the Allies decided to launch a mining operation on the Norwegian coast , and to land troops at Narvik in case the Germans responded to the mining by landing in Norway . Shortly before the mining was carried out , Koht warned the British that no further neutrality violations would be tolerated , and that in the future the Norwegians would respond with force . The Germans too repeatedly violated Norwegian neutrality , and , following a visit from the Norwegian fascist leader Vidkun Quisling to Hitler in December 1939 , began serious planning for a possible occupation of Norway . Following the Altmark Incident , Hitler ordered the invasion of Norway . In response to the British mining operation on 8 April 1940 , the Norwegian government lodged formal protests with the British and French governments , while secretly remaining set on avoiding war with the Allies at all cost . Koht told the Norwegian parliament that he believed that the Allies were trying to bring Norway into the war . The Allied mining of the Norwegian coast coincidentally distracted the Norwegian government from realising that large German forces had been on their way to invade Norway for several days prior .",

  "Both Boycott and McGregor Blacker were involved in a protracted dispute with Mr Carr , the agent for the Achill Church Mission Estate , from whom McGregor Blacker leased the lands , and Mr O 'Donnell , Carr 's bailiff . The dispute began when Boycott and Carr supported different sets of candidates in elections for the Board of Guardians to the Church Mission Estate , and Boycott 's candidates won .

Each level features an arrangement of approximately one hundred blue \" pegs \" , positioned to correspond with the level 's background picture , inside of three walls on the top and sides ( leaving the bottom opened ) , along with other fixed and moving features . The goal of each level is to clear the board of the twenty @-@ five random pegs that are turned orange at the start of the level , by using a ball launcher located at the top center of the screen to strike one or more of the pegs . Pegs light up when hit , and once the ball either falls through the bottom of the screen or is caught by the ball catcher that moves back and forth along the bottom in a fixed manner , the pegs will be removed . Struck pegs are also removed if the ball is stuck on them . The player begins each level with ten balls ( twelve on the non @-@ Touch iPod version ) to clear the orange pegs , but may earn more by landing the ball in the ball catcher , or by earning high scores on single shots . Failure to clear the board with the allotted number of balls will require the player to restart the level , while completing this objective will allow the player to progress forward to the next board .",

  "In his writing , Villani states that he considers Florence to be the \" daughter and creation of Rome , \" but asserts Rome 's decline and Florence 's rise as a great city compelled him to lay out a detailed history of the city . To emphasize the imperial greatness of Florentine history , Villani also asserted that the city was given a second founding when it was rebuilt by Charlemagne ( r . 800 – 814 as Holy Roman Emperor ) — which was absent from the Chronica de origine civitatis . Historian J.K. Hyde writes that the idea of Florence being the daughter of Rome would have given the Florentines a sense of destiny , while the second founding by Charlemagne provided historical context for alliance with France , which Hyde calls \" the touchstone of Guelphism \" . Villani 's reasoning for Rome 's decline was the schisms of the Church and rebellion against the papal institution , while the ascension of Otto I , Holy Roman Emperor ( r . 962 – 973 ) allowed for the conditions of Florence 's rise against enemies of papal authority , such as Florentine @-@ conquered Fiesole . Villani was certain that the Republic of Florence had experienced a great setback on its path to glory with the defeat of the Guelphs by the Ghibellines at the Battle of Montaperti in 1260 . Despite this , Villani states that the paramount prosperity and tranquility of the city by 1293 was evidenced by the fact that its gates were no longer locked at night and that indirect taxes such as the gate fee ( common in times of war ) were not levied . Historian Felicity Ratté states that the validity of this comment should be heavily scrutinized considering the Florence statutes of 1290 that designated employment for individuals in charge of locking the city gates . Villani also contradicts himself by writing of a night attack on Florence in 1323 which clearly demonstrates the fact that the gates were locked at night .",

  "As he matured , Bojić was influenced by the works of Irish writer Oscar Wilde , particularly the play Salome , which was being performed at the National Theatre in Belgrade during Bojić 's university years . The play influenced Bojić to such an extent that he later composed a poem of the same name .

  "Newton ( test plate ) interferometry is frequently used in the optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured . Fig . 13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats at different stages of completion , showing the different patterns of interference fringes . The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats , and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source . The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere , resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands . The surface in the left photo is nearly flat , indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals . The surface in the right photo is uneven , resulting in a pattern of curved fringes . Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used , so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes . The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method . To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat , any of several procedures may be adopted . One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat . If one observes the fringes in white light , the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation . Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position . These sorts of maneuvers , while common in the optical shop , are not suitable in a formal testing environment . When the flats are ready for sale , they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification .",
