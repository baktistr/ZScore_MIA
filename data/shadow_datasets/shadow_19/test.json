In a 1999 interview with New York Times columnist William Safire , the Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said the idea had first been suggested by the Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew , but Goh felt that it was not yet the right time to set it up . The following year , the Government decided to go ahead despite its fear of potential public disorder , as the idea enjoyed widespread support from the public and civil society groups . During a Parliamentary debate on the issue on 25 April 2000 , opposition Member of Parliament Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam asked the Minister for Home Affairs Wong Kan Seng whether this was a \" mere show \" or whether the Government was serious about promoting free speech in Singapore . If the latter , he asked if the Minister would agree to an open debate with the Workers ' Party of Singapore outside Parliament . In response , Wong said there was nothing to prevent Jeyaretnam from making a speech at Speakers ' Corner , but that the public forum for a proper policy debate was in Parliament :",

  "At a time when women had trouble finding work and workers were often oppressed , Boyce felt their rights were important : his businesses employed many women and he supported labor unions . His newspapers often carried stories about the \" nobility of labor \" . His businesses were able to pay out wages and benefits during the Panic of 1893 , a time when many businesses were laying off workers and cutting wages . During the Pullman Strike of the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1894 , which spread to 20 companies in over half the states , Boyce called Eugene V. Debs , the socialist labor national leader of the American Railway Union , a \" great labor leader \" and industrialist George Pullman , inventor of the railroad passenger and sleeping car , the man \" who caused all the trouble \" ( then current labor and social / political strife of the 1890s ) . In 1901 when the Boyce Paper Manufacturing Company in Marseilles , Illinois , burned down , he paid the workers immediately and then hired them back as construction workers to rebuild the paper mill so they would not lose income . Yet , he was also protective of his money . In late 1894 , when two of his workers were injured by a fallen smokestack and won $ 2 @,@ 000 each in a court judgment , Boyce appealed the case all the way to the Supreme Court of Illinois , and lost .

The population had been depleted to three males and 12 females that had been so widely dispersed that no mating in the wild had occurred .

The 15 remaining tortoises were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station in 1971 for a captive breeding program and , in the following 33 years , they gave rise to over 1 @,@ 200 progeny which were released onto their home island and have since begun to reproduce naturally .",
  "Historical records report that Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people , and that its residents were deported to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River . The alleged population transfer was a resumption of a policy that had been planned since 138 BC . The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting its residents . Modern historians doubt the event happened . The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible , and nothing has been found to verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1 , something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control . There was only one town of Han settlers , Dongye , in Minyue . Dongye was built where the Min River meets the sea , around the time of Emperor Wu 's reign . It is more likely that the assimilation of Minyue into the culture of the Han empire happened later in the dynasty .",

  "The rock martin feeds mainly on insects caught in flight , although it will occasionally feed on the ground . When breeding , birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and feed close to the nesting territory . At other times , they may hunt low over open ground . The insects caught depend on what is locally available , but may include mosquitoes and other flies , Hymenoptera , ants and beetles . This martin often feeds alone , but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects , and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300 may form where food is abundant . Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas . Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt , relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns .",

  "Charles died in 1685 and his brother succeeded him as James VII of Scotland ( and II of England ) . James put Catholics in key positions in the government and even attendance at a conventicle was made punishable by death . He disregarded parliament , purged the Council and forced through religious toleration to Roman Catholics , alienating his Protestant subjects . The failure of an invasion , led by Archibald Campbell , 9th Earl of Argyll , and timed to co @-@ ordinate with the Duke of Monmouth 's rebellion in England , demonstrated the strength of the regime . It was believed that the king would be succeeded by his daughter Mary , a Protestant and the wife of William of Orange , Stadtholder of the Netherlands , but when in 1688 , James produced a male heir , James Francis Edward Stuart , it was clear that his policies would outlive him . An invitation by seven leading Englishmen led William to land in England with 40 @,@ 000 men , and James fled , leading to the almost bloodless \" Glorious Revolution \" . William called the Estates in Scotland , and as his supporters proved dominant , James ' support collapsed . The Estates issued a Claim of Right that suggested that James had forfeited the crown by his actions ( in contrast to England , which relied on the legal fiction of an abdication ) and offered it to William and Mary , which William accepted , along with limitations on royal power . The final settlement restored Presbyterianism and abolished the bishops , who had generally supported James .

  "In 1895 , on the orders of the Patriarch of Karlovci , Georgije I , the Congress Board of Sremski Karlovci commissioned the young realist Paja Jovanović to compose Migration of the Serbs , intending for it to be displayed as part of the Serb pavilion . The painting was one of two works that Jovanović was hired to paint for the Exhibition , the other being the Vršac triptych , which was commissioned by the Vršac city council . In the eyes of the clergy , Migration of the Serbs would help legitimize Serb claims to religious autonomy and partial self @-@ administration in Austria @-@ Hungary . The official Church narrative held that Leopold had requested that the Serbs of Kosovo , Macedonia and the Sandžak settle the Ottoman – Habsburg frontier to create a buffer against further Ottoman encroachment , and Church officials intended for Jovanović 's painting to reflect this view . Hence , the painting had significant political implications . Habsburg Serbs asserted that the agreement between Arsenije and Leopold legitimized their claim to the lands they inhabited , while Croatian nationalists decried the Serbs as \" uninvited guests \" who only acquired Leopold 's pledge of autonomy after they had migrated to the Habsburg lands . Migration of the Serbs was thus intended to challenge the historical and political narratives being forwarded by the Croatian and Hungarian painters whose works were also going to be displayed .",

Mogulescu 's audition for Goldfaden was a scene from Vlăduţu Mamei ( Mama 's Boy ) , which formed the basis later that year for Goldfaden 's light comedy Shemdrik , oder Die Komishe Chaseneh ( Shmendrik or The Comical Wedding ) , starring Mogulescu as the almost painfully clueless and hapless young man ( a role later famously played in New York and elsewhere by actress Molly Picon ) .",
  "Epidemiology is used to break the chain of infection in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases . Control measures are used that are based on knowledge of how the virus is transmitted . It is important to find the source , or sources , of the outbreak and to identify the virus . Once the virus has been identified , the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines . When vaccines are not available , sanitation and disinfection can be effective . Often , infected people are isolated from the rest of the community , and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine . To control the outbreak of foot @-@ and @-@ mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001 , thousands of cattle were slaughtered . Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms . Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks , but are known for most infections . Somewhat overlapping , but mainly following the incubation period , there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal . This , too , is known for many viral infections , and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks . When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population , community , or region , they are called epidemics . If outbreaks spread worldwide , they are called pandemics .",

  "Oxidative phosphorylation works by using energy @-@ releasing chemical reactions to drive energy @-@ requiring reactions : The two sets of reactions are said to be coupled . This means one cannot occur without the other . The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain , from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen , is an exergonic process – it releases energy , whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process , which requires an input of energy . Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane , and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane , in a process called chemiosmosis .

Pompey was decisively defeated in the Battle of Pharsalus in 48 BC despite outnumbering Caesar 's forces two to one . Pompey fled again , this time to Egypt , where he was murdered in an attempt to ingratiate the country with Caesar and avoid a war with Rome .",

  "The precursor disturbance to Tropical Storm Arlene dropped heavy rainfall over Central America . As a result , 20 fatalities occurred , all of which were from a mudslide in El Salvador . Heavy rainfall also produced heavy rainfall on the Yucatán Peninsula . After Arlene became a tropical cyclone , rainfall in Mexico inundated areas of Campeche , where damage totaled US $ 33 million . In total , five people were killed in Mexico . Flood damage in South Texas was extensive , with widespread urban flooding and road closures . Entire plots of farmland were inundated by torrential rains brought by Arlene . The landfalling Arlene interacted with a passing cold front which helped to produce showers further northeast , though damage in those locales was comparatively less severe .

  "The impact of the Renaissance on Scottish architecture has been seen as occurring in two distinct phases . First , from the early fifteenth century the selective use of Romanesque forms in church architecture , to be followed by a second phase of more directly influenced Renaissance palace building from the late fifteenth century . The re @-@ adoption of low @-@ massive church building with round arches and pillars , in contrast to the Gothic perpendicular style that was particularly dominant in England in the late Medieval era , may have been influenced by close contacts with Rome and the Netherlands , and may have been a conscious reaction to English forms in favour of continental ones . It can be seen in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral , begun in 1406 , the facade of St Mary 's , Haddington from the 1460s and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone 's Kings College , Aberdeen ( 1500 – 9 ) . About forty collegiate churches were established in Scotland in late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries .

The JTWC indicated that 25W made a second landfall on the coast of Hainan , although the JMA did not make such mention , implying Nepartak 's center remained over the Gulf of Tonkin . Regardless , the cyclone 's circulation had obscured most of Hainan and the Gulf of Tonkin and reached into adjacent Vietnam , and its forward speed slowed to a crawl .

  "In his 1951 monograph for the World Health Organisation , Maternal Care and Mental Health , Bowlby put forward the hypothesis that \" the infant and young child should experience a warm , intimate , and continuous relationship with his mother in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment \" , the lack of which may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences . This was also published as Child Care and the Growth of Love for public consumption . The central proposition was influential but highly controversial .

  "The net could ensnare the secutor 's weapon to disarm him and snag away his shield to put him at a significant disadvantage . Other retiarius tricks were to whip the net at his opponent 's eyes to blind him and at his legs to trip him . The helmet of the secutor was smooth and round to avoid snagging the net . In most cases , the secutor knew to expect the net @-@ man 's tactics and tried to intercept and hold on to the weapon , possibly unsteadying his enemy by yanking on the net . In such danger , the retiarius could sever the drawstring from his wrist with his dagger . The secutor stood by a lost net and left little chance to recover it . Speculation surrounds the frequency with which the retiarius used his net . Extant imagery rarely shows gladiators of the type with a net , yet the class is named for the device , and Juvenal uses the net to quickly identify a retiarius in his satires . The discrepancy may simply be a case of artistic licence ; other types of gladiator are often shown without their weapons but can be assumed to be holding them due to their stance , and a net is a particularly difficult weapon to depict . The lack of nets in retiarius images may show gladiators who have already lost the weapon in the fight . Another possibility is that some retiarii simply did not use nets .",

  "The majority of eukaryotic genes are stored on a set of large , linear chromosomes . The chromosomes are packed within the nucleus in complex with storage proteins called histones to form a unit called a nucleosome . DNA packaged and condensed in this way is called chromatin . The manner in which DNA is stored on the histones , as well as chemical modifications of the histone itself , regulate whether a particular region of DNA is accessible for gene expression . In addition to genes , eukaryotic chromosomes contain sequences involved in ensuring that the DNA is copied without degradation of end regions and sorted into daughter cells during cell division : replication origins , telomeres and the centromere . Replication origins are the sequence regions where DNA replication is initiated to make two copies of the chromosome . Telomeres are long stretches of repetitive sequence that cap the ends of the linear chromosomes and prevent degradation of coding and regulatory regions during DNA replication . The length of the telomeres decreases each time the genome is replicated and has been implicated in the aging process . The centromere is required for binding spindle fibres to separate sister chromatids into daughter cells during cell division .",

The first was the Stainforth and Keadby Canal , which had been proposed by the Don Navigation shareholders in 1792 . Construction was started in 1793 and completed in 1802 , with John Thompson , the engineer to the Don Navigation Company , overseeing the work until his death in 1795 . It provided a link from Bramwith Lock to the River Trent , broadly following the old course of the River Don prior to Vermuyden 's improvements . Two years later , the Dearne and Dove Canal opened , connecting with the Barnsley Canal near Barnsley . The canal had also been proposed by Don Navigation shareholders in 1792 , and again John Thompson had overseen the initial construction . The third opening was in 1819 , when the Sheffield Canal connected the Tinsley terminus to the centre of Sheffield . There were several plans to create a link to the Chesterfield Canal , including one in 1793 by Benjamin Outram , and a proposal by Richard Gresley in 1810 for a North East Junction Canal , which would have linked to the Don at Rotherham , broadly following the modern ideas for the Rother Link .

  "Every two @-@ page book embedding is a special case of a planar embedding , because the union of two pages of a book is a space topologically equivalent to the whole plane . Therefore , every graph with book thickness two is automatically a planar graph . More precisely , the book thickness of a graph G is at most two if and only if G is a subgraph of a planar graph that has a Hamiltonian cycle . If a graph is given a two @-@ page embedding , it can be augmented to a planar Hamiltonian graph by adding ( into any page ) extra edges between any two consecutive vertices along the spine that are not already adjacent , and between the first and last spine vertices . The Goldner – Harary graph provides an example of a planar graph that does not have book thickness two : it is a maximal planar graph , so it is not possible to add any edges to it while preserving planarity , and it does not have a Hamiltonian cycle . Because of this characterization by Hamiltonian cycles , graphs that have two @-@ page book embeddings are also known as subhamiltonian graphs .",

  "Peruvians consume an estimated 65 million guinea pigs each year , and the animal is so entrenched in the culture that one famous painting of the Last Supper in the main cathedral in Cusco shows Christ and the 12 disciples dining on guinea pig . The animal remains an important aspect of certain religious events in both rural and urban areas of Peru . A religious celebration known as jaca tsariy ( \" collecting the cuys \" ) is a major festival in many villages in the Antonio Raimondi province of eastern Peru , and is celebrated in smaller ceremonies in Lima . It is a syncretistic event , combining elements of Catholicism and pre @-@ Columbian religious practices , and revolves around the celebration of local patron saints . The exact form the jaca tsariy takes differs from town to town ; in some localities , a sirvinti ( servant ) is appointed to go from door to door , collecting donations of guinea pigs , while in others , guinea pigs may be brought to a communal area to be released in a mock bullfight . Meals such as cuy chactado are always served as part of these festivities , and the killing and serving of the animal is framed by some communities as a symbolic satire of local politicians or important figures .

  "As with the chemical antioxidants , cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes . Here , the superoxide released by processes such as oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to hydrogen peroxide and then further reduced to give water . This detoxification pathway is the result of multiple enzymes , with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing hydrogen peroxide . As with antioxidant metabolites , the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another , but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative .",

  "The Giants were credited with pulling off the best deal of the year , with Larsen and Pierce – \" the little southpaw chatterbox \" – leading the team to the best record in the major leagues through early June . In a road game against the Reds on June 14 , he allowed a leadoff double to Vada Pinson , but was then accidentally spiked in the left ankle while covering first base on a groundout by Don Blasingame , an injury which required 14 stitches . Pulled from the game after just ⅓ of an inning , he took the loss when Pinson later scored and the Giants were shut out 8 – 0 . The injury likely cost him what would have been his eighth All @-@ Star selection , and he did not return to the field until he lasted only three innings in a loss on July 15 ; he then made three relief appearances before picking up a win on August 2 .

  "Tracheotomy consists of making an incision on the front of the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea . The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted ; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth . The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle ( referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively ) and both techniques are widely used in current practice . In order to limit the risk of damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves ( the nerves that control the voicebox ) , the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible . If only one of these nerves is damaged , the patient 's voice may be impaired ( dysphonia ) ; if both of the nerves are damaged , the patient will be unable to speak ( aphonia ) . In the acute setting , indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy .

  "Curtis , inspired by the fact that Van Gogh never knew he would be famous , had the idea for an episode centred on him . He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result . Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully , rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his madness . The episode was filmed in Trogir , Croatia and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings . The episode was watched by 6 @.@ 76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD . Reception to the episode varied , ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative . While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated over , most reviewers agreed that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster while Curran 's performance as Van Gogh was immensely praised .",

  "As the Sam & Max comics had a more adult tone , Steve Purcell expected LucasArts to cut back \" the edgier material \" from the game . However , he expressed that he was pleased with how LucasArts allowed him to stay close to his original vision for the game . The game 's various minigames were included to allow players to take a break from solving the main game 's puzzles and play something \" short and silly \" . Sam & Max Hit the Road also signified a major change in development for games on the SCUMM engine . The user interface was entirely rehauled from that introduced in Maniac Mansion and built upon in subsequent games . Instead of selecting a verb function from a list at the bottom of the screen and clicking on an in @-@ game entity , Sam & Max Hit the Road compressed all verb functions into the mouse cursor , which players could cycle through using the right @-@ mouse button . The inventory was also moved off the main screen to a sub @-@ screen accessible by a small icon on the screen .

  "The application of fire management tools requires making certain tradeoffs . Below is a sample of some costs and benefits associated with the tools currently used in fire management . Current approaches to fire management are an almost complete turnaround compared to historic approaches . In fact , it is commonly accepted that past fire suppression , along with other factors , has resulted in larger , more intense wildfire events which are seen today . In economic terms , expenditures used for wildfire suppression in the early 20th century have contributed to increased suppression costs which are being realized today .

  "As 1989 wore on , Prost continually claimed his Honda V10s were not producing the same amount of power as those in Senna 's car .

  "In 483 BC , a vast new seam of silver was found in the Athenian mines at Laurium . Themistocles proposed that the silver should be used to build a new fleet of triremes , ostensibly to assist in a long running war with Aegina . Plutarch suggests that Themistocles deliberately avoided mentioning Persia , believing that it was too distant a threat for the Athenians to act on , but that countering Persia was the fleet 's aim . Fine suggests that many Athenians must have admitted that such a fleet would be needed to resist the Persians , whose preparations for the coming campaign were known . Themistocles 's motion was passed easily , despite strong opposition from Aristides . Its passage was probably due to the desire of many of the poorer Athenians for paid employment as rowers in the fleet . It is unclear from the ancient sources whether 100 or 200 ships were initially authorised ; both Fine and Holland suggest that at first 100 ships were authorised and that a second vote increased this number to the levels seen during the second invasion . Aristides continued to oppose Themistocles 's policy , and tension between the two camps built over the winter , so the ostracism of 482 BC became a direct contest between Themistocles and Aristides . In what Holland characterises as , in essence , the world 's first referendum , Aristides was ostracised , and Themistocles 's policies were endorsed . Indeed , becoming aware of the Persian preparations for the coming invasion , the Athenians voted to build more ships than those for which Themistocles had asked . Thus , during the preparations for the Persian invasion , Themistocles had become the leading politician in Athens .",

  "One of the more peculiar physical features of this species is its external genitalia .

The glans extends about halfway down the shaft and is spiny except at the tip . In comparison , the glans of felids is short and spiny , while that of viverrids is smooth and long . The female fossa exhibits transient masculization , starting at about 1 – 2 years of age , developing an enlarged , spiny clitoris that resembles a male 's penis . The enlarged clitoris is supported by an os clitoridis , which decreases in size as the animal grows . The females do not have a pseudo @-@ scrotum , but they do secrete an orange substance that colors their underparts , much like the secretions of males . Hormone levels ( testosterone , androstenedione , dihydrotestosterone ) do not seem to play a part in this transient masculization , as those levels are the same in masculinized juveniles and nonmasculinized adults .

While females of other mammal species ( such as the spotted hyena ) have a pseudo @-@ penis , no other is known to diminish in size as the animal grows .",

Kerr was thus hoping to achieve both a measure of invisibility and a degree of confusion for the enemy using a rangefinder .

  "California sea lions breed gregariously between May and August , when they arrive at their breeding rookeries . When establishing a territory , the males will try to increase their chances of reproducing by staying on the rookery for as long as possible .

This is not done from the standpoint of trying to devise a new piano technique , although it actually amounts to that , but rather because this is the only practicable method of playing such large chords . It should be obvious that these chords are exact and that one practices diligently in order to play them with the desired tone quality and to have them absolutely precise in nature .",

Konnan developed an increasingly hip @-@ hop based gimmick and was nicknamed \" K @-@ Dogg . \" During his first stint in the nWo , Konnan feuded with the Luchadores whom he had brought to WCW . During this storyline , he wrestled in a Mexican Death match at Road Wild against Rey Mysterio , Jr. and a match against Juventud Guerrera at Uncensored in March 1998 . When the nWo divided into two rival factions on the May 4 , 1998 episode of Nitro , Konnan sided with the nWo Wolfpac , led by Kevin Nash . The Wolfpac feuded with nWo Hollywood , led by Hollywood Hogan and became tweeners . On the November 30 , 1998 episode of Nitro , Konnan defeated Chris Jericho for the WCW World Television Championship . His reign lasted until December 28 , 1998 , when he lost to nWo Hollywood member Scott Steiner on Nitro following interference from Buff Bagwell .

After feuding with nWo member Lex Luger , Konnan and Mysterio , Jr. were defeated by The Outsiders at SuperBrawl IX , with The Outsiders removing Mysterio 's mask in the process . Konnan later criticized WCW for not respecting Mexican wrestling culture by writing storylines that saw several Mexican wrestlers unceremoniously unmasked ( Juventud Guerrera , Psicosis , and Mysterio unmasked in WCW ) . He compared asking a luchador to remove their mask to \" going to Japan and telling the Japanese they have to eat with a fork instead of chopsticks \" .",

  "The US ran a propaganda campaign through the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) to enhance the size of the southward exodus . The program was directed by Colonel Edward Lansdale , who masqueraded as the assistant US air attaché in Saigon while leading a covert group that specialised in psychological warfare . Lansdale had advised Diem that it was imperative to maximise the population in the south in preparation for the national reunification elections . When Diem noted the limited ability of the south to absorb refugees , Lansdale assured him that the US would bear the burden . Diem thus authorised Lansdale to launch the propaganda campaign . According to the historian Seth Jacobs , the campaign \" ranked with the most audacious enterprises in the history of covert action \" . Lansdale recollected that \" U.S. officials wanted to make sure that as many persons as possible , particularly the strongly anti @-@ communist Catholics , relocated in the South \" . While many Diem supporters claimed that the mass exodus was proof of the popularity of Diem and the people 's hatred of communism , the CIA operative Chester Cooper said \" the vast movement of Catholics to South Vietnam was not spontaneous \" . However , while Lansdale is often credited by historians — usually those critical of his influence — with the large exodus of refugees due to superstition , he rejected the notion that his campaign had much effect on popular sentiment , saying in later years : \" People don ’ t just pull up their roots and transplant themselves because of slogans . They honestly feared what might happen to them , and their emotion was strong enough to overcome their attachment to their land , their homes , and their ancestral graves .

Critics proved unreceptive to Liszt 's music and Bache was advised to program less adventurous works if he wanted his career to succeed . Matters had not improved when Bache settled in London in 1865 . The War of the Romantics between musically conservative and liberal factions was in full swing and he found himself branded as \" dangerous \" for having studied with Liszt .

  "Banquo 's status as a contrast to Macbeth makes for some tense moments in the play . In act two , scene one , Banquo meets his son Fleance and asks him to take both his sword and his dagger ( \" Hold , take my sword ... Take thee that too \" ) . He also explains that he has been having trouble sleeping due to \" cursed thoughts that nature / gives way to in repose ! \" On Macbeth 's approach , he demands the sword returned to him quickly . Scholars have interpreted this to mean that Banquo has been dreaming of murdering the king as Macbeth 's accomplice in order to take the throne for his own family , as the Three Witches prophesied to him . In this reading , his good nature is so revolted by these thoughts that he gives his sword and dagger to Fleance to be sure they do not come true , but is so nervous at Macbeth 's approach that he demands them back . Other scholars have responded that Banquo 's dreams have less to do with killing the king and more to do with Macbeth . They argue that Banquo is merely setting aside his sword for the night . Then , when Macbeth approaches , Banquo , having had dreams about Macbeth 's deeds , takes back his sword as a precaution in this case .",
  "When the accreting object is a neutron star or a black hole , the gas in the inner accretion disc orbits at very high speeds because of its proximity to the compact object . The resulting friction is so significant that it heats the inner disc to temperatures at which it emits vast amounts of electromagnetic radiation ( mainly X @-@ rays ) . These bright X @-@ ray sources may be detected by telescopes . This process of accretion is one of the most efficient energy @-@ producing processes known ; up to 40 % of the rest mass of the accreted material can be emitted as radiation . ( In nuclear fusion only about 0 @.@ 7 % of the rest mass will be emitted as energy . ) In many cases , accretion discs are accompanied by relativistic jets that are emitted along the poles , which carry away much of the energy . The mechanism for the creation of these jets is currently not well understood .",

He saw a connection between the kinds of \" acts \" that people put on in their daily lives and theatrical performances . In a social interaction , as in a theatrical performance , there is an onstage area where actors ( individuals ) appear before the audience ; this is where positive self @-@ concepts and desired impressions are offered . But there is , as well , a backstage – a hidden , private area where individuals can be themselves and drop their societal roles and identities .",

  "Johnson stated that Valve 's aim was not to make Portal 2 more difficult than its predecessor , but instead to produce \" a game where you think your way through particular parts of the level , and feel really smart when you solve it . \" Portal 2 allows the player to take incremental steps to understand the game 's mechanics , an approach that led to two basic types of test chamber . The first type , which Valve calls \" checklisting \" , provides a relatively safe environment for player to experiment with a new gameplay concept ; the second type combines elements in new ways to force the player to think laterally , providing challenging and rewarding puzzles . Chambers were first developed through whiteboard via isometric drawings .

Once a consul 's term ended , he held the honorary title of consulare for the rest of his time in the senate , and had to wait for ten years before standing for reelection to the consulship. consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters , which was due , in part , to the fact that they held the highest ordinary grade of imperium ( command ) powers . While in the city of Rome , the consul was the head of the Roman government . While components of public administration were delegated to other magistrates , the management of the government was under the ultimate authority of the consul . The consuls presided over the Roman Senate and the Roman assemblies , and had the ultimate responsibility to enforce policies and laws enacted by both institutions .

The ship was allocated to Group 2 for the Norwegian portion of Operation Weserübung . The group 's task was to transport the 138th Mountain Infantry Regiment ( Gebirgsjäger @-@ Regiment 138 ) of the 3rd Mountain Division to seize Trondheim together with the heavy cruiser Admiral Hipper . The ships began loading troops on 6 April and set sail the next day . Paul Jacobi and her sisters Bruno Heinemann and Theodor Riedel each carried a company of mountain troops tasked to seize the forts defending the entrance to the Trondheimsfjord . En route the weather was so bad that Paul Jacobi rolled so far to port that water flooded the port boiler intakes , temporarily shutting down the port engine , and washing five men overboard . After passing the surprised forts the ships were able to land their troops and capture the forts with little difficulty . All of the destroyers had suffered storm damage en route and were low on fuel because none of the oil tankers had arrived yet . Admiral Hipper was ordered home on 10 April . Fuel was transferred from Paul Jacobi and Bruno Heinemann to Friedrich Eckoldt , enough to allow her to escort the cruiser home . Paul Jacobi remained in Trondheim until early May with engine troubles . Her aft torpedo tubes were removed and remounted on a pair of impounded small boats to improve the local defenses . Sometime in 1940 – 41 the ship was fitted with a FuMO 21 or FuMO 24 radar set above the bridge .",

  "The opening chorus has an unusual structure , which includes an arioso passage for the bass voice . All instruments except the trumpet play a ritornello , after which a choral fugue pictures the weeping and wailing of the text in unrelated musical material , rich in chromaticism . In great contrast the following line , \" aber die Welt wird sich freuen \" ( But the world will rejoice ) , is conveyed by the chorus embedded in a repeat of the first part of the ritornello . The sequence is repeated on a larger scale : this time the fugue renders both lines of the text as a double fugue with the second theme taken from the ritornello , then the ritornello is repeated in its entirety . The bass as the vox Christi ( voice of Christ ) sings three times , with a sudden tempo change to adagio , \" Ihr aber werdet traurig sein \" ( But you will be sad ) as an accompagnato recitative . Musicologist Julian Mincham notes : \" This recitative is a mere eight bars long but its context and piteousness give it enormous dramatic impact . Bach 's lack of respect for the conservative Leipzig authorities ' dislike of operatic styles in religious music was never more apparent ! \" Klaus Hofmann compares the recitative 's \" highly expressive melody and harmony \" to Bach 's Passions . Finally , the extended sequence of fugue and ritornello with chorus returns transposed , on the text \" Doch eure Traurigkeit soll in Freude verkehret werden \" ( Yet your sorrow shall be changed into joy ) .

She returned to the Clyde from Gibraltar on 4 June as part of Convoy MFK 15 and spent the next month docked in Glasgow undergoing repairs . Once this work was complete , California began to embark 470 personnel bound for West Africa on 4 July . She was to be accompanied on this voyage by SS Duchess of York , which had been tasked with carrying 600 Royal Air Force personnel and civilians to West Africa , but had missed an earlier convoy owing to electrical problems . Like California , Duchess of York was a pre @-@ war liner which had been converted to a troopship . Prior to the ships ' departure it was decided to use Duchess of York to transport elements of the 5th ( West Africa ) Brigade to Bombay after the ships arrived at Freetown , while California would instead carry other West African personnel to the Middle East .",
  "Operation Flavius ( also referred to as the \" Gibraltar killings \" ) was a controversial military operation in which three members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) were shot dead by the British Special Air Service ( SAS ) in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988 . The three — Seán Savage , Daniel McCann , and Mairéad Farrell — were believed to be mounting a bombing attack on British military personnel in Gibraltar . SAS soldiers challenged them in the forecourt of a petrol station , then opened fire , killing them . All three were found to be unarmed , and no bomb was discovered in Savage 's car , leading to accusations that the British government had conspired to murder them . However keys found on Farrel matched a hire car later found in Marbella ( 80km away ) which was found to contain 64 kg of Semtex and detonators . An inquest in Gibraltar ruled that the SAS had acted lawfully , while the European Court of Human Rights held that , although there had been no conspiracy , the planning and control of the operation was so flawed as to make the use of lethal force almost inevitable . The deaths were the first in a chain of violent events in a fourteen @-@ day period ; they were followed by the Milltown Cemetery attack and the corporals killings in Belfast .",

  "Other divine groups were composed of deities with interrelated roles , or who together represented a region of the Egyptian mythological cosmos . There were sets of gods for the hours of the day and night and for each nome ( province ) of Egypt . Some of these groups contain a specific , symbolically important number of deities . Paired gods can stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity . Ra , who is dynamic and light @-@ producing , and Osiris , who is static and shrouded in darkness , merge into a single god each night . Groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient Egyptian thought , and groups of four connote completeness . Rulers in the late New Kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others : Amun , Ra , and Ptah . These deities stood for the plurality of all gods , as well as for their own cult centers ( the major cities of Thebes , Heliopolis , and Memphis ) and for many threefold sets of concepts in Egyptian religious thought . Sometimes Set , the patron god of the Nineteenth Dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world , was added to this group , which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon .",
  "Brownlee advocated austerity despite surpluses . In November 1927 , at a First Ministers ' conference , he complained of increased public demand for spending in areas of provincial jurisdiction , such as education , health , and welfare . In the meantime , the federal government 's relatively reduced role in public spending allowed it the political credit that comes with running surpluses , reducing its debt , and cutting taxes . The following year he recommended that Alberta not opt @-@ in to the new federal @-@ provincial old age pension program because he felt that Alberta 's share was too onerous . The legislature accepted his recommendation for one year , to give him time to persuade the federal government to take on a greater share of the cost , but opted into the program after that even though no greater commitment from the federal government was forthcoming .",

Transformations were chosen based on how they would appear on screen due to the NES 's graphical resolution . According to Crane , objects such as the bridge and ladder were \" a must \" , but many ideas were scrapped because their nature would not be immediately obvious to the player . Puzzles that could be solved using the objects were created after the various shapes were finalized .",

The lodge became operational in April 1955 when Grant issued a manifesto announcing his discovery of an extraterrestrial \" Sirius / Set current \" upon which the lodge was to be based . In this manifesto , Grant claimed that a new energy was emanating down from Earth from another planet which he identified with Nuit , a goddess who appears in the first chapter of Crowley 's Thelemic holy text , The Book of the Law . Germer however deemed it \" blasphemy \" that Grant had identified a single planet with Nuit ; on 20 July 1955 , Germer issued a \" Note of Expulsion \" expelling Grant from the O.T.O.",

  "Glass can also be welded to metals and ceramics , although with metals the process is usually more adhesion to the surface of the metal rather than a commingling of the two materials . However , certain glasses will typically bond only to certain metals . For example , lead glass bonds readily to copper or molybdenum , but not to aluminum . Tungsten electrodes are often used in lighting but will not bond to quartz glass , so the tungsten is often wetted with molten borosilicate glass , which bonds to both tungsten and quartz . However , care must be taken to ensure that all materials have similar coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent cracking both when the object cools and when it is heated again . Special alloys are often used for this purpose , ensuring that the coefficients of expansion match , and sometimes thin , metallic coatings may be applied to a metal to create a good bond with the glass .",
  "The widespread use of ethanol brought several environmental benefits to urban centers regarding air pollution . Lead additives to gasoline were reduced through the 1980s as the amount of ethanol blended in the fuel was increased , and these additives were completely eliminated by 1991 .

After the 1932 eruption , the local vegetation was devastated , and the area remained barren until the 1990s , though human life was not impacted .

  "While living in exile in Malaysia , Ranariddh communicated to NRP party members and supporters through telephone and video conferencing . In November 2007 , he proposed a merger between the NRP , SRP and the Human Rights Party , to better their prospects against the CPP in the 2008 general elections . Rainsy , the leader of the SRP , rejected his proposal . When the election campaign began in June 2008 , Ranariddh , though not able to enter the country , raised issues such as border disputes with Cambodia 's neighbours , illegal logging , and promised to lower petrol prices . When voting took place in July , the NRP won two parliamentary seats . Immediately after the election , the NRP joined the SRP and the HRP in charging the Election Commission with irregularities . The NRP subsequently dropped their accusations , after Hun Sen brokered a secret deal with Ranariddh which allowed the latter to return from exile , in exchange for the NRP 's recognition of the election results .",
  "In July 1997 , violent clashes erupted in Phnom Penh between infantry forces separately allied to the CPP and FUNCINPEC , which effectively led to Ranariddh 's ousting after FUNCINPEC forces were defeated .

  "For translator Kathleen Ross , Facundo is \" one of the foundational works of Spanish American literary history \" . It has been enormously influential in setting out a \" blueprint for modernization \" , with its practical message enhanced by a \" tremendous beauty and passion \" . However , according to literary critic González Echevarría it is not only a powerful founding text but \" the first Latin American classic , and the most important book written about Latin America by a Latin American in any discipline or genre \" . The book 's political influence can be seen in Sarmiento ’ s eventual rise to power . He became president of Argentina in 1868 and was finally able to apply his theories to ensure that his nation achieved civilization . Although Sarmiento wrote several books , he viewed Facundo as authorizing his political views .",

  "In the final chapter on the application of the interest @-@ based rights approach , Cochrane analyses the use of animals in cultural practices , considering the importance of culture , religion and a concern about hypocrisy . Cochrane first looks at the possibility that humans have an interest in culture which outweighs certain interests of animals . He argues that it cannot be the case that culture can always outweigh other rights . He then argues the human interest culture cannot outweigh animal interests in not suffering , using jallikattu as his example , or outweigh animal interests in not being killed , even if this entails the destruction of cultures \" defined entirely by the grave harm [ they cause ] to animals \" . The human interest in freedom of religion , Cochrane claims , will usually not require the violation of animal interests , but cites Santeria as a possible exception to this . Cochrane argues against the possibility that freedom of religion is a special interest and should always merit priority , and the idea that equal opportunity should entail religious freedom to harm animals . Finally , Cochrane considers hypocrisy ; given that animals are harmed in many practices , there may be a problem in disallowing certain religious practices . However , this does not make the religious practices more permissible , and seems to presuppose that these other practices will not themselves face censure .",

  "A combination of Cao Cao 's strategic errors and the effectiveness of Huang Gai 's ruse had resulted in the allied victory at the Battle of Red Cliffs .

  "\" The Beginning \" was the first episode to be filmed in Los Angeles , California . The move was instigated by David Duchovny , who portrayed Mulder , in order to ease his opportunity to find movie work as well as to give him a chance to be nearer to his wife , Téa Leoni . Series creator Chris Carter opposed the move , but Fox network officials eventually made the decision to film in California . Indeed , the very first shot of the episode — a long look into the sun — was intended by Carter to \" boldly announce the show 's arrival in Southern California \" . As a result of the move , the episode featured a largely new group of crew members , hired by Carter , Frank Spotnitz and new co @-@ executive producer Michael Watkins . The show 's crew had to spend five weeks unpacking and cataloging material from the Vancouver film crew . Although the move was unpopular with some members of the cast and crew , both series director Kim Manners and Gillian Anderson supported the move , although less vocally than Duchovny .",

Gebhard considered his options , and listened to his advisers , chief among them his brother Karl , Truchsess von Waldburg ( 1548 – 1593 ) , and Adolf , Count von Neuenahr ( 1545 – 1589 ) . His opponents in the Cathedral Chapter enlisted external support from the Wittelsbachs in Bavaria and from the pope . Diplomats shuttled from court to court through the Rhineland , bearing pleas to Gebhard to consider the outcome of a conversion , and how it would destroy the Electorate . These diplomats assured him of support for his cause should he convert and hold the Electorate and threats to destroy him if he did convert .

His Protestant supporters told Gebhard that he could marry the woman and keep the Electorate , converting it into a dynastic duchy .

On 19 December 1582 , Gebhard announced his conversion , from , as he phrased it , the \" darkness of the papacy to the Light \" of the Word of God .",

From the dimensions of this jaw reconstruction , it was hypothesized that C. megalodon could have approached 30 metres ( 98 ft ) .

  "One of the major criticisms of the game stemmed from a disparity between the emotional thrust of the story and the actions of the player , with GameTrailers ' Justin Speer pointing out that while the story attempted to characterise Lara Croft as vulnerable and uncomfortable with killing , the player was encouraged to engage enemies aggressively and use brutal tactics to earn more experience points . Speer felt that this paradoxical approach ultimately let the game down as it undermined Lara 's character to the point where he found it difficult to identify with her at all . IGN 's Keza MacDonald also highlighted the issue , but was less critical of it than Speer , pointing out that both Lara and the player had to adapt quickly to killing in order to survive . However , Game Informer 's Matt Miller noted that the game offered the player several options for progressing through its combat situations , and that the player could avoid open conflict entirely if they chose to do so . He also praised the behaviour and presence of the enemies for the way they felt like they had actual tasks to perform on the island , rather than being clusters of polygons whose only function was to be killed by the player in order for them to progress . While on the subject of character development , GamesRadar 's Ryan Taljonick expressed that the supporting characters were underdeveloped relative to Lara Croft , describing them as \" pretty generic characters who , while rarely annoying , just aren 't memorable \" .",

  "Izuna 2 , like the original Izuna game , is a dungeon crawler . The player controls Izuna or various other characters and explores randomly generated dungeons . Each dungeon has multiple floors that need to be cleared , and many of these dungeons have bosses that must be defeated . The player manages a health bar ; if the health bar is depleted , the player dies and is forced to return to town . Dying , a common occurrence in the game , will cause the player to lose all money and items being carried , though the player will not lose experience or levels . The health bar refills continuously every turn . To prevent players from remaining in place to restore health excessively , an \" SP bar \" was added . It constantly depletes per turn and a depleted SP bar decreases the player 's attack power . The game is turn @-@ based ; the player can perform an action , such as moving , using an item , or attacking , and every other enemy in the dungeon will perform an action as well . The game includes many role @-@ playing video game elements , such as equippable items , stats , and experience points to level up .",

In the autumn of 1921 , Quisling left Norway once again , this time at the request of explorer and humanitarian Fridtjof Nansen , and in January 1922 arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kharkov to help with the League of Nations humanitarian relief effort there .

The a cappella quartet , God is a Spirit , from his cantata The Woman of Samaria , was sung to accompany the obsequies . The first concert of the Philharmonic Society 's season , on March 18 , began with a tribute to its sometime conductor : pieces from his unfinished music for Sophocles 's tragedy Ajax , and the complete The Woman of Samaria , for which the choir was provided by the RAM . These were followed by Mendelssohn 's Violin Concerto , for which the soloist was Joseph Joachim , to whom Mendelssohn had introduced Bennett at Joachim 's London debut in 1844 .

  "The geopolitical situation tilted further against Smith in December 1974 when the South African Prime Minister B J Vorster pressured him into accepting a détente initiative involving the Frontline States of Zambia , Tanzania and Botswana ( Mozambique and Angola would join the following year ) . Vorster had concluded that Rhodesia 's position was untenable and that South African interests would be better served by collaborating with black African governments over a Rhodesian settlement ; he hoped that success in this might win South Africa some international legitimacy and allow it to retain apartheid . Détente forced a ceasefire , giving the guerrillas time to regroup , and required the Rhodesians to release the ZANU and ZAPU leaders so they could attend a conference in Rhodesia , united under the UANC banner and led by Muzorewa . When Rhodesia stopped releasing black nationalist prisoners on the grounds that ZANLA and ZIPRA were not observing the ceasefire , Vorster harried Smith further by withdrawing the South African Police , which had been helping the Rhodesians patrol the countryside .

  "Although polar bears are extraordinarily powerful , its primary prey species , the ringed seal , is much smaller than itself , and many of the seals hunted are pups rather than adults . Ringed seals are born weighing 5 @.@ 4 kg ( 12 lb ) and grown to an estimated average weight of only 60 kg ( 130 lb ) . They also in places prey heavily upon the harp seal ( Pusa groenlandica ) or the harbor seal . The bearded seal , on the other hand , can be nearly the same size as the bear itself , averaging 270 kg ( 600 lb ) . Adult male bearded seals , at 350 to 500 kg ( 770 to 1 @,@ 100 lb ) are too large for a female bear to overtake , and so are potential prey only for mature male bears . Large males also occasionally attempt to hunt and kill even larger prey items . It can kill an adult walrus ( Odobenus rosmarus ) , although this is rarely attempted . At up to 2 @,@ 000 kg ( 4 @,@ 400 lb ) and a typical adult mass range of 600 to 1 @,@ 500 kg ( 1 @,@ 300 to 3 @,@ 300 lb ) , a walrus can be more than twice the bear 's weight , and has up to 1 @-@ metre ( 3 ft ) -long ivory tusks that can be used as formidable weapons . A polar bear may charge a group of walruses , with the goal of separating a young , infirm , or injured walrus from the pod .

Yet , polar bears will very seldom attack full @-@ grown adult walruses , with the largest male walrus probably invulnerable unless otherwise injured or incapacitated . Since an attack on a walrus tends to be an extremely protracted and exhausting venture , bears have been known to back down from the attack after making the initial injury to the walrus . Polar bears have also been seen to prey on beluga whales ( Delphinapterus leucas ) and narwhals ( Monodon monoceros ) , by swiping at them at breathing holes . The whales are of similar size to the walrus and nearly as difficult for the bear to subdue . Most terrestrial animals in the Arctic can outrun the polar bear on land as polar bears overheat quickly , and most marine animals the bear encounters can outswim it . In some areas , the polar bear 's diet is supplemented by walrus calves and by the carcasses of dead adult walruses or whales , whose blubber is readily devoured even when rotten . Polar bears sometimes like to go fishing where they swim underwater to catch fish like the Arctic charr or the fourhorn sculpin .",
  "Reflecting Holby City 's origins as a spin @-@ off from Casualty and the closely related premises of the two programmes , the BBC has screened occasional crossover mini @-@ dramas entitled Casualty @ Holby City , featuring a number of characters from each of the two casts .

The first full crossover was spearheaded by Casualty 's executive producer Mervyn Watson , and Holby City 's McHale .

  "A theme that pervades the opera is the treatment of love across different social ranks . In the previous Gilbert and Sullivan opera , The Sorcerer , a love potion causes trouble by inducing the villagers and wedding guests to fall in love with people of different social classes . In Pinafore , the captain 's daughter , Josephine , loves and is loved by a common sailor , but she dutifully tells him , \" your proffered love I haughtily reject \" . He expresses his devotion to her in a poetic and moving speech that ends with \" I am a British sailor , and I love you \" . It finally turns out that he is of a higher rank than she . This is a parody of the Victorian \" equality \" drama , such as Lord Lytton 's The Lady of Lyons ( 1838 ) , where the heroine rejects a virtuous peasant who makes a similarly moving speech , ending with \" I am a peasant ! \" It then turns out that he has become her social superior . Furthermore , in Pinafore , Sir Joseph assures Josephine that \" love levels all ranks \" . In Tom Taylor 's The Serf , the heroine again loves a worthy peasant who turns out to be of high rank , and she declares happily at the end that \" love levels all \" . In a satire of the libertarian traditions of nautical melodrama , Sir Joseph tells the crew of the Pinafore that they are \" any man 's equal \" ( excepting his ) , and he writes a song for them that glorifies the British sailor . Conversely , he brings the proud captain down a notch by making him \" dance a hornpipe on the cabin table \" . Jones notes that the union between Ralph and Josephine \" becomes acceptable only through the absurd second @-@ act revelation of Buttercup 's inadvertent switching of the infants \" and concludes that Gilbert is a \" conservative satirist [ who ] ultimately advocated preserving the status quo ...

  "An MA thesis by Marion Little ( 2008 ) says that the roots of the NVC model developed in the late 1960s , when Rosenberg was working on racial integration in schools and organizations in the Southern United States . The earliest version of the model ( observations , feelings , and action @-@ oriented wants ) was part of a training manual Rosenberg prepared in 1972 .

For the Second Symphony , written between 1888 and 1894 , Mahler worked simultaneously on the Wunderhorn song , Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt ( \" The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes \" ) , and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony 's third movement .
