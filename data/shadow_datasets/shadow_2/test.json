  "Black Sabbath had developed a particularly heavy sound in part due to an industrial accident guitarist Tony Iommi suffered before cofounding the band . Unable to play normally , Iommi had to tune his guitar down for easier fretting and rely on power chords with their relatively simple fingering . Deep Purple had fluctuated between styles in its early years , but by 1969 vocalist Ian Gillan and guitarist Ritchie Blackmore had led the band toward the developing heavy metal style . In 1970 , Black Sabbath and Deep Purple scored major UK chart hits with \" Paranoid \" and \" Black Night \" , respectively . That same year , two other British bands released debut albums in a heavy metal mode : Uriah Heep with Very ' Eavy ... Very ' Umble and UFO with UFO 1 . Bloodrock released their self @-@ titled debut album , containing a collection of heavy guitar riffs , gruff style vocals and sadistic and macabre lyrics .

  "Amargasaurus is classified as a member of the Dicraeosauridae , a family ranked clade within the Diplodocoidea . Currently , this clade consists of five species belonging to four genera . These are , besides Amargasaurus cazaui , the species Dicraeosaurus hansemanni and Dicraeosaurus sattleri from the Late Jurassic Tendaguru beds of Tanzania , and the recently described Brachytrachelopan mesai from the Late Jurassic of Argentina . Whitlock ( 2011 ) argued that Suuwassea emilieae from the Morrison Formation of the United States has to be placed inside the Dicraeosauridae as well , which was supported by subsequent studies . Amargasaurus is the only named dicraeosaurid from the Cretaceous ; however , an unnamed specimen from Brazil indicates that this group persisted until the end of the Early Cretaceous . Most analyses find Dicraeosaurus and Brachytrachelopan to be more closely related to each other than to Amargasaurus . Suuwassea was recovered as the most basal member of the family . A recent analysis by Tschopp et al . ( 2015 ) came to the preliminary result that two poorly known genera from the Morrison Formation , Dyslocosaurus polyonychius and Dystrophaeus viaemalae , might be additional members of the Dicraeosauridae .",

  "The Derwent Valley is considered the birthplace of the factory system . The machines developed in the Derwent Valley such as the water frame allowed continuous production . Richard Arkwright 's Cromford Mill and the associated workers ' settlement provided a template for industrial communities , not just in the valley but internationally . The reason a settlement was built contemporaneously with Cromford Mill was to provide housing for the workers ; the only way to secure the labour the mill required was if homes were provided for the labourers and their families . The success of Arkwright 's model lead to other industrialists copying him . Entrepreneurs such as Peter Nightingale , Jedediah Strutt and Thomas Evans founded the settlements of Belper , Milford , and Darley Abbey within the Derwent Valley for their employees . As well as the economic standpoint of ensuring a supply of labour , the industrialists were also concerned for their employees and families and acted out of a sense of paternalism .",
  "The reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group . This is the result of a combination of two factors : the first ionisation energies and atomisation energies of the alkali metals . Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group , it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions , thus increasing reactivity down the group . The atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element , which falls down the group as the atoms increase in radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length , making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals . Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to ( but not equal to ) the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance . This quantity decreases going down the group , and so does the activation energy ; thus , chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group .",

  "Schumacher also set the fastest time in the second qualifying session with a lap of 1 : 20 @.@ 382 , but it was not good enough to beat Hill 's fastest time overall set in the first session . Hill made a set @-@ up change that he turned out not to be happy with , but maintained his pole position , his first since the 1994 British Grand Prix . The Williams and Benetton formation continued on the second row , as Coulthard was third , with Herbert qualifying fourth after a late flying lap , equalling his best @-@ ever qualifying position , achieved at the 1994 Italian Grand Prix for the Lotus team . However , a hole was punched in the bottom of Herbert 's monocoque chassis during the session as a result of damage , leading to a night of repairs in order for him to be able to take the start in his designated race car . The work required to repair both Benetton cars caused Schumacher 's race engineer , Pat Symonds , to describe the weekend as \" one of the hardest [ ... ] I can remember for many years \" . It also meant that three British drivers started in the top four , leading Hill to joke that \" the English [ sic ] have got Michael surrounded \" . Behind the leading four , the two Ferrari cars were fifth and sixth , Berger qualifying in front of Alesi . Both were optimistic on their race prospects , despite the fact that the former suffered an engine failure during the session . The two McLaren cars of Häkkinen and Blundell were seventh and ninth , the two split by Eddie Irvine in a Jordan car . Irvine set his time despite spinning off during the session ; his teammate Barrichello suffered the season 's first engine failure during a timed session on Friday and then gearbox problems on Saturday , before also spinning off during that day 's qualifying session , restricting his to a disappointing 16th position on the grid at his home race . Katayama and Salo proved evenly @-@ matched for Tyrrell , qualifying in 11th and 12th respectively , behind Panis . The Minardi drivers were also close , with Pierluigi Martini and Luca Badoer taking 17th and 18th positions on the grid respectively , separated from the Tyrrells by Gianni Morbidelli ( Footwork ) , Frentzen , Aguri Suzuki ( Ligier ) and Barrichello . Wendlinger took 19th position , the Sauber cars handling particularly badly on the bumpy track , ahead of Bertrand Gachot and Montermini ( both Pacific drivers ) , who sandwiched Inoue in the second Footwork . At the back of the grid , the two Forti and Simtek cars covered positions 23 to 26 . Schiattarella , in a Simtek , was last out of the four positions , having caused one of the two red flags in qualifying , crashing on the exit of turn three at the beginning of the second qualifying session . The Simtek team 's testing time was limited on Friday as the mandatory onboard fire extinguishers for its cars failed to arrive in time ; a similar problem with the late arrival of parts affecting Martini 's Minardi . The times in the second session were generally quicker , with only Hill , Badoer and Wendlinger setting their quickest lap times during the first session .",

American curator Edward Robinson notes the influence of the Ionic schools on this and other artwork from ancient Aeolia , now known as Thessaly : \" It is now a question whether these works were done by local artists under this influence , or by Ionic artists who may have established themselves in Thessaly , as they did in other parts of Greece . \" The Ionian style 's influence also may be seen in the depiction of the hair @-@ net worn by the women in the relief .",

  "In 1798 , the federal government , under President John Adams , passed the Alien and Sedition Acts , which deemed \" any false , scandalous and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States \" a criminal act . The Alien and Sedition Acts were used for political impact against members of the Republican Party in order to punish them for criticizing the government .

After taking office in 1801 , Jefferson issued pardons to those convicted under the Alien and Sedition Acts .

  "The voters of Henderson County chose Dixon to represent them at the state constitutional convention of 1849 . The Whigs nominated him to chair the convention , but he lost to the Democratic nominee James Guthrie by a vote of 50 to 43 . A large slaveholder , Dixon introduced numerous measures to protect the rights of slaveholders in the new constitution . Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property , that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction , and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic . Though some of these ideas were challenged , all eventually found their way into the Kentucky Constitution of 1850 .",

  "Many mammalian serpins have been identified that share no obvious orthology with a human serpin counterpart . Examples include numerous rodent serpins ( particularly some of the murine intracellular serpins ) as well as the uterine serpins .

  "To deter Japanese aggression in the Far East in late 1941 , Winston Churchill was determined to send a small group of fast capital ships , along with one modern aircraft carrier to Singapore . Repulse was already in the Indian Ocean and was ordered to Colombo in November to rendezvous with the battleship Prince of Wales where they would form Force Z. The carrier Indomitable was supposed to join them , but she was delayed when she ran aground while working up in the Caribbean . The two ships , and their escorting destroyers , arrived in Singapore on 2 December . Force Z departed on the evening of 8 December in an attempt to destroy Japanese troop convoys and protect the army 's seaward flanks from any Japanese landings in their rear . They were spotted by a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft during the following afternoon and shadowed for the rest of the day . Admiral Sir Tom Phillips decided to cancel the operation as the Japanese were now alerted . Force Z turned back during the evening , but was spotted again early on the morning of 10 December . About four hours later Japanese bombers arrived and attacked Repulse from high altitude ; she was slightly damaged by one bomb hit in her port hangar . The second wave consisted of torpedo bombers which missed Repulse , but scored at least one hit on Prince of Wales . The third wave again consisted of high @-@ altitude level bombers that missed Repulse entirely . The fourth wave of torpedo bombers managed to hit Repulse once amidships on her port side . The final wave of torpedo bombers hit Repulse with three more torpedoes and the ship capsized with the loss of 508 officers and men . The sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse contributed to the rapid fall of Singapore and Malaya to the Japanese , and demonstrated the dominance of air power over the capital ships that had been the backbone of naval power since the 1600s .",

  "Lead from the atmosphere or soil can end up in groundwater and surface water . It is also potentially in drinking water , e.g. from plumbing and fixtures that are either made of lead or have lead solder . Since acidic water breaks down lead in plumbing more readily , chemicals can be added to municipal water to increase the pH and thus reduce the corrosivity of the public water supply . Chloramines , which were adopted as a substitute for chlorine disinfectants due to fewer health concerns , increase corrositivity . In the US , 14 – 20 % of total lead exposure is attributed to drinking water . In 2004 , a team of seven reporters from The Washington Post discovered high levels of lead in the drinking water in Washington , D.C. and won an award for investigative reporting for a series of articles about this contamination . In the Flint water crisis , a switch to a more corrosive municipal water source elevated lead levels in drinking water in domestic tap water .",

  "In November 1994 , the Siege of Bihać , a battle of the Bosnian War , entered a critical stage as the VRS and the ARSK came close to capturing the town of Bihać from the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( ARBiH ) . It was a strategic area and , since June 1993 , Bihać had been one of six United Nations Safe Areas established in Bosnia and Herzegovina . The US administration felt that its capture by Serb forces would intensify the war and lead to a humanitarian disaster greater than any other in the conflict to that point . Amongst the United States , France and the United Kingdom , division existed regarding how to protect the area . The US called for airstrikes against the VRS , but the French and the British opposed them citing safety concerns and a desire to maintain the neutrality of French and British troops deployed as a part of the UNPROFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina . In turn , the US was unwilling to commit ground troops . On the other hand , the Europeans recognized that the US was free to propose military confrontation with the Serbs while relying on the European powers to block any such move , since French President François Mitterrand discouraged any military intervention , greatly aiding the Serb war effort . The French stance reversed after Jacques Chirac was elected president of France in May 1995 , pressuring the British to adopt a more aggressive approach as well . Denying Bihać to the Serbs was also strategically important to Croatia , and General Janko Bobetko , the Chief of the Croatian General Staff , considered the potential fall of Bihać to represent an end to Croatia 's war effort .",

  "Although there is no extant music that can be positively identified with Nero , there is a possibility that some of it may have been used in later works . John E. Sawyer , in his analysis of Agrippina , reveals that this work , composed five years after Nero with similar characters , \" contains the highest proportion of borrowed material of any of the composer 's major dramatic works \" , and Dean and Knapp speculate as to whether it also incorporates borrowings from Nero . According to the Handel scholar Charles Cudworth , the suite of dances that follows the overture to Handel 's 1707 opera Rodrigo ( his first after leaving Hamburg ) , could very well have begun as ballet music in Nero or another of the lost Hamburg operas . The musicologist Bernd Baselt has raised the possibility that Handel 's Harpsichord Suite in G Minor , HWV 453 , is an arrangement of the overture to Nero . A version of this suite , reconstructed for orchestra by Peter Holman , is included in a selection of Handel 's Hamburg music , issued by Hyperion Records in January 2012 .",

  "In many romance languages , the literal translation of the local term for \" midshipman \" into English is \" Navy Guard \" , including the French garde @-@ marine , Spanish guardia marina , Portuguese guarda @-@ marinha , and Italian guardiamarina . These ranks all refer to young naval officer cadets , but the selection , training and responsibilities of each diverge from the British tradition . The French rank of garde de la marine was established in 1670 , when an office of the monarchy selected young gentlemen from the nobility to serve the King in the Gardes de la Marine . The concept of the Gardes was borrowed from the various guards units within the Maison militaire du roi de France . In 1686 these guards were organized into companies of cadets at the ports of Brest , Rochefort and Toulon . Unlike midshipmen in the Royal Navy , the Gardes trained mostly on shore and focused on military drill and theory rather than practical skills in gunnery , navigation and seamanship . After the succession of the Bourbon Philip V of Spain to the Spanish throne , the French system of naval officer education spread to Spain .

A strong contingent of women from America joined international women 's groups to change the existing nationality laws , but the women were unable to agree on wording .

In response , Macmillan organised an International Committee for Action on the Nationality of Married Women early the next year . Six of the most influential international women 's groups sought a broad base of support from working women .

The new committee was successful in lobbying the League of Nations to address the problem , but when the League constituted a study group , that group was split between two intractable factions . On one side were those who wanted a married couple to have exactly one nationality , based on that of the husband , and on the other side were those like Macmillan who favoured independent citizenship between spouses , with the possibility of wives having different citizenship than their husbands , and children to be allowed dual citizenship . In 1932 , the women 's group , at an impasse , were pushed aside as ineffectual by the League of Nations , who decided in favour of ratifying the Hague Convention .

They exit the water , climb the beach , and scrape away the surface sand to form a body pit . With their hind limbs , they excavate an egg chamber in which the eggs are deposited . The females then cover the egg chamber and body pit with sand , and finally return to the sea . This process takes one to two hours , and occurs in open sand areas or on top of sand dunes , preferably near dune grasses that the females can use to camouflage the nest . The nesting area must be selected carefully because it affects characteristics such as fitness , emergence ratio , and vulnerability to nest predators . Loggerheads have an average clutch size of 112 @.@ 4 eggs .",

  "Cordyline australis is one of the few New Zealand forest trees that can recover from fire . It can renew its trunk from buds on the protected rhizomes under the ground . This gives the tree an advantage because it can regenerate itself quickly and the fire has eliminated competing plants . Cabbage tree leaves contain oils which make them burn readily . The same oils may also slow down the decay of fallen leaves , so that they build up a dense mat that prevents the seeds of other plants from germinating . When the leaves do break down , they form a fertile soil around the tree . Cabbage tree seed also has a store of oil , which means it remains viable for several years . When a bushfire has cleared the land of vegetation , cabbage tree seeds germinate in great numbers to make the most of the light and space opened up by the flames .",
  "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari was written by Hans Janowitz and Carl Mayer , both of whom were pacifists by the time they met following World War I. Janowitz served as an officer during the war , but the experience left him embittered with the military , which affected his writing . Mayer feigned madness to avoid military service during the war , which led him to intense examinations from a military psychiatrist . The experience left him distrustful of authority , and the psychiatrist served as a model for the Dr. Caligari character . Janowitz and Mayer were introduced in June 1918 by a mutual friend , actor Ernst Deutsch . Both writers were penniless at the time . Gilda Langer , an actress with whom Mayer was in love , encouraged Janowitz and Mayer to write a film together . She later became the basis for the Jane character . Langer also encouraged Janowitz to visit a fortune teller , who predicted that Janowitz would survive his military service during the war , but Langer would die . This prediction proved true , as Langer died unexpectedly in 1920 , and Janowitz said it inspired the scene in which Cesare predicts Alan 's death at the fair .",

  "Captain James Horsburgh , a Scottish hydrographer to the British East India Company who had prepared many charts and sailing instructions for the East Indies , China , New Holland , the Cape of Good Hope and other intermediate ports , died in May 1836 .

The next few years saw a struggle for control of the theatre , and Taylor bought Sheridan 's interest in 1781 .

  "Required to tender by the end of April 1947 , work began on receipt of Specification B.35 / 46 at Avro , led by technical director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies ; the type designation was Avro 698 . It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the Specification ; knowing little about high @-@ speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US , they investigated German Second World War swept wing research . The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft , with a swept wing of 45 ° , would have doubled the weight requirement . Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability , the team deleted the tail ( empennage ) and the supporting fuselage , it thus became a swept @-@ back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin ( vertical stabilizer ) at each wingtip . The estimated weight was now only 50 % over the requirement ; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips , which enabled the specification to be met . Though Dr Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing , Chadwick ’ s team had followed its own logical design process . The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline . Outboard of the engines were two bomb @-@ bays .",

  "A black hole is a region of spacetime exhibiting such strong gravitational effects that nothing — including particles and electromagnetic radiation such as light — can escape from inside it . The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole . The boundary of the region from which no escape is possible is called the event horizon . Although crossing the event horizon has enormous effect on the fate of the object crossing it , it appears to have no locally detectable features . In many ways a black hole acts like an ideal black body , as it reflects no light . Moreover , quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation , with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass . This temperature is on the order of billionths of a kelvin for black holes of stellar mass , making it essentially impossible to observe .",

  "The successive Anglo @-@ Canadian offensives around Caen kept the best of the German forces in Normandy , including most of the available armor , to the eastern end of the Allied lodgement , but even so First US Army made slow progress against dogged German resistance .

  "NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization 's member states , and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US supreme commanders .

Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed , along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion — doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO 's military structure in 1966 for 30 years . After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 , the organization was drawn into the breakup of Yugoslavia , and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999 .

  "Elephants were historically kept for display in the menageries of Ancient Egypt , China , Greece and Rome . The Romans in particular pitted them against humans and other animals in gladiator events . In the modern era , elephants have traditionally been a major part of zoos and circuses around the world . In circuses , they are trained to perform tricks . The most famous circus elephant was probably Jumbo ( 1861 – 15 September 1885 ) , who was a major attraction in the Barnum & Bailey Circus . These animals do not reproduce well in captivity , due to the difficulty of handling musth bulls and limited understanding of female oestrous cycles . Asian elephants were always more common than their African counterparts in modern zoos and circuses . After CITES listed the Asian elephant under Appendix I in 1975 , the number of African elephants in zoos increased in the 1980s , although the import of Asians continued . Subsequently , the US received many of its captive African elephants from Zimbabwe , which had an overabundance of the animals .

  "A common objection to evolution is that it is simply too unlikely for life , in its complexity and apparent \" design , \" to have arisen \" by chance . \" It is argued that the odds of life having arisen without a deliberate intelligence guiding it are so astronomically low that it is unreasonable not to infer an intelligent designer from the natural world , and specifically from the diversity of life . A more extreme version of this argument is that evolution cannot create complex structures ( see the Creation of complex structures section below ) . The idea that it is simply too implausible for life to have evolved is often wrongly encapsulated with a quotation that the \" probability of life originating on Earth is no greater than the chance that a hurricane , sweeping through a scrapyard , would have the luck to assemble a Boeing 747 \" — a claim attributed to astrophysicist Fred Hoyle and known as Hoyle 's fallacy .

The list of legal coins duplicated that of the previous coinage act , leaving off only the silver dollar and three smaller coins .

Among Mesoamerican peoples the capture of prisoners was a priority , while to the Spanish such taking of prisoners was a hindrance to outright victory . The inhabitants of Guatemala , for all their sophistication , lacked key elements of Old World technology , such as the use of iron and steel and functional wheels . The use of steel swords was perhaps the greatest technological advantage held by the Spanish , although the deployment of cavalry helped them to rout indigenous armies on occasion . The Spanish were sufficiently impressed by the quilted cotton armour of their Maya enemies that they adopted it in preference to their own steel armour . The conquistadors applied a more effective military organisation and strategic awareness than their opponents , allowing them to deploy troops and supplies in a way that increased the Spanish advantage .",

  "Unlike the earlier Neolithic and Bronze Ages , which have provided massive monuments to the dead , Iron Age burial sites in Scotland are rare , and a recent find at Dunbar may provide further insight into the culture of this period . A similar site of a warrior 's grave at Alloa has been provisionally dated to AD 90 – 130 . A traveller called Demetrius of Tarsus related to Plutarch the tale of an expedition to the west coast in or shortly before AD 83 . He stated that it was \" a gloomy journey amongst uninhabited islands \" but that he had visited one which was the retreat of holy men . He mentioned neither the druids nor the name of the island .",

  "The casket letters did not appear publicly until the Conference of 1568 , although the Scottish privy council had seen them by December 1567 . Mary had been forced to abdicate and held captive for the best part of a year in Scotland . The letters were never made public to support her imprisonment and forced abdication . Historian Jenny Wormald believes this reluctance on the part of the Scots to produce the letters , and their destruction in 1584 , whatever their content , constitute proof that they contained real evidence against Mary , whereas Weir thinks it demonstrates the lords required time to fabricate them . At least some of Mary 's contemporaries who saw the letters had no doubt that they were genuine . Among them was the Duke of Norfolk , who secretly conspired to marry Mary in the course of the commission , although he denied it when Elizabeth alluded to his marriage plans , saying \" he meant never to marry with a person , where he could not be sure of his pillow \" .",

  "Henry tried to maintain a sophisticated household that combined hunting and drinking with cosmopolitan literary discussion and courtly values . Nonetheless , Henry 's passion was for hunting , for which the court became famous . Henry had a number of preferred royal hunting lodges and apartments across his lands , and invested heavily in his royal castles , both for their practical utility as fortresses , and as symbols of royal power and prestige . The court was relatively formal in its style and language , possibly because Henry was attempting to compensate for his own sudden rise to power and relatively humble origins as the son of a count .

Finally , sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulphide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms , which in turn , support other organisms such as mussels , clams , limpets , and sea snails . This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species , averaging 185 species per site .",

  "There are various societal pressures that combine to create the double burden , including some economic thinking of domestic work , thoughts about net household gain , and the perceived notion that women are more likely to ask for maternity leave than men . Many classical economists believe that child care does not contribute to economic growth of the nation . They believe that welfare states such as Sweden are subsidizing work that is unproductive , and often think of children like a pet that only consumes without growing up to be productive workers . There is also the notion that the net household gain of a woman taking an hour away from her unpaid labor in order to do paid labor is always more than the net household gain of a man taking an hour away from paid labor to do unpaid labor . This creates the thought that women should do paid work and lose some time doing domestic jobs without the man taking time away from paid work to do domestic jobs , creating a deficit of hours necessary to do unpaid work that need to get filled . In addition , women are seen as more likely to ask for maternity leave than men , meaning that it is more difficult for them to obtain a well paying job , which has negative effects on female employment .",

This , as well as the departure of O 'Leary and the shortage of transfer funds at Villa , meant that a deal to sign Milner permanently seemed unlikely . In June , it became even less likely when Villa rejected an offer of Milner as part of a trade for Gareth Barry . However , the deal was resurrected when Villa were taken over by American billionaire Randy Lerner , and Martin O 'Neill was appointed as new Villa manager . Villa made an improved offer on 30 August , which was accepted by Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd . Media sources quoted the transfer fee as being £ 4 million .

At a series of meetings between 9 and 11 May 1945 , Van Acker insisted that the King publicly announce his support for the Allied cause and his commitment to parliamentary democracy . No agreement was reached . In the meantime , Leopold took up residence in Pregny ( near Geneva ) in Switzerland under the pretext that heart palpitations made further negotiations or thoughts of return to political life impossible .",

  "The sound of the guns at Assaye was heard by Stevenson who immediately broke up his camp 10 miles ( 16 km ) miles to the west in an attempt to join the battle . However , he was misled by his guide and marched first on Borkardan before he reached the battlefield on the evening of 24 September . Suspecting that his guide had intentionally led him astray , Stevenson later had him hanged . He remained with Wellesley to assist with the wounded – troops were still being carried from the battlefield four days after the engagement – until ordered to recommence the pursuit of the Maratha army on 26 September . Wellesley remained to the south while he established a hospital at Ajanta and awaited reinforcements from Poona . Two months later , he combined with Stevenson to rout Scindia and Berar 's demoralised and weakened army at Argaon , and shortly afterwards stormed Berar 's fortress at Gawilghur . These victories , coupled with Lieutenant General Lake 's successful campaign in the north , induced the two Maratha chiefs to sue for peace .",

  "Temple , like most members of his family , was a puritan and supported Parliament against the King . His uncle Lord Saye and Sele was one of the King 's principal opponents . Temple 's military experience became useful when the First English Civil War broke out in August , 1642 . He was appointed captain of a troop of horse raised by Lord Saye and Sele and commanded by Temple 's cousin , John Fiennes .

  "There is no requirement of subsidiarity : in this respect \" necessary self defense \" differs from \" utmost necessity \" . The main limitation is that the defense may not be manifestly disproportionate to the manner of the attack . The manner of the attack is not the same as its intensity , which is only a part of it . For example , \" intensity \" covers whether the attack is committed by a single attacker or a group , with or without a gun , and the relative strength of the attacker and the party attacked , etc . But the manner also includes future imminent dangers , such as the possibility that single attacker might imminently be joined by others .",
  "Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are sometimes used to determine the temperature at which the bone was deposited , as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature . In one specimen , the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5 ° C ( 7 to 9 ° F ) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg . This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature ( homeothermy ) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals . Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past , and may have been altered during or after fossilization ( diagenesis ) . Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers , finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time ( Giganotosaurus ) . Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy , while varanid lizards from the same formation did not . Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy , it does not necessarily mean that it was endothermic . Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy , as in some living sea turtles .",

An example of the impact of the Westerlies is when dust plumes , originating in the Gobi desert combine with pollutants and spread large distances downwind , or eastward , into North America . The Westerlies can be particularly strong , especially in the Southern Hemisphere , where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the progression of west to east winds to slow down .

Napoleon had ordered the emancipation of Jews throughout territories under French hegemony . Like their French counterparts , wealthy German Jews sponsored salons ; in particular , several Jewish salonnières held important gatherings in Frankfurt and Berlin during which German intellectuals developed their own form of republican intellectualism . Throughout the subsequent decades , beginning almost immediately after the defeat of the French , reaction against the mixing of Jews and Christians limited the intellectual impact of these salons . Beyond the salons , Jews continued a process of Germanization in which they intentionally adopted German modes of dress and speech , working to insert themselves into the emerging 19th @-@ century German public sphere .

  "When any aircraft passes the critical mach of that particular airframe , the centre of pressure shifts rearwards .

This could have been countered by the use of trim controls , but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag . Instead , the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of mass , effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control .",

Few offenders were prosecuted , mainly some poor trappers , but the large enterprises were not affected . In 1857 , a bill was brought forth to the Ohio State Legislature seeking protection for the passenger pigeon , yet a Select Committee of the Senate filed a report stating that the bird did not need protection , being \" wonderfully prolific \" , and dismissing the suggestion that the species could be destroyed .

There was purportedly even an infant grandson of Penda named Rumwold who lived a saintly three @-@ day life of fervent preaching . What is known about Penda is primarily derived from the history written by the Northumbrian Bede , a priest not inclined to objectively portray a pagan Mercian who engaged in fierce conflict with Christian kings , and in particular with Northumbrian rulers . Indeed , Penda has been described as \" the villain of Bede 's third book \" ( of the Historia Ecclesiastica ) . From the perspective of the Christians who later wrote about Penda , the important theme that dominates their descriptions is the religious context of his wars — for instance , the Historia Brittonum says that Penda prevailed at Maserfield through \" diabolical agency \" — but Penda 's greatest importance was perhaps in his opposition to the supremacy of the Northumbrians . According to Stenton , had it not been for Penda 's resistance , \" a loosely compacted kingdom of England under Northumbrian rule would probably have been established by the middle of the seventh century . \" In summarising Penda , he wrote the following :",

  "Prionomyrmecini was originally described in 1915 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler in his journal article \" The ants of the Baltic amber \" , who originally placed it in the subfamily Ponerinae . In the same journal , Wheeler assigned Prionomyrmex as the sole member of the tribe . In 1954 , William Brown Jr. moved the tribe to Myrmeciinae , noting similar morphological characteristics of Prionomyrmex and other genera such as Myrmecia and Nothomyrmecia . In 2000 , Cesare Baroni Urbani described a new fossil species from Baltic amber , which he named Prionomyrmex janzeni . After examining specimens of his newly described species and Nothomyrmecia , Baroni Urbani noted that Prionomyrmex is a paraphyletic relative to Nothomyrmecia , and the two genera were so morphologically similar that Nothomyrmecia must be synonymised . Due to this , Baroni Urbani separated Prionomyrmex from Myrmeciinae and synonymised Nothomyrmecia , renaming Nothomyrmecia macrops as Prionomyrmex macrops . The tribe itself was later treated as a subfamily , known as Prionomyrmeciinae . In 2003 , Dlussky & Perfilieva separated Nothomyrmecia from Prionomyrmex and both genera were moved to the subfamily Myrmeciinae , and Prionomyrmecini was treated as a tribe . In 2005 and 2008 , Baroni Urbani provided additional evidence in favour of his proposed classification , but such proposal has been rejected by the entomological community . Nothomyrmecia macrops and the extinct Prionomyrmex are the only accepted members of the tribe .",

  "In revisiting the film in the 1970s , Arthur Schlesinger noted that Hollywood films generally age well , revealing an unexpected depth or integrity , but in the case of Gone with the Wind time has not treated it kindly . Richard Schickel posits that one measure of a film 's quality is to ask what you can remember of it , and the film falls down in this regard : unforgettable imagery and dialogue are simply not present . Stanley Kauffmann , likewise , also found the film to be a largely forgettable experience , claiming he could only remember two scenes vividly . Both Schickel and Schlesinger put this down to it being \" badly written \" , in turn describing the dialogue as \" flowery \" and possessing a \" picture postcard \" sensibility . Schickel also believes the film fails as popular art , in that it has limited rewatch value — a sentiment that Kauffmann also concurs with , stating that having watched it twice he hopes \" never to see it again : twice is twice as much as any lifetime needs \" . Both Schickel and Andrew Sarris identify the film 's main failing is in possessing a producer 's sensibility rather than an artistic one : having gone through so many directors and writers the film does not carry a sense of being \" created \" or \" directed \" , but rather having emerged \" steaming from the crowded kitchen \" , where the main creative force was a producer 's obsession in making the film as literally faithful to the novel as possible .",

As the death of the Tsar had never been proved , the estate could only be released to relatives ten years after the supposed date of his death . Fallows set up a company , called the Grandanor Corporation ( an acronym of Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia ) , which sought to raise funds by selling shares in any prospective estate .

When it was founded in October 1951 , Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates ; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech , and what , if any , role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace . Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech . However , Rosselot 's participation in Scientific Associates ' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech 's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center .",

The appointment aroused some controversy as McKenna 's critics in the Senate said he was too closely associated with railroad interests and lacked the qualifications of a Supreme Court justice . Despite the objections , McKenna 's nomination was approved unanimously . McKenna responded to the criticism of his legal education by taking some courses at Columbia Law School for several months before taking his seat .

  "The remains of a lizard in the German specimen 's thoracic cavity show that Compsognathus preyed on small vertebrates . Marsh , who examined the specimen in 1881 , thought that this small skeleton in the Compsognathus belly was an embryo , but in 1903 , Franz Nopcsa concluded that it was a lizard . Ostrom identified the remains as belonging to a lizard of the genus Bavarisaurus , which he concluded was a fast and agile runner owing to its long tail and limb proportions . This in turn led to the conclusion that its predators , Compsognathus , must have had sharp vision and the ability to rapidly accelerate and outrun the lizard . The Bavarisaurus is in a single piece , indicating that the Compsognathus must have swallowed its prey whole . The French specimen 's gastric contents consist of unidentified lizards or sphenodontids .",

  "Operation Desert Storm began on 17 January 1991 , but for the first two weeks 3rd Battalion only conducted sporadic engagements with its Iraqi counterparts across the border . That all changed on 29 January , when several Iraqi divisions unexpectedly crossed the border and seized the Saudi town of Khafji , less than 15 kilometers north of 3rd Battalion 's position . During the attack the Executive Officer along with the Battalion Sergeant Major drove into the town on a rescue mission looking for two Army soldiers who had been captured . Although they were unable to find them , the Marines from 3rd Battalion did encounter an Iraqi patrol and exchanged rounds with them before escaping . While Saudi and Qatari units ultimately retook the town , 3rd Battalion played a vital role in both coordinating the attack and blocking further Iraqi advances southward . In addition , several heavy machine guns and forward air controllers from the battalion were shifted over to the Saudis and took place in the assault . From 19 – 21 February , 3rd Battalion moved from Al Mish 'ab to the forward assembly areas that it would be using to launch its attack into Kuwait . It was also during this period that 3rd Battalion was given its assignment for the ground offensive . Lacking heavy armor or motorized transport , the battalion ( along with 2 / 3 ) would infiltrate Iraqi positions along the Saudi border and provide flank security for the rest of the 1st Marine Division to make its assault into Kuwait . On the night of 22 February , 3rd Battalion crossed the border into Kuwait , infiltrating past Iraqi minefields , tank traps , and other obstacles . Like many American units , 3rd Battalion encountered no Iraqi resistance and the biggest threat to the Marines came from friendly fire . Throughout the ground war , the battalion advanced steadily northwards , encountering no resistance but taking plenty of prisoners . 3rd Battalion arrived outside the Kuwait International Airport around 27 February where a SCUD missile landed near the battalion 's command post . Several months later , 3rd Battalion returned to Hawaii , having suffered no combat casualties .",

  "In 1960 , promoter Allan Williams arranged for the band , now calling themselves the Beatles , to play at the Kaiserkeller club in Hamburg owned by Bruno Koschmider . The impromptu musical education Harrison received while playing long hours with the Beatles , as well as the guitar lessons he took from Tony Sheridan while they briefly served as his backing group , laid the foundations of his sound and of his quiet , professional role within the group ; he was later known as \" the quiet Beatle \" .

  "The Brandenburg @-@ class ships were the foundation of what eventually became the High Seas Fleet . As they represented a shift in the strategic outlook of the German navy , the traditional method of ship construction , which relied heavily on foreign models , was abandoned . Some experimentation was implemented in the design process , particularly in the armor types that were installed on the ships . Brandenburg and Wörth were equipped with compound armor that consisted of several layers of different materials , while the latter two ships received Harvey nickel @-@ steel alloy armor plating . The addition of a third main battery turret was also a significant innovation . While a novel concept , the midships turret caused prohibitive blast damage to the surrounding superstructure when fired , which led to the idea being abandoned . This arrangement has led some authors to characterize the ships as proto @-@ dreadnoughts . This is incorrect , as the guns were not the same caliber , and the ships were designed to fight at close range , unlike the later dreadnought battleships .",
  "Contemporary Hittite texts indicate the presence of Ahhiyawa , which strengthened its position in western Anatolia from c . 1400 to c . 1220 BC . Ahhiyawa is generally accepted as a Hittite translation of Mycenaean Greece ( Achaeans in Homeric Greek ) . During this period , the kings of Ahhiyawa were clearly able to deal with the Hittite kings both in a military and diplomatic way . Ahhiyawa activity was to interfere in Anatolian affairs , with the support of anti @-@ Hittite uprisings or through local vassal rulers , which the king of the Ahhiyawa used as agents for the extension of his influence . In one occasion , in c . 1400 BC , Attarsiya ( a possible Hittite translation of Atreus ) launched a campaign deploying an army headed by war chariots and attacked regions which were under Hittite influence . Later , Attarsiya , invaded the island of Alashiya ( Cyprus ) together with a number of his Anatolian allies . The invading force finally succeeded in controlling the island and overthrowing the local Hittite authorities . The campaigns of Attarsiya represent the earliest recorded Mycenaean Greek military activity against the Hittites . The Hittite @-@ Ahhiyawan confrontation in Wilusa , the Hittite name for Troy , in the 13th century BC may have provided the historical foundation for the Trojan War tradition .",

  "The first prototype was converted from a Hamilcar Mark I. Two Bristol Mercury radial piston engines , capable of producing 965 hp , were added to the wings of the glider , and the wings and fuselage were strengthened so they could take the weight of the engines . Extra controls were added to the cockpit and duplicated in the two pilot positions , although space restrictions meant that the glider could only be started from the rear seat , and fuel tanks were added to the wings , with the possibility of a third being carried in the fuselage . These additions increased the glider 's weight to 47 @,@ 000 pounds ( 21 @,@ 000 kg ) , but its other dimensions remained unchanged , including the carrying capacity in the fuselage . The first flight of the Mark X , under its own power , took place in February 1945 and the initial flight and further trials showed that the glider operated as had been expected . With engines installed , a Mark X could be towed by a fully loaded Halifax and achieve an operational radius of approximately 900 miles ( 1 @,@ 400 km ) . However , if the glider itself was fully loaded and took off on its own power , it was discovered that it could not maintain height even at full power ; this resulted in a decision to decrease the amount of cargo it could carry under its own power , which in turn decreased its weight to 32 @,@ 500 pounds ( 14 @,@ 700 kg ) . Two Hamilcar Mark Is were converted for initial trials , and when these proved satisfactory a further eight Mark Is were converted and ten Mark Xs built from scratch ; any further orders were cancelled when the conflict ended in August 1945 , although further tests were conducted in the United States . One other Hamilcar variant was proposed , although it never went into production or appeared to go further than the design stage . This was a proposal to mate a Lockheed P @-@ 38 Lightning fighter to the top of a Hamilcar , as the fighter would provide enough power to keep both aircraft in flight and relieve the glider pilots of the task of controlling the glider until it cast off to land .",

  "Tidal effects are the result of forces acting on a body differing from one part of the body to another . For example , the gravitational effect of a star varies with distance from one side of a planet to another . Also heat from a star creates a temperature gradient between the day and nightsides which is another source of tides . For example , on Earth , air pressure variations on the ground are affected more by temperature differences than gravitational ones .",

  "Like most RPGs , the Final Fantasy installments use an experience level system for character advancement , in which experience points are accumulated by killing enemies . Character classes , specific jobs that enable unique abilities for characters , are another recurring theme . Introduced in the first game , character classes have been used differently in each title . Some restrict a character to a single job to integrate it into the story , while other games feature dynamic job systems that allow the player to choose from multiple classes and switch throughout the game . Though used heavily in many games , such systems have become less prevalent in favor of characters that are more versatile ; characters still match an archetype , but are able to learn skills outside their class .",

  "Several taxa have been named as belonging to the genus Sarcosphaera over the years , but most lack modern descriptions and have not been reported since their original collections . For example , Sarcosphaera funerata was renamed by Fred Jay Seaver in 1930 based on the basionym Peziza funerata , originally described by Cooke in 1878 . Sarcosphaera gigantea was a species collected from Michigan , originally described as Pustularia gigantea by Heinrich Rehm in 1905 , and considered distinct from S. coronaria on the basis of its smaller spore size . Sarcosphaera ulbrichiana was described by Wilhem Kirschstein in 1943 . Other taxa have been reduced to synonymy with S. coronaria , or transferred to other genera . Sarcosphaera eximia ( originally Peziza eximia Durieu & Lév . 1848 , and later transferred to Sarcosphaera by René Maire ) , Sarcosphaera crassa ( considered by Zdeněk Pouzar in a 1972 publication to be the correct name for S. coronaria ) and Sarcosphaera dargelasii ( originally Peziza dargelasii Gachet 1829 , transferred to Sarcosphaera by Nannfeldt ) are now considered synonyms of S. coronaria . Sarcosphaera ammophila ( originally Peziza ammophila Durieu & Mont . ) and Sarcosphaera amplissima ( originally Peziza amplissima Fr . 1849 ) have since been transferred back to Peziza . The 10th edition of the Dictionary of the Fungi ( 2008 ) considers Sarcosphaera to be monotypic , and Index Fungorum has only Sarcosphaera coronaria confirmed as valid .",
  "The second Galaxy Game prototype remained on display in the Tresidder building until May 1979 , when it was removed due to the display processor becoming unreliable . Throughout its time on display , it remained popular , with \" ten to twenty people gathered around the machines most Friday and Saturday nights when school was in session . \" Pitts later claimed that by the time the machine was removed , it had managed to make back the original investment . After its removal , the machine was dismantled , with the computer parts stored in an office and the casing outdoors . The unit was restored in 1997 with a recreated display processor and put on display for several years in the computer science department at Stanford with two consoles attached for free use by students . Due to issues with space and maintenance , in 2000 it was moved into the Computer History Museum in Mountain View , California , in the displayed storage section . In August 2010 , the museum loaned the console to Google to be placed at their headquarters campus at the request of Pitts — who wanted the game to be played as well as displayed — due to a discussion with senior vice president Jonathan Rosenberg , who had been hired as a 13 year old by Tuck and Pitts in the mid @-@ 1970s to keep the machine cleaned .

  "The nine remaining gliders transporting the airborne troops assigned to Group Granite successfully landed on the roof of Fort Eben @-@ Emael , utilizing arrester @-@ parachutes to slow their descent and rapidly bring them to a halt . The airborne troops rapidly emerged from the gliders and began attaching explosive charges to those emplacements on the top of the Fort which housed the artillery pieces that could target the three captured bridges . In the southern part of the Fort , Objective No. 18 , an artillery observation casemate housing three 75mm artillery pieces was damaged with a light demolition charge and then permanently destroyed with a heavier charge , which collapsed the casemate 's observation dome and part of the roof of the Fort itself . Objective No. 12 , a traversing turret holding two more artillery pieces was also destroyed by airborne troops , who then moved to Objective No. 26 , a turret holding another three 75mm weapons ; although explosives were detonated against this and the airborne troops assigned to destroy it moved off , this proved to be premature as one of the guns was rapidly brought to bear against the attackers , who were forced to assault it for a second time to destroy it . Another pair of 75mm guns in a cupola were disabled , as was a barracks known to house Belgian troops . However , attempts to destroy Objective No. 24 proved to be less successful ; the objective , twin turrets with heavy @-@ calibre guns mounted on a rotating cupola , was too large for airborne troops from a single glider to destroy on their own , forcing troops from two gliders to be used . Primitive unlined shaped charges were affixed to the turrets and detonated , but whilst they shook the turrets they did not destroy them , and other airborne troops were forced to climb the turrets and smash the gun barrels .",

  "The design challenges the Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair ( C & R ) faced with this class were considerable , as the combined requirements of optimum hitting power , extreme speed and adequate protection taxed the knowledge of its naval architects and the technology of the time . The desired speed of 35 knots had been attained previously only in destroyers and smaller craft . To do so with a capital ship required a hull and a power plant of unprecedented size for a U.S. naval vessel and careful planning on the part of its designers to ensure it would have enough longitudinal strength to withstand bending forces underway and the added stresses on its structure associated with combat . Even so , it took years between initial and final designs for engine and boiler technology to provide a plant of sufficient power that was also compact enough to allow a practical degree of protection , even in such large ships .",
  "The Baths were built around hot springs , the only ones naturally occurring in the United Kingdom . Archaeological evidence suggests that the main spring in its natural state was treated as a shrine by the Celts . During the early Roman occupation of Britain , in the 60s or 70s AD , engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead . These still survive . At this early stage the spring was an open pool in the corner of the temple precinct . It fed a bathing complex on its south side within a barrel @-@ vaulted building . The complex was gradually built up over the next 300 years .

  "The predominant tree in Yellowstone , the lodgepole pine , fared poorly from the fires , except in areas where the heat and flames were very mild . The lodgepole pine is serotinous and often produces pine cones that remain closed and will not disperse seeds unless subjected to fire . Research of test plots established after the fires indicated that the best seed dispersal occurred in areas which had experienced severe ground fires , and that seed dispersal was lowest in areas which had only minor surface burns . Regions with crown fires sometimes had the highest rates of regeneration of lodgepole pine after 5 years . However , the rate of lodgepole regeneration was not uniform , with some areas seeing extremely high densities of new growth while other areas had less . Stands of dead lodgepole killed by the fires may persist for decades , rising above new growth and providing habitat for birds and other wildlife .",

The new government was a threat to Beach Thomas 's view of the world because , in the words of literary critic Robert Hemmings , it saw the countryside \" as merely a giant dairy and granary for the city . \"",

  "Tropical Storm Emily was a weak Atlantic tropical cyclone that brought torrential rains to much of the northern Caribbean in 2011 . The fifth named storm of the annual hurricane season , Emily developed from a strong but poorly organized tropical wave that tracked the open Atlantic for several days in late July . On August 1 , it approached the Lesser Antilles and became better defined , producing inclement weather over much of the area . Two days later , the disturbance developed a closed wind circulation center , marking the formation of Tropical Storm Emily . The storm remained fairly disorganized as it proceeded into the Caribbean , though it generated strong thunderstorms and gusty winds along its path . On August 4 , Emily was declassified as a tropical cyclone , after the mountainous areas of Hispaniola disrupted its weak circulation . Upon exiting the northeastern Caribbean on August 6 , its remnants regenerated into a tropical storm , ultimately dissipating the next day .",
