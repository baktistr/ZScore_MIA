  "Tippett described himself as the receiver of inspiration rather than its originator , the creative spark coming from a particular personal experience , which might take one of many forms but was most often associated with listening to music . The process of composing was lengthy and laborious , the actual writing down of the music being preceded by several stages of gestation ; as Tippett put it , \" the concepts come first , and then a lot of work and imaginative processes until eventually , when you 're ready , finally ready , you look for the actual notes \" . Tippett elaborated : \" I compose by first developing an overall sense of the length of the work , then of how it will divide itself into sections or movements , then of the kind of texture or instruments or voices that will be performing it . I prefer not to consider the actual notes of the composition until this process ... has gone as far as possible \" . Sometimes the time required to see a project through from conception to completion was very lengthy — seven years , Tippett says , in the case of the Third Symphony . In the earlier , contemplative stages he might be simultaneously engaged on other works , but once these stages were complete he would dedicate entirely himself to the completion of the work in hand . Tippett preferred to compose in full score ; once the writing began , progress was often not fluent , as evidenced by Tippett 's first pencil draft manuscripts which show multiple rubbings @-@ out and reworkings . In this , the musicologist Thomas Schuttenhelm says , his methods resembled those of Beethoven , with the difference that \" whereas Beethoven 's struggle is considered a virtue of his work , and almost universally admired , Tippett 's was the source and subject of a debate about his competency as a composer \" .",

  "Independent twin sets or independent doubles consists of two independent cylinders and two regulators , each with a submersible pressure gauge . This system is heavier , more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set .

If this is not done , then if a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve . Independent twin sets do not work well with air @-@ integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder . The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies .

  "The French had recognised the importance of these islands as bases for raiding warships during the French Revolutionary Wars ( 1793 – 1801 ) , but by late 1807 the only naval resources allocated to the region were a few older frigates and a large number of local privateers . Following the reduction of these remaining naval forces on Isle de France during 1808 , by defeat in battle and disarmaments due to age and unseaworthiness , the French naval authorities made a serious attempt to disrupt British trade in the region , ordering five large modern frigates to sail to Isle de France under Commodore Jacques Hamelin .

  "Initially , detailed analysis of KBOs was impossible , and so astronomers were only able to determine the most basic facts about their makeup , primarily their color . These first data showed a broad range of colors among KBOs , ranging from neutral grey to deep red . This suggested that their surfaces were composed of a wide range of compounds , from dirty ices to hydrocarbons . This diversity was startling , as astronomers had expected KBOs to be uniformly dark , having lost most of the volatile ices from their surfaces to the effects of cosmic rays . Various solutions were suggested for this discrepancy , including resurfacing by impacts or outgassing . However , Jewitt and Luu 's spectral analysis of the known Kuiper belt objects in 2001 found that the variation in color was too extreme to be easily explained by random impacts .

  "Another way that machinima demonstrates intertextuality is in its tendency to make frequent references to texts , works , and other media just like TV ads or humorous cartoons such as The Simpsons might do . For example , the machinima series Freeman 's Mind , created by Ross Scott is filmed by taking a recording of Scott playing through the game Half Life as a player normally would and combining it with a voiceover ( also recorded by Scott ) to emulate an inner monologue of the normally voiceless protagonist Gordon Freeman . Scott portrays Freeman as a snarky , sociopathic character who makes frequent references to works and texts including science fiction , horror films , action movies , American history , and renowned novels such as Moby Dick . These references to works outside the game , often triggered by events within the game , are prime examples of the densely intertextual nature of machinima .",

  "An origin myth from the Murri people of Queensland , cited by Andrew Lang , describes how the Australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage . The pelican , formerly a black bird , made a canoe during a flood in order to save drowning people . He fell in love with a woman he thus saved , but she and her friends tricked him and escaped . The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint . However , before he had finished , another pelican , on seeing such a strange piebald creature , killed him with its beak , and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since .",

  "On 25 February 1944 Wing Commander Dick Cresswell , who had previously commanded No. 77 Squadron , was appointed No. 1 Wing 's new wing leader . Creswell 's posting to this role was made upon the request of Jeffery , who tasked him with reducing the wing 's rate of flying accidents . Creswell achieved this through instructing pilots to make ' power on ' approaches and landings and having the Spitfires ' wheels modified . On 8 March , No. 1 Wing was ordered to urgently dispatch No. 452 and No. 457 Squadrons to the vicinity of Perth , Western Australia in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force would raid the area . Both squadrons arrived at RAAF Station Guildford on 12 March after a long flight in severe weather conditions during which one Spitfire crashed at Carnarvon and another made a forced landing at Gingin . On the day of their arrival the two squadrons assumed responsibility for air defence of the Perth @-@ Fremantle area alongside the CAC Boomerang @-@ equipped No. 85 Squadron RAAF . No attack eventuated , however , and the Spitfire squadrons were directed to return to Darwin on 20 March . During this period the Kittyhawk @-@ equipped No. 84 Squadron was transferred from Horn Island to Livingstone Airfield to replace the Spitfires while they were at Perth ; this unit arrived at Livingstone on 12 March and departed twelve days later . On 18 April the wing made strafing attacks on Japanese positions in the Babar Islands . Later that month No. 452 Squadron converted to the more advanced Mark VIII Spitfire . In May 1944 , No. 1 Wing 's headquarters and No. 57 and 457 Squadrons were deployed to Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia to protect the facilities which had been established to refuel the British Eastern Fleet before Operation Transom , during which it attacked Surabaya in Java . This deployment was hampered by a shortage of transport aircraft and inadequate facilities at Exmouth Gulf and the airstrips en route to the area . Cresswell also left the wing in May to become the wing leader of No. 81 Wing . On 12 June No. 452 Squadron aircraft shot down a Dinah . Despite the limited Japanese air activity , Air Vice Marshal Cole continued to regard No. 1 Wing as being \" essential \" to the defence of the North Western Area and in May reported that he could not release it for other duties .",
  "A new method to study lipid bilayers is Atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) . Rather than using a beam of light or particles , a very small sharpened tip scans the surface by making physical contact with the bilayer and moving across it , like a record player needle . AFM is a promising technique because it has the potential to image with nanometer resolution at room temperature and even under water or physiological buffer , conditions necessary for natural bilayer behavior . Utilizing this capability , AFM has been used to examine dynamic bilayer behavior including the formation of transmembrane pores ( holes ) and phase transitions in supported bilayers . Another advantage is that AFM does not require fluorescent or isotopic labeling of the lipids , since the probe tip interacts mechanically with the bilayer surface . Because of this , the same scan can image both lipids and associated proteins , sometimes even with single @-@ molecule resolution . AFM can also probe the mechanical nature of lipid bilayers .",

  "After 1551 , the Reformation advanced further , with the approval and encouragement of Edward , who began to exert more personal influence in his role as Supreme Head of the church . The new changes were also a response to criticism from such reformers as John Hooper , Bishop of Gloucester , and the Scot John Knox , who was employed as a minister in Newcastle under the Duke of Northumberland and whose preaching at court prompted the king to oppose kneeling at communion . Cranmer was also influenced by the views of the continental reformer Martin Bucer , who died in England in 1551 , by Peter Martyr , who was teaching at Oxford , and by other foreign theologians . The progress of the Reformation was further speeded by the consecration of more reformers as bishops .

According to Elton , the publication of Cranmer 's revised prayer book in 1552 , supported by a second Act of Uniformity , \" marked the arrival of the English Church at protestantism \" . The prayer book of 1552 remains the foundation of the Church of England 's services . However , Cranmer was unable to implement all these reforms once it became clear in spring 1553 that King Edward , upon whom the whole Reformation in England depended , was dying .",

For example , in common usage theories such as \" the Earth revolves around the Sun \" and \" objects fall due to gravity \" may be referred to as \" facts , \" even though they are purely theoretical . From a scientific standpoint , therefore , evolution may be called a \" fact \" for the same reason that gravity can : under the scientific definition , evolution is an observable process that occurs whenever a population of organisms genetically changes over time . Under the colloquial definition , the theory of evolution can also be called a fact , referring to this theory 's well @-@ established nature .

  "The jump is a three @-@ stage process . First , the grasshopper fully flexes the lower part of the leg ( tibia ) against the upper part ( femur ) by activating the flexor tibiae muscle ( the back legs of the immature grasshopper in the top photograph are in this preparatory position ) . Second , there is a period of co @-@ contraction in which force builds up in the large , pennate extensor tibiae muscle , but the tibia is kept flexed by the simultaneous contraction of the flexor tibiae muscle . The extensor muscle is much stronger than the flexor muscle , but the latter is aided by specializations in the joint that give it a large effective mechanical advantage over the former when the tibia is fully flexed . Co @-@ contraction can last for up to half a second , and during this period the extensor muscle shortens and stores elastic strain energy by distorting stiff cuticular structures in the leg . The extensor muscle contraction is quite slow ( almost isometric ) , which allows it to develop high force ( up to 14 N in the desert locust ) , but because it is slow only low power is needed . The third stage of the jump is the trigger relaxation of the flexor muscle , which releases the tibia from the flexed position . The subsequent rapid tibial extension is driven mainly by the relaxation of the elastic structures , rather than by further shortening of the extensor muscle . In this way the stiff cuticle acts like the elastic of a catapult , or the bow of a bow @-@ and @-@ arrow . Energy is put into the store at low power by slow but strong muscle contraction , and retrieved from the store at high power by rapid relaxation of the mechanical elastic structures .",

The developers had started from scratch to try to create new characters and venues that would be more reactive to the actual songs being played , to give the feel of a music video , but ultimately this proved too much of a challenge and had to be scrapped . Further , with a limited budget , the song selection was limited to \" low @-@ budget \" hits of the 1990s , or at times reusing songs that had previously been included in Guitar Hero games . Though the team had a two @-@ year development cycle , it was closed down after Activision president Eric Hirshberg had seen the current state of the project at the one @-@ year point . Daniel Dilallo , a developer for Vicarious Visions at the time of cancellation , stated that he had come up with an idea of revitalizing the series using a first @-@ person perspective approach , and had developed a prototype that he had called Guitar Hero Live at the time , though neither Activision nor FreeStyleGames have confirmed if this prototype was used as inspiration for the revived series .",
  "Heraldry , the practice of designing , displaying , describing , and recording coats of arms and badges , arose from the need to distinguish participants in combat when their faces were hidden by iron and steel helmets . The process of creating coats of arms ( these are often called \" family crests \" but in the heraldic traditions of England and Scotland an individual , rather than a family , had a coat of arms ) began in the eight and 9th centuries . Eventually a formal system of rules developed into increasingly complex forms of heraldry that allowed the use of coats of arms by countries , states , provinces , towns and villages in a form of civic heraldry . In more recent times coats of arms have evolved from their military origins to denote educational institutes , and other establishments , apparently leading to the modern logo and corporate livery .",

  "Most of the gyromitrin must be removed to render false morels edible . The recommended procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms , or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly . To prepare fresh mushroom it is recommended that they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water , at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms , for at least five minutes , after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water . Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth . The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain , therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling . Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin ; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90 % of gyromitrin . However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying .",

  "Harmless to humans , the puffadder shyshark can be easily caught by hand . Not targeted by commercial fisheries because of its small size , it is taken incidentally and discarded by bottom trawlers operating between Mossel Bay and East London , and by fishing boats in False Bay . Many are hooked by recreational anglers casting from the shore , who also generally discard or kill them as minor pests . Some local exploitation of this species does occur for lobster bait and the aquarium trade . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the puffadder shyshark as Near Threatened . Although it remains abundant , the small range of this shark lies entirely within a heavily fished region , and any increase in fishing activities or habitat degradation could potentially impact the entire population .",

In many of the recessed areas decoration was added by either engraving or punching which would show through the translucent enamel , or to facet the background so the reflections change as the viewing angle changes slightly . In these last @-@ mentioned areas cutting tools were used . Most of the background outside the enamelled areas was decorated in the same way .

According to Hatley , this is rendered more ironic by both characters being naked during the discussion . She also notes that Saman touches on the traditional archetype of feminine power drawn from nature and the supernatural , and it reinterprets the hero archetype through Saman , who is small , thin , and inexperienced with women but able to withstand torture and defend a community of rubber tappers .",
  "All elements in this group are metals . The similarity of the metallic radii of cadmium and mercury is an effect of the lanthanide contraction . So , the trend in this group is unlike the trend in group 2 , the alkaline earths , where metallic radius increases smoothly from top to bottom of the group . All three metals have relatively low melting and boiling points , indicating that the metallic bond is relatively weak , with relatively little overlap between the valence band and the conduction band . Thus , zinc is close to the boundary between metallic and metalloid elements , which is usually placed between gallium and germanium , though gallium participates in semi @-@ conductors such as gallium arsenide .",

  "Many royal and baronial castles were left to decline , so that by the 15th century only a few were maintained for defensive purposes .

Such structures were , however , beyond the means of all but royalty and the richest of the late @-@ medieval barons . Although gunpowder weapons were used to defend castles from the late 14th century onwards it became clear during the 16th century that , provided artillery could be transported and brought to bear on a besieged castle , gunpowder weapons could also play an important attack role . The defences of coastal castles around the British Isles were improved to deal with this threat , but investment in their upkeep once again declined at the end of the 16th century . Nevertheless , in the widespread civil and religious conflicts across the British Isles during the 1640s and 1650s , castles played a key role in England . Modern defences were quickly built alongside existing medieval fortifications and , in many cases , castles successfully withstood more than one siege . In Ireland the introduction of heavy siege artillery by Oliver Cromwell in 1649 brought a rapid end to the utility of castles in the war , while in Scotland the popular tower houses proved unsuitable for defending against civil war artillery – although major castles such as Edinburgh put up strong resistance . At the end of the war many castles were slighted to prevent future use .",

  "No German team was allowed at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London or the Winter Games in St. Moritz .

  "Skyward Sword began development in 2006 , after the release of The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess for GameCube and Wii . It was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis & Development , a development division of series publisher Nintendo . Its producer was Eiji Aonuma , a major contributor to the Legend of Zelda series . His main preoccupation during these early stages was whether the developers could continue creating The Legend of Zelda titles using the same development mindset that had been used up to Twilight Princess . The game 's director was Hidemaro Fujibayashi : previously working as assistant director on The Legend of Zelda : Phantom Hourglass for the Nintendo DS , Skyward Sword was his first project for home consoles . He began work on Skyward Sword after finishing Phantom Hourglass , and continued working on the game alongside his work on The Legend of Zelda : Spirit Tracks . When Spirit Tracks was finished , Fujibayashi and the game 's development team transferred back to working on Skyward Sword .",
  "S by Shakira is the first woman 's fragrance by Colombian singer songwriter Shakira .

  "[ I ] t is very unusual , even in cases of conquest , for the conqueror to do more than to displace the sovereign and assume dominion over the country . The modern usage of nations , which has become law , would be violated ; that sense of justice and of right which is acknowledged and felt by the whole civilized world would be outraged , if private property should be generally confiscated , and private rights annulled . The people change their allegiance ; their relation to their ancient sovereign is dissolved ; but their relations to each other , and their rights of property , remain undisturbed . If this be the modern rule , even in cases of conquest , who can doubt its application to the case of an amicable cession of territory ? Had Florida changed its sovereign by an act containing no stipulation respecting the property of individuals , the right of property in all those who became subjects or citizens of the new government would have been unaffected by the change ; it would have remained the same as under the ancient sovereign . . . . A cession of territory is never understood to be a cession of the property belonging to its inhabitants . The king cedes that only which belonged to him ; lands he had previously granted , were not his to cede . Neither party could so understand the cession ; neither party could consider itself as attempting a wrong to individuals , condemned by the practice of the whole civilized world . The cession of a territory , by its name , from one sovereign to another , conveying the compound idea of surrendering at the same time the lands and the people who inhabit them , would be necessarily understood to pass the sovereignty only , and not to interfere with private property .",

  "The chacma baboon often sleeps in large groups on cliffs or in trees at night to avoid predators . The morning dispersal from the sleeping site is synchronized , with all members leaving at the same time . In most cases , dispersal is initiated by a single individual , and the other members of the group decide whether or not to follow . At least five followers must be recruited for a successful dispersal initiation , and not all initiation attempts are successful . Surprisingly , the initiator 's dominance status shows little correlation with successful initiation of departure ; more @-@ dominant individuals are no more likely to lead a successful departure than subordinate individuals . One study has shown that while the success rate of dispersal initiation attempts is relatively constant across all sexes , male are more likely to attempt initiation than females , and lactating females are less likely to attempt initiation than females without dependent offspring . A separate study has achieved slightly different results . While dominance hierarchy does not play a significant role in initiating the morning dispersal , social affiliation does . Chacma baboons that play a more central role in the group ( as measured by grooming behavior and time spent with other members ) are more likely to be followed during the morning dispersal . This study concluded that group members are more likely to follow the behavior of individuals with which they are closely affiliated .",

  "As fascism and militarism advanced in Europe , Lansbury 's pacifist stance drew criticism from the trades union elements of his party — who controlled the majority of party conference votes . Walter Citrine , the TUC general secretary , commented that Lansbury \" thinks the country should be without defence of any kind ... it certainly isn 't our policy . \" The party 's 1935 annual conference took place in Brighton during October , under the shadow of Italy 's impending invasion of Abyssinia . The national executive had tabled a resolution calling for sanctions against Italy , which Lansbury opposed as a form of economic warfare . His speech — a passionate exposition of the principles of Christian pacifism — was well received by the delegates , but immediately afterwards his position was destroyed by Ernest Bevin , the Transport and General Workers ' Union leader . Bevin attacked Lansbury for putting his private beliefs before a policy , agreed by all the party 's main institutions , to oppose fascist aggression , and accused him of \" hawking your conscience round from body to body asking to be told what to do with it \" . Union support ensured that the sanctions resolution was carried by a huge majority ; Lansbury , realising that a Christian pacifist could no longer lead the party , resigned a few days later .",

  "In the sport 's early history , the International Sports Organization for the Disabled ( ISOD ) , founded in 1964 , governed the sport . In 1980 , there were two governing bodies handling classification , ISOD and the International Stoke Mandeville Games Committee ( ISMGC ) , which later became the International Stoke Mandeville Games Federation ( ISMGF ) , and still later the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation ( ISMWSF ) . ISMGC was in charge of classification for athletes with spinal cord related disabilities . In 1981 , the International Blind Sports Federation ( IBSA ) was created , and took over governance for skiers with visual impairments . In 2003 , ISMWSF merged with ISOD , and changed its name to the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation ( IWAS ) in 2004 . While the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association ( CP @-@ ISRA ) has an interest in the sport because it is open to people with cerebral palsy , it is not governed by them .

  "On December 1 , 2011 , following the death of Florida A & M University drum major Robert Champion , the Delta Iota chapter was placed on investigative hold pending an investigation by the national fraternity . In January 2012 , the Tallahassee Democrat reported alleged hazing by the FAMU chapter in spring 2010 . According to the allegations , two members of the FAMU band faculty were involved in a hazing incident at a professor 's home in which prospective members were struck on the back and neck and forced to recite information . The fraternity 's investigation was postponed at the request of FAMU due to the ongoing police investigation . The investigations cleared Delta Iota of any connection to Champion 's death ; Champion was not a member or prospective member of the fraternity . After the conclusion of both the police and fraternity investigations , the national council closed down the chapter because of its violations of fraternity policy and the uncertainty of the future of the FAMU band program . As part of the chapter 's termination , 28 members , including all active and prospective members in spring 2010 , were expelled from the fraternity . Alumni members of the chapter who were present at the hazing were also expelled . Furthermore , the Delta Iota chapter may not return to FAMU before May 2017 . Members who joined the fraternity after spring 2010 were transferred to alumni status but cannot participate in any fraternity events due to the shutdown of the chapter . No criminal charges were filed due to the delay in reporting and investigation .",

  "In 287 BC , the Plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill . To end the secession , a law ( the \" Hortensian Law \" ) was passed , which ended the requirement that the Patrician senators consent before a bill could be brought before the Plebeian Council for a vote . The ultimate significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the Patricians of their final weapon over the Plebeians . The result was that the ultimate control over the state fell , not onto the shoulders of democracy , but onto the shoulders of the new Patricio @-@ Plebeian aristocracy . By the middle of the second century BC , the economic situation for the average Plebeian had declined significantly .

  "Although Etty painted many private portraits of his friends and acquaintances , he produced very few publicly exhibited portraits , fewer than 30 of which were shown during his lifetime . Portraiture was seen as a vulgar and generally worthless form of painting throughout much of the 19th century , and portrait painters continued to be disparaged as a greedy and unimaginative group who survived by feeding the vanity of the emerging middle class . Other than Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball , critics generally disliked his portraits , preferring his history paintings in spite of reservations over his depictions of nudity . Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball did , however , serve as an indication that Etty could successfully paint works as commissions for the English elite , boosting his status and leading to further commissions . Etty died in November 1849 and soon fell from fashion ; by the late 19th century the cost of all his paintings had fallen below their original prices .

  "Formal discipline is administered by congregation elders . When a baptized member is accused of committing a serious sin — usually cases of sexual misconduct or charges of apostasy for disputing Jehovah 's Witness doctrines — a judicial committee is formed to determine guilt , provide help and possibly administer discipline . Disfellowshipping , a form of shunning , is the strongest form of discipline , administered to an offender deemed unrepentant . Contact with disfellowshipped individuals is limited to direct family members living in the same home , and with congregation elders who may invite disfellowshipped persons to apply for reinstatement ; formal business dealings may continue if contractually or financially obliged . Witnesses are taught that avoiding social and spiritual interaction with disfellowshipped individuals keeps the congregation free from immoral influence and that \" losing precious fellowship with loved ones may help [ the shunned individual ] to come ' to his senses , ' see the seriousness of his wrong , and take steps to return to Jehovah . \" The practice of shunning may also serve to deter other members from dissident behavior . Members who disassociate ( formally resign ) are described in Watch Tower Society literature as wicked and are also shunned . Expelled individuals may eventually be reinstated to the congregation if deemed repentant by elders in the congregation in which the disfellowshipping was enforced . Reproof is a lesser form of discipline given formally by a judicial committee to a baptized Witness who is considered repentant of serious sin ; the reproved person temporarily loses conspicuous privileges of service , but suffers no restriction of social or spiritual fellowship . Marking , a curtailing of social but not spiritual fellowship , is practiced if a baptized member persists in a course of action regarded as a violation of Bible principles but not a serious sin .",

In regard to artistic influences , Levine cited the books Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four and Logan 's Run , representing societies that have \" really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we 're people \" . The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton , inspired by films like The Manchurian Candidate , as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player 's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they shouldn 't . The team had agreed that Jack 's actions would be controlled by a key phrase , but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas ' true nature . Levine happened upon \" Would you kindly \" after working on marketing materials for the game that asked the reader hypothetical questions such as \" Would you kill people , even innocent people , to survive ? \" , later working that phrase into the first script for the game . Levine also noted that \" it was never my intention to do two endings for the game . It sort of came very late and it was something that was requested by somebody up the food chain from me . \" Another late addition , in response to lackluster playtesting feedback , was the initial plane crash into the water ; Levine based this on the premise of the television show Lost , as it helped to give enough information to the player about Jack before immersing them in the game , helping them to connect to the character .",

  "In the seventeenth century there was growing scepticism about the reality of witchcraft among the educated elite . Scotland was defeated in the Civil Wars by the forces of the English parliament led by Oliver Cromwell and occupied . In 1652 Scotland was declared part of a Commonwealth with England and Ireland and the Privy Council and courts ceased to exist . The English judges who replaced them were hostile to the use of torture and often sceptical of the evidence it produced , resulting in a decline in prosecutions . In an attempt to gain support among the landholding orders , Sheriff 's courts were re @-@ established and Justices of the Peace returned in 1656 . The result was a wave of witchcraft cases , with 102 in the period 1657 – 59 . The limitations on prosecutions were fully reversed with the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , and there was a flood of over 600 cases that alarmed the restored Privy Council , leading it to insist on the necessity of its commission for an arrest or prosecution , and banning judicial torture .",

  "At 169 m / s , the speed of sound in xenon gas is lower than that in air due to the lower average speed of the heavy xenon atoms compared to nitrogen and oxygen molecules .

In the Singapore High Court decision Lines International Holding ( S ) Pte . Ltd. v.

He views himself as more mature than his fellow friends and classmates , and often grows impatient with their company ; despite claiming to be more mature , he will often break down crying childishly and pathetically whenever he feels defeated . This often leads to loud arguments , which in earlier seasons typically end with Cartman peevishly saying \" Screw you guys ... I 'm going home ! \" and then leaving . In an action King 's College philosophy professor David Kyle Johnson describes as \" directed either toward accomplishing his own happiness or the unhappiness of others \" , Cartman often feigns actual friendship with his classmates when needing a favor . The lack of a true father figure in his life , and Liane 's promiscuity and drug use have caused repressed psychological hardship in Cartman 's life . As a parent , Liane often spoils Cartman , and is largely ineffectual as a disciplinarian . Cartman sometimes commands his mom to do tasks for him , but more often resorts to pleading with her in an ingratiating tone . When neither method works , he resorts to excessive and indecipherable whining , to which Liane usually succumbs .

  "( John Facenda voice ) It was these 1986 Giants that popularized the football tradition of dousing the head coach with a cooler of Gatorade near the end of a victorious game . This originated in 1984 when Jim Burt , incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received during practice , exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him . Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often sneak up on Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head . The dousing was a big hit with fans , and the Gatorade dumping continued throughout the season after each win , with Taylor , Carson , and several other players ( Burt had since ceased doing it ) concocting increasingly elaborate , sneaky , and playful ruses , so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise .",

In an initial experiment , participants rated another person on the introversion – extroversion personality dimension on the basis of an interview .

When the interviewee was introduced as an introvert , the participants chose questions that presumed introversion , such as , \" What do you find unpleasant about noisy parties ? \" When the interviewee was described as extroverted , almost all the questions presumed extroversion , such as , \" What would you do to liven up a dull party ? \" These loaded questions gave the interviewees little or no opportunity to falsify the hypothesis about them .

  "Winds defined by an equilibrium of physical forces are used in the decomposition and analysis of wind profiles . They are useful for simplifying the atmospheric equations of motion and for making qualitative arguments about the horizontal and vertical distribution of winds .

It flows parallel to isobars and approximates the flow above the atmospheric boundary layer in the midlatitudes . The thermal wind is the difference in the geostrophic wind between two levels in the atmosphere . It exists only in an atmosphere with horizontal temperature gradients .

  "John treated the interdict as \" the equivalent of a papal declaration of war \" .

John seized the lands of those clergy unwilling to conduct services , as well as those estates linked to Innocent himself ; he arrested the illicit concubines that many clerics kept during the period , only releasing them after the payment of fines ; he seized the lands of members of the church who had fled England , and he promised protection for those clergy willing to remain loyal to him .

Throughout the Cold War , both the US and USSR repeatedly accused the UN of favoring the other . In 1953 , the USSR effectively forced the resignation of Trygve Lie , the Secretary @-@ General , through its refusal to deal with him , while in the 1950s and 1960s , a popular US bumper sticker read , \" You can 't spell communism without U.N. \" In a sometimes @-@ misquoted statement , President George W. Bush stated in February 2003 ( referring to UN uncertainty towards Iraqi provocations under the Saddam Hussein regime ) that \" free nations will not allow the United Nations to fade into history as an ineffective , irrelevant debating society . \" In contrast , the French President , François Hollande , stated in 2012 that \" France trusts the United Nations . She knows that no state , no matter how powerful , can solve urgent problems , fight for development and bring an end to all crises ... France wants the UN to be the centre of global governance . \" Critics such as Dore Gold , an Israeli diplomat , Robert S.

  "The court also created the plenary power doctrine , holding that the federal court did not have jurisdiction because Congress had not passed a law giving jurisdiction to the federal courts or taking away the rights of the tribe . Crow Dog was the last in a line of sovereignty cases that began with Cherokee Nation ; the next major case , United States v. Kagama , ( 1886 ) , upheld the plenary power of Congress to enact the Major Crimes Act .

Congress subsequently used this power to breach the Medicine Lodge Treaty with the Kiowa by reducing the size of the Kiowa reservation without their consent .

  "When a mosquito carrying dengue virus bites a person , the virus enters the skin together with the mosquito 's saliva . It binds to and enters white blood cells , and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body . The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins , such as cytokines and interferons , which are responsible for many of the symptoms , such as the fever , the flu @-@ like symptoms , and the severe pains . In severe infection , the virus production inside the body is greatly increased , and many more organs ( such as the liver and the bone marrow ) can be affected . Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into body cavities due to capillary permeability . As a result , less blood circulates in the blood vessels , and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs . Furthermore , dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to reduced numbers of platelets , which are necessary for effective blood clotting ; this increases the risk of bleeding , the other major complication of dengue fever .",

He aspired to recognition by the more influential Prague opera , but Jenůfa was refused there ( twelve years passed before its first performance in Prague ) . Dejected and emotionally exhausted , Janáček went to Luhačovice spa to recover . There he met Kamila Urválková , whose love story supplied the theme for his next opera , Osud ( Destiny ) .",
  "Thousands of live bees were used during production , with the understanding that the bees would not sting without a queen present . However , this theory proved incorrect , and Vanessa Morley , who played the Samantha Mulder clones , was stung during filming . She kept quiet and did not react until the scene had finished filming , leading Spotnitz to call her \" a trooper \" . The cold open for the episode , with multiple cloned boys , was achieved with motion control photography , allowing for two children to play all five of the clones ; multiple takes were recorded with the boys in different positions , and with the camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take , these could be seamlessly composited together .",
  "In late 1984 Chrisye approached another young composer , Adjie Soetama , to help him prepare his next album . Light beats and cheerful melodies were in vogue at the time ; therefore the two used a lighter style . Recording for the new album , titled Aku Cinta Dia ( I Love Her ) , began in 1985 , with additional songs from Guruh and Dadang S. Manaf . The titular song was chosen after Aciu heard a jam session led by Adjie and immediately decided that it would be the lead single . The album called for more emoting , which Chrisye – known as having a stiff stage persona – struggled to deliver , though Yanti prepared colourful costumes and Alex Hasyim trained him in choreography . Upon its release , Aku Cinta Dia sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the first week and was eventually certified gold . That same year , Chrisye and Adji Soetama released Hip Hip Hura ( Hip Hip Hurray ! ) , and another collaboration , Nona Lisa ( Miss Lisa ) , was released in 1986 ; the later two albums had similar beats and rhythms and sold well , although not as well as Aku Cinta Dia .

  "Sgt.

The musicologist Kenneth Womack describes the lyric as \" a revolutionary moment in the creative life of the Beatles \" that bridges the gap – sometimes referred to as the Fourth wall – between the audience and the artist . He argues that , paradoxically , the lyrics \" exemplify the mindless rhetoric of rock concert banter \" while \" mock [ ing ] the very notion of a pop album 's capacity for engendering authentic interconnection between artist and audience \" . In his view , the mixed message ironically serves to distance the group from their fans while simultaneously \" gesturing toward \" them as alter egos , an authorial quality that he considers to be \" the song 's most salient feature \" . He credits the recording 's use of a brass ensemble with distorted electric guitars as an early example of rock fusion . MacDonald agrees , describing the track as an overture rather than a song , and a \" shrewd fusion of Edwardian variety orchestra \" and contemporary hard rock . The musicologist Michael Hannan describes the track 's unorthodox stereo mix as \" typical of the album \" , with the lead vocal in the right speaker during the verses , but in the left during the chorus and middle eight . \" Sgt. Pepper \" was the first Beatles track that benefitted from the production technique known as direct injection , which according to Womack \" afforded McCartney 's bass with richer textures and tonal clarity \" .

The five @-@ bar bridge is filled by an Edwardian horn quartet that Martin arranged from a McCartney vocal melody .

  "During the first work by Shinichirō Watanabe on Cowboy Bebop , the first image that came to him was of Spike .

In order to portray him as cool , Toshihiro Kawamoto designed Spike to look \" uncool \" : when he stands still , he has a hunched appearance . This meant that when the character was moving vigorously , he came across as \" extra cool \" .

Yamane liked the English biplane torpedo @-@ bomber Fairey Swordfish , which led him to name the Swordfish II after the bomber .

  "The ketogenic diet is calculated by a dietitian for each child . Age , weight , activity levels , culture and food preferences all affect the meal plan . First , the energy requirements are set at 80 – 90 % of the recommended daily amounts ( RDA ) for the child 's age ( the high @-@ fat diet requires less energy to process than a typical high @-@ carbohydrate diet ) . Highly active children or those with muscle spasticity require more calories than this ; immobile children require less . The ketogenic ratio of the diet compares the weight of fat to the combined weight of carbohydrate and protein . This is typically 4 : 1 , but children who are younger than 18 months , older than 12 years , or who are obese may be started on a 3 : 1 ratio . Fat is energy @-@ rich , with 9 kcal / g ( 38 kJ / g ) compared to 4 kcal / g ( 17 kJ / g ) for carbohydrate or protein , so portions on the ketogenic diet are smaller than normal . The quantity of fat in the diet can be calculated from the overall energy requirements and the chosen ketogenic ratio . Next , the protein levels are set to allow for growth and body maintenance , and are around 1 g protein for each kg of body weight . Lastly , the amount of carbohydrate is set according to what allowance is left while maintaining the chosen ratio . Any carbohydrate in medications or supplements must be subtracted from this allowance . The total daily amount of fat , protein and carbohydrate is then evenly divided across the meals .",

  "All spoken languages have phonemes of at least two different categories , vowels and consonants , that can be combined to form syllables . As well as segments such as consonants and vowels , some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning . Many languages , for example , use stress , pitch , duration , and tone to distinguish meaning . Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments , they are called suprasegmental . Some languages have only a few phonemes , for example , Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively , whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes .

  "In keeping with his move from an ideology of republicanism to one of autocracy , Diocletian 's council of advisers , his consilium , differed from those of earlier emperors . He destroyed the Augustan illusion of imperial government as a cooperative affair between emperor , army , and senate . In its place he established an effectively autocratic structure , a shift later epitomized in the institution 's name : it would be called a consistorium ( \" consistory \" ) , not a council . Diocletian regulated his court by distinguishing separate departments ( scrina ) for different tasks . From this structure came the offices of different magistri , like the Magister officiorum ( \" Master of offices \" ) , and associated secretariats .

Kesselring was slated to be posted to Norway . Kesselring was appalled at the prospect of abandoning Italy . It would expose southern Germany to bombers operating from Italy ; risk the Allies breaking into the Po Valley ; and was completely unnecessary , as he was certain that Rome could be held until the summer of 1944 . This assessment was based on his belief that the Allies would not conduct operations outside the range of their air cover , which could only reach as far as Salerno .

  "Seeking to explain the observed clockwise paleorotation , and noting that Siletzia appeared to have rotated as a rigid block , Simpson & Cox ( 1977 ) proposed two models . First was rotation about a southern pivot in contact with the Klamath Mountains . This has various problems , especially because at the northern end sediments and even boulders from the continent are found at the base of the Crescent Formation , showing that it was near the continent from the beginning . In the second model ( subsequently refined by Hammond 1979 ) , Siletzia was originally adjacent to the Olympic @-@ Wallowa Lineament , then rifted from the continent and rotated about a northern pivot near the Olympic Peninsula . Because sediments also show the Klamaths in close contact from the start , this requires the Klamaths to have moved with Siletzia . Originally there were conflicts in the understanding of when the Klamaths moved , and with the age and amount of rotation of the Clarno Formation in central Oregon .

The intention was not to cut ties with Spain , but to reformulate the relationship ; similarly , the American Revolution was not separatist at its initial steps either .

Some points that would justify the idea would be the inclusion of Larrea , Matheu , and Belgrano in the Junta and the later appearance of José de San Martín : Larrea and Matheu were Spanish , Belgrano studied for many years in Spain , and San Martín had spent most of his adult life waging war in Spain against the French .

To stay in touch with them , O 'Neill began keeping a mailing list and started sending out updates on his progress . A few months later he heard Peter Glaser speak about solar power satellites at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center . O 'Neill realized that , by building these satellites , his space colonies could quickly recover the cost of their construction . According to O 'Neill , \" the profound difference between this and everything else done in space is the potential of generating large amounts of new wealth \" .",

  "If a person whose life has been tried in some crucial difficulty has a friend and sometime later he is unable to retain the past clearly , if anxiety creates confusion , and if accusing thoughts assail him with all their might as he works his way back , then he may go to his friend and say , “ My soul is sick so that nothing will become clear to me , but I confided everything to you ; you remember it , so please explain the past to me again . ” But if a person has no friend , he presumably goes to God if under other circumstances he has confided something to him , if in the hour of decision he called God as witness when no one understood him . And the one who went to his friend perhaps was not understood at times , perhaps was filled with self @-@ loathing , which is even more oppressive , upon discovering that the one to whom he had confided his troubles had not understood him at all , even though he had listened , had not sensed what was making him anxious , but had only an inquisitive interest in his unusual encounter with life .

On the contrary , it can become very hard ; it may become more difficult than the contemptible easiness of sensate human life , but in this difficulty life also acquires ever deeper and deeper meaning .

  "This rockfowl builds its nest onto the sides of rocks , normally in caves , where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within , or on nearly vertical cliff faces , which can be either bare or have some vegetation , though never woody branches , near the nest . Nests need to be built under an overhang to protect it from water , and the rock surface normally slopes forward slightly . The nests are almost always found near water , which can be in the form of either streams or forest pools . These streams , particularly those located at the base of a nesting cliff , help keep predators away from the nests . Nests on rock surfaces are normally built 1 @.@ 2 to 5 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 to 17 @.@ 1 ft ) above the ground . In addition to the rock face nests , there is a record of a nest being constructed on the buttress root of a Piptadeniastrum tree above a small stream . Two nests were even built onto a concrete bridge in Gabon 's Lopé National Park . The male and female rockfowl work equally on the nest 's construction , and it can take two to three months to build one , though in some extreme cases it takes more than a year . The nest itself is a half @-@ cup constructed of dry mud with grass fibres and dead leaves mixed in , often with the plant matter sticking out of the nest 's walls .

Linois 's squadron had captured a number of merchant vessels during their voyage but this was their first warship , and although it was no match for size , Speedy was an infamous vessel under the command of Captain Lord Cochrane . Cochrane had spent the last year raiding the Spanish coast with great success , taking or destroying more than 50 ships including the celebrated Action of 6 May 1801 in which Cochrane had attacked and captured the far larger Spanish privateer frigate Gamo off Barcelona . Cochrane 's initial belief that the strange ships were Spanish treasure vessels caused him to bring Speedy closer to the ships and by the time he realised his error escape was impossible . Rather than surrender however , Cochrane threw all of his guns and excessive weight overboard and manoeuvered his ship to avoid coming into range of the French broadsides . He then attempted to cut directly between the approaching Formidable and Desaix , the small target avoiding the concentrated fire of the French ships and pulling into open water . At this , Commodore Jean @-@ Anne Christy @-@ Pallière on Desaix swung his ship about and pursued , several shots damaging Speedy 's sails and rigging . As Speedy slowed , Desaix overtook the small brig and fired a full broadside at close range . This was fired as the French ship was on the uproll and therefore missed the deck entirely and failed to cause a single casualty . It did however tear away the remaining rigging and sails , leaving Speedy unmanageable . Rather than suffer another broadside , Cochrane surrendered his ship and was taken aboard Desaix , where Christy @-@ Pallière acknowledged his brave defence by refusing to accept Cochrane 's surrendered sword with the words \" I will not accept the sword of an officer who has for so many hours struggled against impossibility \" .

Through several banners hung on bridges throughout the state of Michoacán , La Familia Michoacana publicly announced that they were open to the possibility of creating a \" truce \" ( ceasefire ) with the Mexican government throughout December 2010 and January 2011 to prove that they were not the source of the violence .

  "Several major weaknesses in Kaga 's design were not rectified . Kaga 's aviation fuel tanks were incorporated directly into the structure of the carrier , meaning that shocks to the ship , such as those caused by bomb or shell hits , would be transmitted directly to the tanks , resulting in cracks or leaks . Also , the fully enclosed structure of the new hangar decks made fire suppression difficult , at least in part because fuel vapors could accumulate in the hangars . Adding to the danger was the requirement from the Japanese carrier doctrine that aircraft be serviced , fueled , and armed whenever possible on the hangar decks rather than on the flight deck . In addition , the carrier 's hangar and flight decks carried little armor protection . Furthermore , there was no redundancy in the ship 's fire @-@ extinguishing systems . These weaknesses would later be crucial factors in the loss of the ship .",

  "One possibility is that , whilst Somairle may well have begun the planning of a Cistercian house at Saddell , it was actually Ragnall who provided it with its first endowments . Somairle 's attempt to relocate Colum Cille 's familia to Iona , however , was undertaken during an era when Cistercians were already established in Ireland and the Isles , which may be evidence that Somairle was something of an \" ecclesiastical traditionalist \" who found newer reformed orders of continental Christianity unpalatable . Whatever the case , the ecclesiastical activities of his immediate descendants , especially the foundations and endowments of Ragnall himself , reveal that the meic Somairle were not averse to such continental orders . During his career , Somairle waged war upon the Scots and perished in an invasion of Scotland proper , which could suggest that Ragnall 's ecclesiastical activities were partly undertaken to improve relations with the King of Scots .

  "Under the Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer James Callaghan , the Finance Act 1965 replaced the system of income tax and profits tax from 1 April 1965 with a single measure , the Corporation Tax , which re @-@ introduced aspects of the old system . Corporation Tax was charged at a uniform rate on all profits , but additional tax was then payable if profits were distributed as a dividend to shareholders . In effect , dividends suffered double taxation . This method of corporation tax is known as the classical system and is similar to that used in the United States . The effect of the tax was to revert to the distribution tax in operation from 1949 to 1959 : dividend payments were subject to higher tax than profits retained within the company .",
  "Dowding saw 12 Group as the protector of the Midlands and a reserve for 11 Group . Mallory and Bader wanted to ignore both the defence of the Midlands and keeping a reserve in order to commit 12 Group to battle . In essence , they proposed the opposite of Dowding and resolved to commit the reserves before the front @-@ line units . While this method may have spared 11 Group , it had its problems . Although Mallory and Bader wanted to stop the enemy before it hit RAF airfields , the amount of time it took to position large formations for interception meant that the Big Wing often failed to achieve this . Instead , they engaged the enemy as he withdrew . Prompted by a supporting comment from Leigh @-@ Mallory , to the effect that it did not matter when an intertception was made , as long as it accounted for a large number of enemy aircraft , Bader announced that he would rather destroy 50 German bombers after hitting their targets than 10 before . The argument was strong ; crippling losses would act as a deterrent , so that damage sustained on an occasion when the Germans did get through would have to be offset against later occasions when they did not even care to try .",

Other newspapers accused \" Death on the Rock \" of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses ' statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast . The eyewitnesses interviewed for \" Death on the Rock \" gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings ; most repeated the statements they had given the programme , but one witness — who had told the programme he had seen a soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground — retracted his previous statement . As a result of the retraction , Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of \" Death on the Rock \" — the first time an inquiry had been commissioned into the making of an individual documentary . The Windlesham – Rampton report found that the programme 's tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed , but that it sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion . The authors made several criticisms of the documentary , but overall found it a \" trenchant \" work of journalism , made in \" good faith and without ulterior motives \" . Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished as a result of the Broadcasting Act 1990 — decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the government 's anger at \" Death on the Rock \" .",
  "Elephants typically coexist peacefully with other herbivores , which will usually stay out of their way . Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded . At Aberdare National Park , Kenya , a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group . At Hluhluwe – Umfolozi Game Reserve , South Africa , introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that claimed the lives of 36 rhinos during the 1990s , but ended with the introduction of older males . The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators , though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers . Calves may be preyed on by lions , spotted hyenas , and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia . The lions of Savuti , Botswana , have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season , and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years . Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards ( which have not been recorded killing calves ) ; the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to . Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites , particularly nematodes , compared to other herbivores . This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads .",

  "The couple moved repeatedly over the following year – first to Laguna Beach , California , then to Santa Catalina Island , California , New York City , Stroudsburg , Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard 's first wife 's home at South Colby , Washington . Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce on the grounds of desertion and non @-@ support , and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Sara , let alone that he had married her . The arrival of Hubbard and Sara three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard 's family , who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly .

  "Following King Edward 's death on 5 January 1066 , the lack of a clear heir led to a disputed succession in which several contenders laid claim to the throne of England . Edward 's immediate successor was the Earl of Wessex , Harold Godwinson , the richest and most powerful of the English aristocrats and son of Godwin , Edward 's earlier opponent . Harold was elected king by the Witenagemot of England and crowned by Archbishop of York Ealdred , although Norman propaganda claimed that the ceremony was performed by Stigand , the uncanonically elected Archbishop of Canterbury . Harold was at once challenged by two powerful neighbouring rulers . Duke William claimed that he had been promised the throne by King Edward and that Harold had sworn agreement to this . Harald III of Norway , commonly known as Harald Hardrada , also contested the succession . His claim to the throne was based on an agreement between his predecessor Magnus I of Norway and the earlier King of England Harthacanute , whereby , if either died without heir , the other would inherit both England and Norway . William and Harald immediately set about assembling troops and ships for separate invasions .",

  "A variety of jewellery , beads , and charms was also found . 100 beads in total were recovered from 16 graves , though only two had more than 10 beads .

Holes had been drilled in the coins , which were more than 600 years old by the time they were buried , to convert them into items of jewellery . Their excellent condition suggests that they had not been used for long , or at all , as currency ; it is possible that they had been part of a hoard buried shortly after they were minted and were rediscovered during Saxon times . The discovery of Roman coins in a Saxon grave of this period is unique to the Street House cemetery .

He informs Locke that they will be strangers at their next meeting , and thus gives him a compass to get his younger self to trust Locke .

  "At dawn , lookouts on Greyhound were able to establish that Victoria was a large merchant ship rather than a warship and Elphinstone was encouraged to resume the attack . Aalbers sailed shortly afterwards , his ships tacking away from the shore in line of battle ready for the British advance . In doing so , Pallas drew ahead of the next ship in line , creating a gap through which the British attack could be directed . At 05 : 00 , Elphinstone raised French colours in an effort to confuse the Dutch officers and indicated that he wished to speak with the Dutch commander . Aalbers was not fooled , and when Elphinstone opened fire on Pallas at close range at 05 : 30 , the Dutch frigate replied immediately . With the frigates engaged , Harrier cut between Pallas and Victoria , Troubridge discharging his carronades into Victoria and ordering his crew to fire muskets at the deck of Pallas . In response , Victoria and Batavier pulled out of the line to engage Harrier , which continued its fire against Pallas , while William , bringing up the rear of the Dutch line , pulled out completely and sailed for the coast .",

Defying previous forecasts , Hellen continued on a southeasterly track toward Madagascar and the likelihood of it making landfall became apparent . By the end of March 30 , Hellen 's eye had collapsed and disappeared from satellite imagery , as the combination of dry air and land interaction took their toll on the storm . At about 0800 UTC on March 31 , Hellen made landfall on northwestern Madagascar , and the previously unfavorable conditions coupled with land interaction to induce rapid weakening . The ridge to the east turned Hellen to a southwest drift over land .

  "The large number of Guitar Hero and Rock Band titles on the market is considered to be partially responsible for the sharp decline of music game sales in the latter half of 2009 , along with the effects of the late @-@ 2000s recession . The market for rhythm games was $ 1 @.@ 4 billion in 2008 , but dropped to $ 700 million in 2009 even though more titles were available that year .

According to Bright , sales of all the Guitar Hero games released in 2009 totaled the number of sales of the 2008 title World Tour , demonstrating the dilution of the marketing . Though Activision had originally planned on tripling the offerings of the Guitar Hero series in 2010 , the company readjusted their plans , reducing the number of offerings and focusing more on selling digital downloadable content for the series .

Although the plot was grandiose , the critic noted that : \" it sounds – and is – fantastic ; the skill of Mr. Fleming is to be measured by the fact that it is made not to seem so . \" For The Times Literary Supplement , Michael Robson considered that \" a new Bond has emerged from these pages : an agent more relaxed , less promiscuous , less stagily muscular than of yore . \" Bond was not the only thing that was more relaxed , according to Robson , as \" the story , too , is more relaxed . \" Robson saw this as a positive development , but it did mean that although \" there are incidental displays of the virtuosity to which Mr. Fleming has accustomed us , ... the narrative does not slip into top gear until Goldfinger unfolds his plan \" . The Evening Standard looked at why Bond was a success and listed \" the things that make Bond attractive : the sex , the sadism , the vulgarity of money for its own sake , the cult of power , the lack of standards \" . The Sunday Times called Goldfinger \" Guilt @-@ edged Bond \" , whilst the Manchester Evening News thought that \" Only Fleming could have got away with it ... outrageously improbable , wickedly funny , wildly exciting \" .",

  "The ensuing battle was bloody , but was decided when Li Shimin and a part of his cavalry broke through the Xia lines and reached the eastern escarpment , planting the Tang banners in full view of both armies . Possibly coupled with the arrival of the flanking Tang cavalry , this development caused the complete collapse of the Xia army : trapped between the Tang forces and the eastern cliffs , 3 @,@ 000 Xia soldiers fell in the field or the subsequent pursuit , but more than 50 @,@ 000 were taken prisoner .

  "As a result , the text of Asser 's Life is known from a multitude of different sources . Various transcripts had been made of the Cotton manuscript and a facsimile of the first page of the manuscript had been made and published , giving more direct evidence for the hand of the scribe . In addition to these transcripts , the extracts mentioned above made by other early writers have been used to help assemble and assess the text . Because of the lack of the manuscript itself and because Parker 's annotations had been copied by some transcribers as if they were part of the text , scholarly editions have had a difficult burden . There have been multiple editions of The Life published , both in Latin and in translation . The 1904 critical edition by W. H. Stevenson , Asser 's Life of King Alfred , together with the Annals of Saint Neots erroneously ascribed to Asser , still provides the standard text . An important recent translation , with thorough notes on the scholarly problems and issues , is Alfred the Great : Asser 's Life of King Alfred and Other Contemporary Sources by Simon Keynes and Michael Lapidge .",

  "University lecturer Zaini Ujang viewed Yesterday and Today 's comparisons as criticisms of society , putting forth the question of whether people should accept \" development \" to simply mean discarding the old for the new without regards to its value . Professor Fuziah of the National University of Malaysia interpreted the book 's ending as a wakeup call to parents , questioning them if they should deny their children a more relaxed childhood . Lent agreed , saying that Lat had asserted the theme from the start , showing him and his childhood friends \" not in a hurry to grow up \" . Redza hinted that Lat 's other goal was to point out the \" dehumanising environment \" that Malaysian urban children are growing up in . A Japanese edition of Yesterday and Today was published by Berita Publishing in 1998 .",
  "The Petitcodiac River watershed covers an area north and east of the Caledonian Highlands ; a low @-@ elevation ( on average 67 m ; 220 ft ) region with rolling hills , valleys , and ridges . In fact , most of the region was below sea level , beneath the former DeGeer and Goldthwait seas , during the quaternary period . Non @-@ calcareous Pennsylvanian ( and younger ) sandstones , conglomerates , silt , and red- to grey @-@ tinted mudstone now compose the majority of the bedrock . The northern shore of the Petitcodiac River , including the Anagance and North rivers , is primarily made up of shale with volcanic rocks , mixed igneous rocks , and felsic pebble conglomerates . The southern shore , including the Little and Pollett rivers , is composed of Precambrian or Lower @-@ Palaeozoic sedimentary , igneous , and volcanic rocks , and limestone . Both shores include red to grey Mississippian sandstone . Red beds , or red @-@ tinted sedimentary rocks , have a higher occurrence around Port Elgin . Other significant Mississippian @-@ era rock patches appear in two areas around the watershed . The first is located near the north @-@ western border of the watershed , near Lutes Mountain and Cornhill . The second ranges from the east of the Memramcook River to the west of Hillsborough , in Beech Hill . The Petitcodiac River watershed also features karst topography , where gypsum and limestone around Mississippian rocks dilute into the circulating groundwater . This creates sinkholes , depressions , and caves . Examples of rare karst occurrences appear west of the village of Petitcodiac , where large sinkholes alternate between small ridges to form honeycomb @-@ shaped patterns . Hillsborough is the home of one of the longest gypsum cave networks in eastern Canada , and is a key habitat for bats in hibernation .",
  "Upon President 's return to port , the U.S. Navy launched an investigation into the incident . Gathering testimony from President 's officers and crewmen , they determined that Little Belt had fired the first shot in the encounter . In the Royal Navy investigation , Captain Bingham insisted that President had fired the first shot and continued firing for 45 minutes , rather than the five minutes Rodgers claimed . In all subsequent reports , both captains continually insisted that the other ship had fired the first shot . Reaching a stalemate , the American and British governments quietly dropped the matter .",

  "After the engine struggled with reliability issues throughout the first half of the season , Yasuhisa Arai declared himself happy with Honda 's progress following the British Grand Prix and announced that the development focus would switch to improving the performance of the RA615H ahead of the next round of planned updates at the Belgian Grand Prix , with plans for a wider range of updates spread out over the remainder of the season , with the Singapore Grand Prix earmarked as the first race that would be representative of the new engine 's performance . Honda predicted that the updated RA615H would produce enough horsepower to rival the Ferrari 059 / 4 engine . Despite being an average 13 @.@ 3 km / h ( 8 @.@ 3 mph ) slower than the fastest driver through the speed trap over the first half of the season , an analysis of the engine 's performance revealed that it had gradually reduced the deficit to the Renault Energy @-@ F1 2015 .

  "Hutchinson 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , colonial secretary Andrew Oliver , was given the job of \" stamp master \" , with responsibility for implementing the act in the province . Although Hutchinson apparently had no hand in this assignment , his opponents were quick to accuse him of further duplicity .

On 13 August 1765 , mobs descended on Oliver 's home and office , ransacking both . The next night Hutchinson 's Boston mansion was surrounded , and the crowd demanded that he formally deny arguing in favour of the Stamp Act in his correspondence with London . He refused , and only the intervention of a moderate leader prevented any action that night .",

  "Super Mario 64 DS was developed by Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS . It is a remake of the Nintendo 64 launch title Super Mario 64 , with the game 's 3D engine mirroring many visual effects used in the original game . Graphical changes include a higher polygon count for character models and the lack of texture filtering . Originally titled \" Super Mario 64 × 4 \" , it was first shown as a multiplayer demonstration at the 2004 E3 before the Nintendo DS was released . A few months later , Nintendo announced an actual game — along with many others — was in development . At the Nintendo DS conference on October 7 , 2004 , the game was on demonstration again and new information was revealed ; the name was changed to Super Mario 64 DS and four different characters ( Mario , Luigi , Yoshi , and Wario ) would be used in the main , single @-@ player adventure . The demonstration was a more complete version of the game than the E3 version — the game 's development was 90 % complete at this time — and highlighted the multiple characters in the single @-@ player mode and included minigames ; the multiplayer mode , however , was not present . Prior to the conference , the appearance of the box art on GameStop 's product page caused speculation the game would be a launch title . Nintendo confirmed the rumor by announcing at the conference that the game would be a launch title of the Nintendo DS in North America and Japan . As the game 's release approached , the release schedule of launch titles altered ; many titles were delayed , while others were announced to be released a few days before the Nintendo DS . Super Mario 64 DS was the only game scheduled to be released with the system . Koji Kondo provided the music for the game , while the voice actors from Super Mario 64 returned as well and this time , Kazumi Totaka joined the cast , playing the role of Yoshi .",
  "Wyatt Tee Walker wrote that the Birmingham campaign was \" legend \" and had become the Civil Rights Movement 's most important chapter . It was \" the chief watershed of the nonviolent movement in the United States . It marked the maturation of the SCLC as a national force in the civil rights arena of the land that had been dominated by the older and stodgier NAACP . \" Walker called the Birmingham campaign and the Selma marches \" Siamese twins \" joining to \" kill segregation ... and bury the body \" . Jonathan Bass declared that \" King had won a tremendous public relations victory in Birmingham \" but also stated pointedly that \" it was the citizens of the Magic City , both black and white , and not Martin Luther King and the SCLC , that brought about the real transformation of the city . \""
