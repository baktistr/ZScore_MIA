  "The program 's coaching extended beyond just within the program itself . Bowerman had his athletes mentor the community and continued to be active in the sport after his retirement . He was also a coach for the US Olympic team in 1972 and an assistant coach in 1968 US Olympic Team . Bill Dellinger coached the distance runners in the 1984 Olympic Games . After Dellinger retired from the University of Oregon , he continued to coach running on a consulting basis despite suffering through a stroke . Tom Heinonen remained a running coach after his retirement at the volunteer level for the University of Oregon Running Club . Alumnus Alberto Salazar became a noted marathon coach after his running days under the employ of Nike . Salazar used controversial coaching tactics like tweaking runners ' natural running form , but had coached many athletes to the apex of their careers . He launched an experimental training program called the Oregon Project financed by Nike with the purpose of integrating African runners ' training conditions into American training mixed with modern technology . He also discovered similarities in running posture between sprinters and top level distance runners , two disciplines previously thought to be exceedingly different . Instilling some of these methods into American runners , he was able to coach Kara Goucher to a third @-@ place finish in the Boston Marathon in 2009 , an event that East Africans typically dominate . Mo Farah and alumnus Galen Rupp were training partners under Salazar and finished first and second respectively in the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 10k . Rupp was the first American to medal in the 10k since Billy Mills in 1964 and the first medalist not born in Africa since 1988 . Similar to his collegiate coaches , Salazar wrote a pair of books about distance running . Matt Centrowitz , another University of Oregon alumnus , took the American University track and field program to prominence since the rebirth of the program in 1999 .",
  "Several interconnected themes run through Szabó ’ s films , the most common being the relationship between the personal and the political or historical . On the personal level , his first three feature films deal with coming of age issues , but political / historical events form the backdrop of these issues and continually rupture the attempts of the characters to lead their private lives . In an interview in 2008 , Szabó said , “ My mother once told me , ‘ We had a nice childhood and our youth was beautiful , but our life was destroyed by politics and history . ’ ” The political / historical events most commonly depicted are the dominant traumatic events of mid @-@ 20th century Hungarian and Central European history — Nazism , the Second World War , and , in Hungary — or , more accurately , Budapest — the Arrow Cross dictatorship and the Holocaust , the Communist takeover , and the 1956 Revolution . Szabó himself has frequently referred to this theme as the search for security .",
  "Mozambique was marked by large disparities between the wealthy Portuguese and the majority of the large rural indigenous African population . Poorer whites , many of them recent immigrants , including illiterate peasants , were given preference in lower @-@ level urban jobs , where a system of job reservation existed . In the rural areas , Portuguese controlled the trading stores with which African peasants interacted . Being largely illiterate and preserving their local traditions and ways of life , skilled employment opportunities and roles in administration and government were rare for these numerous tribal populations , leaving them few or no opportunities in the urban modern life . Many indigenous peoples saw their culture and tradition being overwhelmed by the alien culture of Portugal . A small educated African class did emerge , but faced substantial discrimination .",
  "Geologists believe that coast of western India came into being around 100 to 80 mya after it broke away from Madagascar . Soon after its detachment , the peninsular region of the Indian plate drifted over the Réunion hotspot , a volcanic hotspot in the Earth 's lithosphere near the island of Réunion . An eruption here some 66 mya is thought to have laid down the Deccan Traps , a vast bed of basalt lava that covers parts of central India . This volcanic activity resulted in the formation of basaltic outcrops , such as the Gilbert Hill , that are seen at various locations in the city . Further tectonic activity in the region led to the formation of hilly islands separated by a shallow sea . Pleistocene sediments found near Kandivali in northern Mumbai by British archaeologist Todd in 1939 indicate habitation since the Stone Age . The present day city was built on what was originally an archipelago of seven islands of Bombay Island , Parel , Mazagaon , Mahim , Colaba , Worli , and Old Woman 's Island ( also known as Little Colaba ) . The islands were coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard engineering project in 1784 . By 1000 BCE , the region was heavily involved in seaborne commerce with Egypt and Persia . The Koli fishing community had long inhabited the islands . They were Dravidian in origin and included a large number of scattered tribes along the Vindhya Plateau , Gujarat , and Konkan . In Mumbai , there were three or four of these tribes . Their religious practices could be summed up as animism .",

  "The Great Red Spot 's latitude has been stable for the duration of good observational records , typically varying by about a degree . Its longitude , however , is subject to constant variation . Because Jupiter 's visible features do not rotate uniformly at all latitudes , astronomers have defined three different systems for defining the longitude .

  "The wide range of instrumentation for forensic chemical analysis also started during this time period . In 1859 , chemist Robert Bunsen and physicist Gustav Kirchhoff invented the first spectroscope . Their experiments with spectroscopy showed that specific substances created a unique spectrum when exposed to a specific wavelength of light . Using spectroscopy , the two scientists were able to identify substances based on their spectrum , providing a method of identification for unknown materials . Another crucial advancement in the field was invented in 1906 by botanist Mikhail Tsvet : he developed paper chromatography , an early predecessor to thin layer chromatography , in order to separate and examine the plant proteins that make up chlorophyll . The ability to separate mixtures into their individual components allows forensic chemists to examine the parts of an unknown material against a database of known products . By matching the retention factors for the separated components with known values , materials can be identified . Over time , chromatography techniques have become more sophisticated with the introduction of liquid and gas chromatography .",

Writer Vince Gilligan came up with the concept for the episode when thinking about the series ' longest running storyline , the abduction of Samantha Mulder . Gilligan came up with a story questioning whether Samantha had not been abducted by aliens , but was rather murdered by a child killer instead .

Clicking on highlighted words in the article leads to more material describing the film , including Leonard 's notes and photographs as well as police reports . The filmmakers employed another tactic by sending out Polaroid pictures to random people , depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot on his chest . Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves , Christopher Nolan edited the film 's trailers himself . Sold to inexpensive cable @-@ TV channels like Bravo and A & E , and websites such as Yahoo and MSN , the trailers were key to the film gaining widespread public notice .",

The game 's first closed Alpha test began on March 11 , 2010 . It was available only to veteran players from XI . During alpha testing , the team used player feedback to find out key problems with the game , such as limitations on graphical adjustments making the game run at a slow frame rate . The open Beta test was originally scheduled to begin on August 31 , but was indefinitely postponed due to the discovery of critical bugs in the game . The Beta test eventually went live on September 2 , running until the game 's release later that month . It was later stated that more time should have been given to fixing bugs during the Beta period . The game released on September 30 , 2010 , six months prior to the PS3 version 's projected release date of March 2011 . A Collector 's Edition was released on September 22 , allowing owners to log in to the game from that date . The Collector 's Edition , which was decorated by artwork from Amano and Yoshida , came with bonus items including a DVD featuring a behind @-@ the @-@ scenes documentary , a security token , a case for the game 's box , and a decorated tumbler . The game was released with text in Japanese , English , French and German , while the spoken dialogue in cutscenes was English in all versions .",

  "The chick fledges between two and nine months after hatching , almost twice as long as a gull of the same body mass . The reasons behind the length of time are associated with the distance from the breeding site to food . First , there are few predators at the nesting colonies , therefore there is no pressure to fledge quickly . Second , the time between feedings is long due to the distance from the nest site that adults forage , thus a chick that had a higher growth rate would stand a better chance of starving to death . The duration between feedings vary among species and during the stages of development . Small feeds are frequent during the guard phase , but afterward become less frequent . However , each feed can deliver a large amount of energy ; both sooty shearwater and mottled petrel chicks have been recorded to double their weight in a single night , probably when fed by both parents .",

Suicide , like other immaterial social facts , exists independently of the will of an individual , cannot be eliminated , and is as influential – coercive – as physical laws such as gravity . Sociology 's task thus consists of discovering the qualities and characteristics of such social facts , which can be discovered through a quantitative or experimental approach ( Durkheim extensively relied on statistics ) .",
  "As a result of the war , the Ho @-@ Chunk tribe was compelled to cede the lead mining region to the United States . The Americans also increased their military presence on the frontier , building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts . The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together , and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward , a policy known as Indian removal . The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832 , which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues .",
  "During the 1970s , a number of diverse styles emerged in stark contrast to mainstream American popular music . Though these genres were not largely popular in the sense of selling many records to mainstream audiences , they were examples of popular music , as opposed to folk or classical music . In the early 1970s , African Americans and Puerto Ricans in New York City developed hip hop culture , which produced a style of music also called hip hop . At roughly the same time , Latinos , especially Cubans and Puerto Ricans , in New York also innovated salsa music , which combined many forms of Latin music with R & B and rock . The genres of punk rock and heavy metal were most closely associated with the United Kingdom in the 1970s , while various American derivatives evolved later in the decade and into the 1980s . Meanwhile , Detroit slowly evolved a series of electronic music genres like house and techno that later became a major part of popular music worldwide .",

  "While sailing to Shanghai Matsui adopted a plan drawn by the Japanese Navy to divide the SEA between two landing sites north of Shanghai , Wusong and Chuanshakou , and then use the former force to attack Shanghai directly and the latter force to encircle the Chinese Army . On August 23 Matsui oversaw the landing operation from aboard his flagship the Yura . The initial landings went well , but increasingly intense fighting ensued on land and casualties mounted . Matsui had never believed that he had been given enough soldiers to handle the job and was continuously pressing the high command for more reinforcements . He himself was not able to go ashore in Shanghai until September 10 , but that was the same day on which the Army General Staff informed him that three additional divisions would be deployed under his command . Still , even this infusion of new troops proved insufficient to dislodge the Chinese . He had mistakenly judged at the beginning of October that the Chinese Army was about to withdraw from Shanghai and had ordered concentrated infantry charges on the Chinese positions in the expectation that the campaign would be wrapped up before November . In fact the SEA was still battering Chinese defensive lines at Nanxiang and Suzhou Creek at that point . The turning point of the campaign did not come until November 5 when an entirely new army , the 10th Army led by Heisuke Yanagawa , landed south of Shanghai and forced the Chinese Army to make a hasty retreat .

  "Collection condoms are made from silicone or polyurethane , as latex is somewhat harmful to sperm .

Also , compared with samples obtained from masturbation , semen samples from collection condoms have higher total sperm counts , sperm motility , and percentage of sperm with normal morphology . For this reason , they are believed to give more accurate results when used for semen analysis , and to improve the chances of pregnancy when used in procedures such as intracervical or intrauterine insemination . Adherents of religions that prohibit contraception , such as Catholicism , may use collection condoms with holes pricked in them .",

Describing it as a metaphor , Madonna said that \" in Hollywood you can lose your memory and your vision of the future . You can lose everything because you can lose yourself . \" The beginning of the album cleared away what was not important for her , so Madonna could concentrate on the things that did matter . So , in contrast to the first three tracks , the later songs on American Life also deal with issues close to the singer 's heart , like talking about her relationship with her parents on the track \" Mother and Father \" . When Madonna was five , her mother died of breast cancer and the track was \" a way of letting go of the sadness and moving on . \" According to Lucy O 'Brien , author of Madonna : Like an Icon , another concept of American Life was about \" nothingness \" . This was evident in the titles of the songs like \" Nobody Knows Me \" , usage of \" no \" in \" Love Profusion \" , as well as \" Nothing Fails \" . Usage of the negative tone led Madonna to be sarcastic on people 's assumptions about her and emphasize about her knowledge of romantic love .

  "After 1551 , the Reformation advanced further , with the approval and encouragement of Edward , who began to exert more personal influence in his role as Supreme Head of the church . The new changes were also a response to criticism from such reformers as John Hooper , Bishop of Gloucester , and the Scot John Knox , who was employed as a minister in Newcastle under the Duke of Northumberland and whose preaching at court prompted the king to oppose kneeling at communion . Cranmer was also influenced by the views of the continental reformer Martin Bucer , who died in England in 1551 , by Peter Martyr , who was teaching at Oxford , and by other foreign theologians . The progress of the Reformation was further speeded by the consecration of more reformers as bishops . In the winter of 1551 – 52 , Cranmer rewrote the Book of Common Prayer in less ambiguous reformist terms , revised canon law , and prepared a doctrinal statement , the Forty @-@ two Articles , to clarify the practice of the reformed religion , particularly in the divisive matter of the communion service . Cranmer 's formulation of the reformed religion , finally divesting the communion service of any notion of the real presence of God in the bread and the wine , effectively abolished the mass .

  "In 1989 , HP determined that Reduced Instruction Set Computing ( RISC ) architectures were approaching a processing limit at one instruction per cycle . HP researchers investigated a new architecture , later named Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing ( EPIC ) , that allows the processor to execute multiple instructions in each clock cycle . EPIC implements a form of very long instruction word ( VLIW ) architecture , in which a single instruction word contains multiple instructions . With EPIC , the compiler determines in advance which instructions can be executed at the same time , so the microprocessor simply executes the instructions and does not need elaborate mechanisms to determine which instructions to execute in parallel . The goal of this approach is twofold : to enable deeper inspection of the code at compile time to identify additional opportunities for parallel execution , and to simplify processor design and reduce energy consumption by eliminating the need for runtime scheduling circuitry .",

On 17 November , while patrolling in the Baltic , Gazelle was attacked by the British submarine HMS E9 . The submarine fired a pair of torpedoes at the cruiser , but both missed . On the night of 25 – 26 January 1916 , she struck Russian mines to the north of Cape Arkona . The mine explosion tore off both of her screws and she had to be towed back to port . On 22 February , the German Navy decided the old cruiser was not worth repairing , and so she was placed out of service . She was converted into a hulk for minelayers , first at Danzig and then at Cuxhaven . In 1918 , she was moved to Wilhelmshaven . After the end of the war , Gazelle was formally stricken from the naval register on 28 August 1920 and broken up for scrap in Wilhelmshaven .",
  "Owing to the paucity of contemporaneous sources for Menkauhor , his relation to his predecessor , Nyuserre Ini , and to his successor , Djedkare Isesi , cannot be ascertained beyond doubt . Menkauhor may have been a son of Nyuserre Ini ; indeed Nyuserre Ini is known to have fathered a prince Khentykauhor as shown by a relief mentioning the prince from the mortuary complex of queen Khentkaus II , the mother of Nyuserre Ini . The similarity of Khentykauhor 's name to that of Menkauhor led the Egyptologists Miroslav Verner and Vivienne Callender to propose that the two are the same person , with Khentykauhor taking the name \" Menkauhor \" upon ascending the throne . This hypothesis is possibly contradicted by an inscription discovered in 2008 in the mastaba of Werkaure , the eldest son of an unnamed king . The inscription mentions a \" Menkauhor \" , but does not ascribe any royal attributes to him . The Egyptologists Hana Vymazalová and Filip Coppens suggest this might refer to the future pharaoh Menkauhor Kaiu at a time when he was still a prince . They note that Menkauhor might have offered high @-@ quality stone blocks for the construction of the tomb of his ( possible ) relative , which would explain the inscription . This contradicts the identification of Menkauhor with Khentykauhor ; Vymazalová and Coppens theorize that Khentykauhor and Menkauhor were brothers and sons of Nyuserre Ini .",

  "The first divine act is the creation of the cosmos , described in several creation myths . They focus on different gods , each of which may act as creator deities . The eight gods of the Ogdoad , who represent the chaos that precedes creation , give birth to the sun god , who establishes order in the newly formed world ; Ptah , who embodies thought and creativity , gives form to all things by envisioning and naming them ; Atum produces all things as emanations of himself ; and Amun , according to the myths promoted by his priesthood , preceded and created the other creator gods . These and other versions of the events of creation were not seen as contradictory . Each gives a different perspective on the complex process by which the organized universe and its many deities emerged from undifferentiated chaos . The period following creation , in which a series of gods rule as kings over the divine society , is the setting for most myths . The gods struggle against the forces of chaos and among each other before withdrawing from the human world and installing the historical kings of Egypt to rule in their place .",

  "Herbivores are dependent on plants for food , and have evolved mechanisms to obtain this food despite the evolution of a diverse arsenal of plant defenses . Herbivore adaptations to plant defense have been likened to offensive traits and consist of adaptations that allow increased feeding and use of a host plant . Relationships between herbivores and their host plants often results in reciprocal evolutionary change , called co @-@ evolution . When an herbivore eats a plant it selects for plants that can mount a defensive response . In cases where this relationship demonstrates specificity ( the evolution of each trait is due to the other ) , and reciprocity ( both traits must evolve ) , the species are thought to have co @-@ evolved . The \" escape and radiation \" mechanism for co @-@ evolution presents the idea that adaptations in herbivores and their host plants have been the driving force behind speciation , and have played a role in the radiation of insect species during the age of angiosperms . Some herbivores have evolved ways to hijack plant defenses to their own benefit , by sequestering these chemicals and using them to protect themselves from predators . Plant defenses against herbivores are generally not complete so plants also tend to evolve some tolerance to herbivory .",

  "Andrew Crowther places Trial by Jury at the centre of Gilbert 's development as a librettist . He notes that in some of Gilbert 's early libretti , such as Topsyturveydom ( 1874 ) , the songs simply emphasise the dialogue . In others , such as Thespis ( 1871 ) , some songs are relatively disconnected from both the story and characterisation , such as \" I once knew a chap \" or \" Little maid of Arcadee \" , which simply convey a moral lesson . In Trial by Jury , however , each song carries the plot forward and adds depth to the characters . In addition , unlike some of Gilbert 's more fantastical early plots , \" Aside from the ending , nothing essentially improbable happens . \" Theatre historian Kurt Gänzl agrees , writing that \" Gilbert 's libretto was superior to any of his previous efforts . It was concise , modern and satirical without being impossibly whimsical . Having no spoken dialogue it was perforce tightly constructed and allowed of no interpolation or alteration . \" Sullivan 's development as a comic opera writer , too , would mature with Trial by Jury . Except for incidental music for productions of Shakespeare , he had not written any music for the stage since Thespis . Gänzl wrote that Trial by Jury \" brought Sullivan firmly and finally into the world of the musical \" stage and confirmed , after his previous success with Cox and Box and Thespis , that \" Sullivan was a composer of light lyric and comic music who could rival Offenbach , Lecocq and any English musician alive . \"",

Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park , and without formal policy or regulations , he had few legal methods to enforce such protection .

  "In contrast to his 1850 measurement , Foucault 's 1862 measurement was aimed at obtaining an accurate absolute value for the speed of light , since his concern was to deduce an improved value for the astronomical unit .

The balloon was recovered and filming continued for a third day , but as the early photographs of the power station were considered better , the image of the pig was later superimposed onto one of those .",
  "American scientists thought the missing body to be Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity , such as an immature collarbone , undescended wisdom teeth , or immature vertebrae in the back , that they would have expected to find in the seventeen @-@ year @-@ old Anastasia . In 1998 , when the bodies of the Imperial Family were finally interred , a body measuring approximately 5 feet 7 inches was buried under the name of Anastasia . Photographs taken of the four sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Maria was several inches taller than Anastasia and was also taller than her sister Olga . However , the heights of the skeletons had to be estimated because some of the bones had been cut and portions of the skeletons were missing . Since teeth and large portions of the jaw were missing in several of the skeletons , the Russian scientists ' assertion that Anastasia 's remains rather than those of Maria were in the grave because none of the skeletons had a gap between the front teeth also appeared questionable to American scientists .",

  "The constitutionality of the new law was disputed .

  "Shakespeare borrowed the character of Banquo from Holinshed 's Chronicles , a history of Britain published by Raphael Holinshed in 1587 . In Chronicles Banquo is an accomplice to Macbeth in the murder of the king , rather than a loyal subject of the king who is seen as an enemy by Macbeth .

Over his two terms , his economic policies saw a reduction of inflation from 12 @.@ 5 % to 4 @.@ 4 % , and an average annual growth of real GDP of 3 @.@ 4 % ; while Reagan did enact cuts in domestic discretionary spending , increased military spending contributed to increased federal outlays overall , even after adjustment for inflation . During his reelection bid , Reagan campaigned on the notion that it was \" Morning in America \" , winning a landslide in 1984 with the largest electoral college victory in history . Foreign affairs dominated his second term , including ending of the Cold War , the bombing of Libya , and the Iran – Contra affair . Publicly describing the Soviet Union as an \" evil empire \" , he transitioned Cold War policy from détente to rollback , by escalating an arms race with the USSR while engaging in talks with Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev , which culminated in the INF Treaty , shrinking both countries ' nuclear arsenals . During his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate , President Reagan challenged Gorbachev to \" tear down this wall ! \" . Five months after the end of his term , the Berlin Wall fell , and on December 26 , 1991 , nearly three years after he left office , the Soviet Union collapsed .",

Antbirds have evolved a more complicated system than the strict territoriality of most other birds .

  "Since plasmas are very good electrical conductors , electric potentials play an important role . The potential as it exists on average in the space between charged particles , independent of the question of how it can be measured , is called the \" plasma potential \" , or the \" space potential \" . If an electrode is inserted into a plasma , its potential will generally lie considerably below the plasma potential due to what is termed a Debye sheath . The good electrical conductivity of plasmas makes their electric fields very small . This results in the important concept of \" quasineutrality \" , which says the density of negative charges is approximately equal to the density of positive charges over large volumes of the plasma ( <formula> ) , but on the scale of the Debye length there can be charge imbalance . In the special case that double layers are formed , the charge separation can extend some tens of Debye lengths .",

  "With a Category 4 hurricane forecast to track directly over the Leeward Islands , hurricane warnings were issued for several islands by September 4 . The ridge located north of Luis began to weaken by this time , leading to slower forward movement to 12 mph ( 19 km / h ) . Outflow to the north of the hurricane weakened slightly as a distinct area of dry air developed around the weakening ridge . Late on September 4 , the hurricane 's eye began to shrink , a possible indication of strengthening . An area of low pressure over Florida cut off from a trough would eventually cause Luis to slow significantly and cause a northward turn . On September 5 , Hurricane Luis weakened slightly , with winds decreasing to 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) , before tracking directly over Barbuda . The eyewall of the storm brushed Antigua , St. Barthelemy , St. Martin and Anguilla . Sustained winds on these islands were recorded up to 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) with gusts up to 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) . The eye of Luis was estimated to be 46 mi ( 74 km ) in diameter at this time . Operationally , the NHC briefly downgraded Luis to a Category 3 hurricane as it passed through the islands due to the formation of concentric eyewalls ; however , in post @-@ season analysis , it was determined that the storm never weakened below Category 4 status while passing through the Leeward Islands .",

There are only two centers in the world that are authorized by the WHO to keep stocks of smallpox virus : the Vector Institute in Russia and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States .

  "Female loggerheads first reproduce between the ages of 17 and 33 , and their mating period may last more than six weeks . They court their mates , but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined . Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling , biting , and head and flipper movements . Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability . Before mating , the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her , while she resists . Next , the male and female begin to circle each other . If the male has competitors , the female may let the males struggle with each other . The winner then mounts the female ; the male 's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female 's shell during this process . Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate , damaging his flippers and tail , possibly exposing bones . Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal .

He joined a team of Russian NHL players organized by Slava Fetisov that returned to Russia to play a five @-@ game charity tour against local clubs . On the team , Bure was reunited with former Central Red Army linemates Mogilny and Fedorov .

However , there were unresolved contract issues , as Salcer claimed that the Canucks promised they would pay Bure 's full salary despite the lockout , which cancelled nearly half of the 1994 – 95 season . Bure held out for four days as a result ( the amount claimed to be owing was US $ 1 @.@ 7 million ) , before the two sides reached an agreement that the Canucks would put the disputed amount in escrow and would continue discussions .

  "According to the author Raymond Benson , Moonraker is a deeper and more introspective book than Fleming 's previous work , which allows the author to develop the characters further . As such , Bond \" becomes something more than ... [ the ] cardboard figure \" that he had been in the previous two novels . The start of the book concentrates on Bond at home and his daily routines , which Fleming describes as \" Elastic office hours from around ten until six , ... evenings spent playing cards in the company of a few close friends , ... or making love , with rather cold passion , to one of three similarly disposed married women . \" This lifestyle was largely modelled on Fleming 's own , which the journalist and writer Matthew Parker sees as showing \" a sourness \" in the author 's character .

  "Austen 's life during the Regency era enmeshed her in the debate about slavery . She omits any mention of the Slave Trade Act 1807 , which abolished the slave trade ( not slavery itself ) in the British Empire . The act ( passed four years before Austen began the novel ) was the culmination of a long campaign by abolitionists , notably William Wilberforce . Slavery was not abolished in the empire until 1833 ; the death rate on the Caribbean plantations was high due to yellow fever and malaria , and abolitionists thought that abolishing the slave trade would end slavery in the West Indies ( since plantation owners would be unable to import slaves from Africa ) . Literary theoretician Edward Said implicated Mansfield Park in the acceptance by Western culture of the benefits of slavery and imperialism ( a connection also made by Vladimir Nabokov in his Lectures on Literature , delivered in the 1940s but unpublished until 1980 ) , citing Austen 's failure to note that the Mansfield Park estate was possible only with slave labour . Said depicted Austen as a racist supporter of slavery whose books should be condemned , not celebrated . His thesis that she wrote Mansfield Park to glorify slavery received wide attention ; the editor of a Penguin edition of the novel wrote in its introduction that Said had called Mansfield Park \" part of the structure of an expanding imperialist venture \" . Literary critics ( including Gabrielle White ) have rejected Said 's condemnation of Austen and Western culture , maintaining that she and other writers — including Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke — opposed slavery and helped make its eventual abolition possible .

The first installment of the manga was published in the February issue of Shōnen Ace in December 1994 with subsequent installments produced on an irregular basis over an eighteen @-@ year period . The final installment was published in June 2013 . Several publishers were initially concerned at the selection of Sadamoto to develop the manga adaptation , viewing him as \" too passé to be bankable \" . These concerns proved unfounded upon the strong commercial success of the manga : the first 10 volumes sold over 15 million copies , and the eleventh volume reached number one on the Tohan charts , selling an additional two million copies .

  "The Army of the Potomac , having constructed pontoon bridges across the Rappahannock , commenced the Battle of Fredericksburg on the morning of December 13 , 1862 . The Confederate army occupied the city of Fredericksburg and a high ridge behind the city known as Marye 's Heights . By late morning , Union forces had taken the city and began the assault on Marye 's Heights . At approximately 3 : 30 in the afternoon the 22nd Massachusetts , with the rest of Colonel James Barnes 's brigade , crossed one of the pontoon bridges and moved through a railroad cut to the outskirts of the city . The regiment numbered about 200 men . Barnes 's brigade was ordered to relieve a brigade of the IX Corps which had made a charge on the stone wall along Marye 's Heights and become pinned down by Confederate fire . By the time they formed up battle lines on the open slope in front of Marye 's Heights , the 22nd was under intense artillery fire from the Confederates . According to the regimental historian , \" the men instinctively turned their sides to the storm \" of bullets , shot and shell as they advanced and casualties were heavy . Their brigade reached Nagle 's brigade and the 22nd relieved the 12th Rhode Island , taking shelter on ground covered by that regiment 's casualties .

  "The formation of giant planets is an outstanding problem in the planetary sciences . In the framework of the solar nebular model two theories for their formation exist . The first one is the disk instability model , where giant planets form in the massive protoplanetary disks as a result of its gravitational fragmentation ( see above ) . The second possibility is the core accretion model , which is also known as the nucleated instability model . The latter scenario is thought to be the most promising one , because it can explain the formation of the giant planets in relatively low @-@ mass disks ( less than 0 @.@ 1 M ☉ ) . In this model giant planet formation is divided into two stages : a ) accretion of a core of approximately 10 M ⊕ and b ) accretion of gas from the protoplanetary disk .

  "Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues , Herrerasaurus has at times been considered basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia , although Brinkmann and Sues still considered it to be inside Dinosauria . They supported this on the basis that Herrerasaurus has a large pedal digit V , and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum . Brinkmann and Sues considered Staurikosaurus and Herrerasaurus to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae , and that instead they were successively more primitive forms . Also , they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid , instead representing only the plesiomorphic state that was found in both taxa . This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas , who stated many derived synapomorphies of Herrerasauridae , such as a distinct pubic boot , but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia .

  "One of the Orb 's most notable contributions to electronic music is their idea of blurring the distinction between sampling and remixing . Albums such as Pomme Fritz , though released as a piece of original work , consist largely of manipulated samples . Conversely , the Orb 's remixes typically use only small sections of the original track , most notably in the case of their single \" Toxygene \" . \" Toxygene \" was originally commissioned as a remix of Jean Michel Jarre 's \" Oxygene 8 \" from Oxygene 7 @-@ 13 . The Orb \" obliterated it \" and reassembled only a few fragments for their remix , much to the chagrin of Jarre , who reportedly refused to release it ; The Orb released the track themselves under the name \" Toxygene \" , which further irritated Jarre , to whom Paterson retorted \" The French are always five years behind us , anyway . \" In statements made after the release of \" Toxygene \" , Jarre denied that he rejected the original remix because of disliking it .",

  "Lions tend to dominate smaller felines such as cheetahs and leopards where they co @-@ occur , stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance . The cheetah has a 50 % chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators . Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs , up to 90 % of which are lost in their first weeks of life due to attacks by other predators . Cheetahs avoid competition by hunting at different times of the day and hide their cubs in thick brush . Leopards also use such tactics , but have the advantage of being able to subsist much better on small prey than either lions or cheetahs . Also , unlike cheetahs , leopards can climb trees and use them to keep their cubs and kills away from lions ; however , lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills . Similarly , lions dominate African wild dogs , not only taking their kills but also preying on young and ( rarely ) adult dogs . Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant . However , there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs .",

These treatments are recommended in severe overdoses . In addition , due to metformin 's low molecular weight and lack of plasma protein binding , these techniques also have the benefit of removing metformin from blood plasma , preventing further lactate overproduction .",

  "According to folklore , brachial gland secretions are generally thought to contain venom because of apparent anaphylactic reactions by humans following their bites . Slow lorises can indeed inflict painful bites . Animal dealers in Southeast Asia keep tanks of water nearby so that in case of a bite , they can submerge both their arm and the slow loris to make the animal let go . The secretion from the brachial gland of captive slow lorises is similar to the allergen in cat dander , hence the secretions may merely elicit an allergic reaction , not toxicosis . Loris bites cause a painful swelling , and the single case of human death reported in the scientific literature was believed to have resulted from anaphylactic shock . However , although the toxin is only produced when the brachial secretion and saliva are mixed , both the secretion and saliva may have unique chemical properties and may act separately . Furthermore , secondary toxins may be introduced from the consumption of wild food , augmenting the toxicity . The combined brachial secretion and saliva of recently captured wild lorises was shown to contain batrachotoxins , which were not found in slow lorises held in captivity for more than a year .",

Nevertheless , in the memoirs of contemporaries such as Lord Hervey and Horace Walpole , George is depicted as a weak buffoon , governed by his wife and ministers .

As a result , these first releases were followed by further distributions across much of the region , although their effectiveness on other crops , such as cabbages , has been questioned ; when the toads were released at Wau , the cabbages provided insufficient shelter and the toads rapidly left the immediate area for the superior shelter offered by the forest . A similar situation had previously arisen in the Australian cane fields , but this experience was either unknown or ignored in New Guinea . The cane toad has since become abundant in rural and urban areas .",

  "The construction of the dyke suggests that it was built to create an effective barrier and to command views into Wales .

This force would later be instrumental , providing intelligence to the liberating forces led by General Douglas MacArthur , and took an active role in numerous battles , such as the Raid at Los Baños . When war broke out in the Philippines , some 300 Philippine Military Academy and ROTC cadets , unable to join the USAFFE units because of their youth , banded together in a common desire to contribute to the war effort throughout the Bataan campaign . The Hunters originally conducted operations with another guerrilla group called Marking 's Guerrillas , with whom they went about liquidating Japanese spies .

  "According to a story by Procopius , it was not until 552 CE that the Byzantine emperor Justinian obtained the first silkworm eggs . He had sent two Nestorian monks to Central Asia , and they were able to smuggle silkworm eggs to him hidden in rods of bamboo . While under the monks ' care , the eggs hatched , though they did not cocoon before arrival . The Byzantine church was thus able to make fabrics for the emperor , with the intention of developing a large silk industry in the Eastern Roman Empire , using techniques learned from the Sassanids . These gynecia had a legal monopoly on the fabric , but the empire continued to import silk from other major urban centres on the Mediterranean . The magnificence of the Byzantine techniques was not a result of the manufacturing process , but instead of the meticulous attention paid to the execution and decorations . The weaving techniques they used were taken from Egypt . The first diagrams of semple looms appeared in the 5th century .",

The Vedaranyam swamp is located parallel to the Palk Strait for 48 km ( 30 mi ) . The river Cauvery was flowing south easterly direction from Trichy and had its confluence at Vedaranyam due to the emergence of Vedaranyam nose ( the nose shaped stretch from Vedaranyam to Kodiyakarai ) during the pleistocene period . Due to the rise of teritiary rocks in the Pattukottai – Mannargudi region and also due to the increase of sediments in the Vedaranyam area , the river migrated northwards . There is lesser marine activity in the Vedaranyam shore due to the presence of Vedaranyam nose in the north and Sri Lanka in the south , both causing weak shore currents .",

  "Dawkins became a prominent critic of religion and has stated his opposition to religion as twofold : religion is both a source of conflict and a justification for belief without evidence . He considers faith — belief that is not based on evidence — as \" one of the world 's great evils \" . He rose to prominence in public debates relating science and religion since the publication of his most popular book The God Delusion in 2006 , which became an international best seller . As of 2015 , more than three million copies were sold and the book has been translated into over 30 languages . Its success has been seen by many as indicative of a change in the contemporary cultural zeitgeist and has also been identified with the rise of New Atheism . In the book , Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion — \" a fixed false belief \" . In his February 2002 TED talk entitled \" Militant atheism \" , Dawkins urged all atheists to openly state their position and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science . On September 30 , 2007 , Dawkins , Christopher Hitchens , Sam Harris , and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens ' residence for a private , unmoderated discussion that lasted two hours .

  "Edward I was a tall man for his era , hence the nickname \" Longshanks \" . He was temperamental , and this , along with his height , made him an intimidating man , and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries . Nevertheless , he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship , as a soldier , an administrator and a man of faith . Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward I : while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration , others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility . Currently , Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign , including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III , establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes , and reforming the law through statutes . At the same time , he is also often criticised for other actions , such as his brutal conduct towards the Scots , and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290 , by which the Jews were expelled from England . The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages , and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1656 .",

That relief force won a surprising victory over the more experienced Spartan force in the Battle of Arginusae , but in the wake of that battle Theramenes found himself in the middle of a massive controversy . At the end of the battle , the generals in command of the fleet had conferred to decide on their next steps . Several pressing concerns presented themselves ; 50 Peloponnesian ships under Eteonicus remained at Mytilene , blockading Conon , and decisive action by the Athenians could lead to the destruction of that force as well , but , at the same time , ships needed to be dispatched to recover the sailors of the twenty five Athenian triremes sunk or disabled in the battle . Accordingly , all eight generals , with the larger part of the fleet , set out for Mytilene , while a rescue force under Thrasybulus and Theramenes , both of whom were trierarchs in this battle but had served as generals in prior campaigns , remained behind to pick up the survivors and retrieve corpses for burial .

  "Desbouvrie kept his swallows in a cage and trained them to fly in and out of the cage . Another challenge he overcame was the birds ' natural migratory behavior . Desbouvrie believed that swallows migrated southward because the supply of insects for them to feed upon dwindled in winter . Desbouvrie refused to make public disclosure of what he fed the birds in wintertime and regarded that as a trade secret . Later attempts to train homing behavior into migratory birds determined that the birds have no instinctive knowledge of where to fly when the season changes , so if the normal migratory pattern is disrupted during the first year of life the individual does not migrate afterward .",

  "Altered dopamine neurotransmission is implicated in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , a condition associated with impaired cognitive control , in turn leading to problems with regulating attention ( attentional control ) , inhibiting behaviors ( inhibitory control ) , and forgetting things or missing details ( working memory ) , among other problems . There are genetic links between dopamine receptors , the dopamine transporter , and ADHD , in addition to links to other neurotransmitter receptors and transporters .

A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor Louis Le Prince , the concept was copied by U.S. inventor Thomas Edison in 1889 , and subsequently developed by his employee William Kennedy Laurie Dickson between 1889 and 1892 . Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph , an innovative motion picture camera with rapid intermittent , or stop @-@ and @-@ go , film movement , to photograph movies for in @-@ house experiments and , eventually , commercial Kinetoscope presentations .",
  "Increases in the number of CAT operations , and in the number of airports they operate from , has resulted in a corresponding increase in Class A controlled airspace .

  "In 1949 , E.V. Ramasamy 's chief lieutenant , Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai , established a separate association called the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam ( DMK ) , or Dravidian Advancement Association . This was due to differences between the two , while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state , Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government , at the same time claiming increased state independence . E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub @-@ continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal . Thus , if they contest elections aiming to assume political power , they would lose vigour and sense of purpose . But among his followers , there were those who had a different view , wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government . They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy . Thus , when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948 , they quit the Dravidar Kazhagam , stating that E.V. Ramasamy set a bad example by marrying a young woman that took his foster child in his old age – he was 70 and she 30 . Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK . Though the DMK split from the Dravidar Kazhagam , the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy 's Self @-@ Respect Movement to villagers and urban students . The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than Sanskrit and Hindi in content , and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned .

  "One difference that places fungi in a different kingdom is that its cell walls contain chitin , unlike the cell walls of plants , bacteria and some protists . Similar to animals , fungi are heterotrophs , that is , they acquire their food by absorbing dissolved molecules , typically by secreting digestive enzymes into their environment . Growth is their means of mobility , except for spores , which may travel through the air or water ( a few of which are flagellated ) . Fungi are the principal decomposers in ecological systems . These and other differences place fungi in a single group of related organisms , named the Eumycota ( true fungi or Eumycetes ) , that share a common ancestor ( is a monophyletic group ) , an interpretation that is also strongly supported by molecular phylogenetics . This fungal group is distinct from the structurally similar myxomycetes ( slime molds ) and oomycetes ( water molds ) . The discipline of biology devoted to the study of fungi is known as mycology ( from the Greek μύκης , mukēs , meaning \" fungus \" ) . In the past , mycology was regarded as a branch of botany ; today it is a separate kingdom in biological taxonomy . Fungi are genetically more closely related to animals than to plants .",

According to Daily , the series ' ending allowed the writers more artistic freedom while developing storylines . \" You get to do story lines that you wouldn 't otherwise do because you don 't have to worry about the ramifications , \" he explained . \" So people can move , people can die , people can have babies and you don 't have to worry about the babies growing up . \" The episode introduced Bree 's blackmail storyline , which recalls the first season 's mystery storyline surrounding series narrator Mary Alice 's suicide . Daily stated that the similarity between the storylines was intentional : \" We ’ re kind of just diving into the DNA of the series a little bit . Are there any unanswered questions floating around out there ? Any characters we need to check in with one more time ? \" Cherry noted that the \" mystery hearkens back to the first season , going back to the roots of Mary Alice [ Brenda Strong ] . This feels right for that mystery to take us out this year . \" Brenda Strong commented that \" It ’ s the smartest way to end the series , to finish where you began . I think it really cements it in the psyche of the audience and gives them a sense of completion . \"",

  "Scientists and conservationists ( most importantly BirdLife International and their partners , who run the Save the Albatross campaign ) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face . Techniques such as setting longline bait at night , dyeing the bait blue , setting the bait underwater , increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch . For example , a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species . The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black @-@ browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years . Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration , removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife , which protects albatrosses from introduced predators .",

  "The song received generally positive reviews from critics . AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine considered Here We Go Again \" not quite as much fun \" , as Lovato 's debut album Don 't Forget , \" but still fun , particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like ... ' Remember December ' . \" Erlewine also named the song one of the best tracks on the album . BBC Music 's Fraser McAlpine rated it four out of five stars , and wrote , \" I 'm sure there 's a punkrock reason why we should all get together and hate it , but for the life of me I just can 't . Even with the weird pronunciation and silly lyrics , this is a corker . \" McAlpine praised the \" grand \" chorus and wrote : \" Someone in Team Lovato has been cocking an ear to the musical stylings of Paramore and maybe suggested that the next logical step after Camp Rock 's wholesome Disneyfication of popular song might be something a little more confessional . \"",
