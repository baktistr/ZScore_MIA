William of Malmesbury says that Ealdred , by \" amusing the simplicity of King Edward and alleging the custom of his predecessors , had acquired , more by bribery than by reason , the archbishopric of York while still holding his former see . \" On his arrival in Rome , however , charges of simony , or the buying of ecclesiastical office , and lack of learning were brought against him , and his elevation to York was refused by Pope Nicholas II , who also deposed him from Worcester . The story of Ealdred being deposed comes from the Vita Edwardi , a life of Edward the Confessor , but the Vita Wulfstani , an account of the life of Ealdred 's successor at Worcester , Wulfstan , says that Nicholas refused the pallium until a promise to find a replacement for Worcester was given by Ealdred .

However , as Carpenter has noted , the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae , movement would be limited . Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily , by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs , allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack .

  "In 1988 , development of a new NES Zelda began , but one year later , the project was brought to Nintendo 's next console ; the Super Famicom in Japan , the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in other regions . Due to the success of previous titles in the series , Nintendo was able to invest a large budget and ample development time and resources into the game 's production . At the time , most SNES game cartridges had 4 Mbit ( 512 KB ) of storage space . This game broke the trend by using 8 Mbit ( 1 MB ) , allowing the Nintendo development team to create a remarkably expansive world for Link to inhabit . Like Super Mario World , this game used a simple graphic compression method on the SNES by limiting the color depth of many tiles to eight colors instead of the SNES 's native 16 @-@ color tiles . The tiles were decompressed at runtime by adding a leading bit to each pixel 's color index . Storage space was also saved by eliminating duplication : The Light World and the Dark World are almost identical in layout ( though using differing texture tiles ) , and the Dark World exists in the game 's ROM only as an \" overlay \" of the Light World .",

  "Wind figures prominently in several popular sports , including recreational hang gliding , hot air ballooning , kite flying , snowkiting , kite landboarding , kite surfing , paragliding , sailing , and windsurfing . In gliding , wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider . Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches , also known as winch launches or wire launches . If the wind gradient is significant or sudden , or both , and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude , the indicated airspeed will increase , possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed . The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient . When landing , wind shear is also a hazard , particularly when the winds are strong . As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing , airspeed decreases while sink rate increases , and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact . The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it .",

  "The popular view of Richard has more than anything been influenced by Shakespeare 's play about the king , Richard II . Shakespeare 's Richard was a cruel , vindictive and irresponsible king , who attained a semblance of greatness only after his fall from power . Writing a work of fiction , however , Shakespeare took many liberties and made great omissions . Shakespeare based his play on works by writers such as Edward Hall and Samuel Daniel , who in turn based their writings on contemporary chroniclers such as Thomas Walsingham . Hall and Daniel were part of Tudor historiography , which was highly unsympathetic to Richard . The Tudor orthodoxy , reinforced by Shakespeare , saw a continuity in civil discord starting with Richard 's misrule that did not end until Henry VII 's accession in 1485 . The idea that Richard was to blame for the later @-@ 15th century Wars of the Roses was prevalent as late as the 19th century , but came to be challenged in the twentieth .

  "Different areas of the brain exhibit different forms of LTP . The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors . One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is observed . For example , the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus . The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present . For example , some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor , others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mGluR ) , while still others depend upon another molecule altogether . The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is observed . For example , LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor @-@ dependent , whereas LTP in the mossy fiber pathway is NMDA receptor @-@ independent .",

This tank @-@ gun fire caught the DPRK troops unprepared while they were hiding from the artillery fire . Trapped between the two barrages , they started to vacate their positions . An American infantry attack next reached the crest of the Triangulation Hill without much trouble , and this battle was over by about 16 : 00 . American artillery and mortar fire was now shifted westward , and this cut off the retreat of the DPRK troops . White phosphorus shells fired from the 61st Field Artillery Battalion caught North Korean troops in a village while they attempted to retreat , and the DPRK troops were then routed by American infantry , suffering over 200 killed . That evening the 1st Battalion , 7th Cavalry , returned to the serve as the division reserve , and elements of the 5th Cavalry finished securing Hill 268 .",

  "A fresh series of conflicts began in the 2nd century AD , during which the Romans consistently held the upper hand over Parthia . The Emperor Trajan invaded Armenia and Mesopotamia during 114 and 115 and annexed them as Roman provinces . He captured the Parthian capital , Ctesiphon , before sailing downriver to the Persian Gulf . However , uprisings erupted in 115 AD in the occupied Parthian territories , while a major Jewish revolt broke out in Roman territory , severely stretching Roman military resources . Parthian forces attacked key Roman positions , and the Roman garrisons at Seleucia , Nisibis and Edessa were expelled by the local inhabitants . Trajan subdued the rebels in Mesopotamia , but having installed the Parthian prince Parthamaspates on the throne as a client ruler , he withdrew his armies and returned to Syria . Trajan died in 117 , before he was able to reorganize and consolidate Roman control over the Parthian provinces .",

  "The wild parsnip from which the modern cultivated varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places , particularly on chalk and limestone soils . Parsnips are biennials , but are normally grown as annuals . Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt , clay , and stony ground ; the latter produces short , forked roots . Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long . Seeds are usually planted in early spring , as soon as the ground can be worked to a fine tilth , in the position where the plants are to grow . The growing plants are thinned and kept weed @-@ free . Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost , and continues through winter . The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather . Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars , giving them a sweeter taste .",

  "The problem was that the beams interfered with each other , producing a series of oscillations called hash . An arrangement was devised that minimized the interference , resulting in reasonably good beams being produced in September 1942 .

These were sheets of iron about 3 feet ( 1 m ) in width that were bolted to the top and bottom of the vacuum tank .

Sowerby also contends that James 's policies of religious toleration attracted substantial support from religious nonconformists , including Quakers , Baptists , Congregationalists and Presbyterians , who were attracted by the king 's push for a new \" Magna Carta for liberty of conscience \" . The king was overthrown , in Sowerby 's view , largely because of fears among the Dutch and English elites that James might be aligning himself with Louis XIV in a supposed \" holy league \" to destroy Protestantism across northern Europe . Sowerby presents James 's reign as a struggle between those who believed that the king was sincerely devoted to liberty of conscience and those who were sceptical of the king 's espousals of toleration and believed that he had a hidden agenda to overthrow English Protestantism .",

  "A weak surface low formed west of Truk on October 3 , which contained little thunderstorm activity . Moving northwest , it joined the eastern section of the monsoon trough . Following the flow around the east side of the trough towards the north , poorly organized convection became associated with the persistent low . Once it neared the northeast fringe of the trough , convective organization improved . Although still a very broad system , it became a tropical depression on the morning of October 7 . Moving around the southwest part of a retreating subtropical ridge , Ogden sharply recurved . By early October 8 , it strengthened into a tropical storm and passed just east of Marcus Island . The cyclone attained typhoon intensity partially due to translational motion as it began to undergo extratropical transition on October 9 . Southwest shear began to significantly impact the system thereafter , which weakened the system into a tropical storm on October 10 . By noon , the system had fully evolved into an extratropical cyclone . The nontropical storm continued northeast towards the International Dateline .",

  "The Association for Asian Studies states that there is no known written evidence to suggest that later leaders of the Gelug — Gendün Drup ( 1391 – 1474 ) and Gendün Gyatso ( 1475 – 1571 ) — had any contacts with Ming China . These two religious leaders were preoccupied with an overriding concern for dealing with the powerful secular Rinpungpa princes , who were patrons and protectors of the Karma Kargyu lamas . The Rinpungpa leaders were relatives of the Phagmodrupa , yet their authority shifted over time from simple governors to rulers in their own right over large areas of Ü @-@ Tsang .

While the task of New Years prayers in Lhasa was granted to the Karmapa and others , Gendün Gyatso traveled in exile looking for allies . However , it was not until 1518 that the secular Phagmodru ruler captured Lhasa from the Rinbung , and thereafter the Gelug was given rights to conduct the New Years prayer .

  "Although there is some debate within Islam over whether it is a religious requirement , circumcision ( called khitan ) is practiced nearly universally by Muslim males . Islam bases its practice of circumcision on the Genesis 17 narrative , the same Biblical chapter referred to by Jews .

There is no agreement across the many Islamic communities about the age at which circumcision should be performed .

  "The Maryland colony was founded by Cecil Calvert in 1634 . Like his father George Calvert , who had originated the efforts that led to the colony 's charter , Cecil Calvert was Catholic at a time when England was dominated by the Anglican Church . The Calverts intended the colony as a haven for Catholics fleeing England and as a source of income for themselves and their descendants . Many of Maryland 's first settlers were Catholic , including at least two Catholic priests , one of whom became the earliest chronicler of the colony 's history . But whatever Calvert 's intentions , Maryland was a colony of an Anglican nation . Its charter had been granted by an Anglican king and seems to have assumed that the Church of England would be its official church . Anglican and later Puritan newcomers quickly came to outnumber the early Catholic settlers . Thus , by 1649 when the law was passed , the colonial assembly was dominated by Protestants , and the law was in effect an act of Protestant tolerance for Catholics , rather than the reverse .",

  "The significance of the concept of a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics . In short , the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space , the observables are hermitian operators on that space , the symmetries of the system are unitary operators , and measurements are orthogonal projections . The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus for the development of the unitary representation theory of groups , initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl . On the other hand , in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space ( Koopman – von Neumann classical mechanics ) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory .",

The other mechanism is the nonlexical or sublexical route , which is the process whereby the reader can \" sound out \" a written word .

However , the British still had to consider the threat of a German invasion due the possibility that the Soviet Union could collapse under the German onslaught and the ease in which Germany could transfer troops back to the west . In late 1941 , the arrival of autumn and winter weather meant that the threat of invasion subsided .

On 29 January , he took a ship bound for Ceylon , hoping that he would be able to finish his novel . Within a few days , he was writing home complaining of \" other passengers whispering about me \" and of hearing voices , including that of his recent BBC interlocutor , Stephen Black . He left the ship in Egypt and flew on to Colombo , but , he wrote to Laura , the voices followed him . Alarmed , Laura sought help from her friend , Frances Donaldson , whose husband agreed to fly out to Ceylon and bring Waugh home .

  "Bacteria have developed ways to survive inside phagocytes , where they continue to evade the immune system . To get safely inside the phagocyte they express proteins called \" invasins \" . When inside the cell they remain in the cytoplasm and avoid toxic chemicals contained in the phagolysosomes . Some bacteria prevent the fusion of a phagosome and lysosome , to form the phagolysosome . Other pathogens , such as Leishmania , create a highly modified vacuole inside the phagocyte , which helps them persist and replicate . Some bacteria are capable of living inside of the phagolysosome . Staphylococcus aureus , for example , produces the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase , which break down chemicals — such as hydrogen peroxide — produced by phagocytes to kill bacteria . Bacteria may escape from the phagosome before the formation of the phagolysosome : Listeria monocytogenes can make a hole in the phagosome wall using enzymes called listeriolysin O and phospholipase C.",

Will you be available to go to your child 's softball game or have time to cook dinner ? \" There are many reasons why someone may put off to school until their children are older , such as not wanting to leave them in the hand of a baby sitter constantly at such a young age . However , once the children get older the parent pursuing an education , may start missing school events that they would have normally attended . The guilt of having to leave a child while attending to educational matters is less when the child is old enough to be able to ask questions about where their parent is and comprehend the response . Even though pursuing an education while nurturing a family will have its cost , the benefits include getting a higher paying job , gaining more knowledge , and becoming more stable financially . Most of the time this burden will include the person trying to balance a job along with their family and schooling , because they still need to work in order to provide for their family at the present moment . For people who have a hard time fitting classes into their schedule around the needs of their family , there are options where they will be required to do all of the work for a course , but it will all take place online .

While Rogers ' expedition was profitable , when it returned to London in 1715 , the British East India Company vetoed the idea of a colonial expedition to Madagascar , believing a colony was a greater threat to its monopoly than a few pirates . Accordingly , Rogers turned his sights from Madagascar to the West Indies .

  "Newton ( test plate ) interferometry is frequently used in the optical industry for testing the quality of surfaces as they are being shaped and figured . Fig . 13 shows photos of reference flats being used to check two test flats at different stages of completion , showing the different patterns of interference fringes . The reference flats are resting with their bottom surfaces in contact with the test flats , and they are illuminated by a monochromatic light source . The light waves reflected from both surfaces interfere , resulting in a pattern of bright and dark bands . The surface in the left photo is nearly flat , indicated by a pattern of straight parallel interference fringes at equal intervals . The surface in the right photo is uneven , resulting in a pattern of curved fringes . Each pair of adjacent fringes represents a difference in surface elevation of half a wavelength of the light used , so differences in elevation can be measured by counting the fringes . The flatness of the surfaces can be measured to millionths of an inch by this method . To determine whether the surface being tested is concave or convex with respect to the reference optical flat , any of several procedures may be adopted . One can observe how the fringes are displaced when one presses gently on the top flat . If one observes the fringes in white light , the sequence of colors becomes familiar with experience and aids in interpretation . Finally one may compare the appearance of the fringes as one moves ones head from a normal to an oblique viewing position . These sorts of maneuvers , while common in the optical shop , are not suitable in a formal testing environment . When the flats are ready for sale , they will typically be mounted in a Fizeau interferometer for formal testing and certification .",

  "The gender roles of men and women , as well as societies ' conceptions of the associated concepts , are frequent themes in Achebe 's writing . He has been criticised as a sexist author , in response to what many call the uncritical depiction of traditionally patriarchal Igbo society , where the most masculine men take numerous wives , and women are beaten regularly . Paradoxically , Igbo society immensely values individual achievement but also sees the ownership over or acquisition of women as a signifier of success . As seen in Things Fall Apart , Igbo society condemns violence but Okonkwo 's ability to control ‘ his ’ women is inextricably connected to his dignity . Thus , women are automatically disenfranschised in terms of achieving high status related to personal achievement . Others suggest that Achebe is merely representing the limited gendered vision of the characters , and they note that in his later works , he tries to demonstrate the inherent dangers of excluding women from society . It is also suggested that Achebe purposefully created exaggerated gender binaries in order to render Igbo history recognizable to international readers . Still others suggest that reading Achebe through a womanist lens enables an understanding of Igbo conceptions of gender complementarity . Womanism is “ an afrocentric concept forged out of global feminism to analyze the condition of Black African women ” that acknowledges the patriarchal oppression of women , but also highlights the resistance and dignity of African women . As the representation of Igbo society and kinship structures in novels such as Things Fall Apart differs considerably from the work of African feminist anthropology , the representation should not be taken literally ; rather , the reader should consider the roles of both women and men as intentionally stark and in opposition . In any case , a careful reading of Achebe paradoxically recognizes the hyperbolic representation of gender politics in Igbo society , while acknowledging the necessary nuance that gives Achebe ’ s women some agency and prominence .",

  "A play of The Disenchanted opened on Broadway in 1958 . Also that year , Scott 's Hollywood mistress Sheilah Graham published a memoir , Beloved Infidel , about his last years . Beloved Infidel became a bestseller and later a film starring Gregory Peck as Scott and Deborah Kerr as Graham . The book and movie painted him in a more sympathetic light than the earlier works .

It was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award , and figured for weeks on The New York Times best @-@ seller list .

When Tennessee Williams dramatized their lives in the 1980s Clothes for a Summer Hotel , he drew heavily on Milford 's account . A caricature of Scott and Zelda emerged : as epitomizing the Jazz Age 's glorification of youth , as representatives of the Lost Generation , and as parable about the pitfalls of too much success .",

  "Love 's Last Shift can be seen as an early sign of Cibber 's sensitivity to shifts of public opinion , which was to be useful to him in his later career as manager at Drury Lane ( see Colley Cibber ) . In the 1690s , the economic and political power balance of the nation tilted from the aristocracy towards the middle class after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 , and middle @-@ class values of religion , morality , and gender roles became more dominant , not least in attitudes to the stage . Love 's Last Shift is one of the first illustrations of a massive shift in audience taste , away from the analytic bent and sexual frankness of Restoration comedy and towards the conservative certainties and gender role backlash of exemplary or sentimental comedy . The play illustrates Cibber 's opportunism at a moment in time before the change was assured : fearless of self @-@ contradiction , he puts something into his first play to please every section of the audience , combining the old outspokenness with the new preachiness . The way Vanbrugh , in his turn , allows the reformed rake to relapse quite cheerfully , and has the only preaching in the play come from the comically corrupt parson of \" Fatgoose Living \" , has made some early 20th @-@ century critics refer to The Relapse as the last of the true Restoration comedies . However , Vanbrugh 's play is also affected by the taste of the 1690s , and compared to a play like the courtier William Wycherley 's The Country Wife of 20 years earlier , with its celebration of predatory aristocratic masculinity , The Relapse contains quite a few moments of morality and uplift . In fact it has a kind of parallel structure to Love 's Last Shift : in the climactic scene of Cibber 's play , Amanda 's virtue reforms her husband , and in the corresponding scene of The Relapse , it reforms her admirer Worthy . Such moments have not done the play any favours with modern critics .",

Like # 1 Record , Radio City received excellent reviews , but label issues again thwarted sales — Columbia Records , which had assumed control of the Stax catalog , likewise effectively vetoed its distribution . After a third album was deemed non @-@ commercially viable and shelved before receiving a title , the band broke up late in 1974 . Four years later , the first two Big Star LPs were released together in the UK as a double album . The band 's third album was finally issued soon afterward ; titled Third / Sister Lovers , it found limited commercial success . Shortly thereafter , Chris Bell was killed in a car accident at the age of 27 .",
  "Inquiry over a new title was subsequently large enough to warrant an entry in Square Enix 's FAQ page , in which the company noted that no new game was in development , though this did not mean the series was dead .

  "The modern concept of the photon was developed gradually by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century to explain experimental observations that did not fit the classical wave model of light . The benefit of the photon model was that it accounted for the frequency dependence of light 's energy , and explained the ability of matter and electromagnetic radiation to be in thermal equilibrium . The photon model accounted for anomalous observations , including the properties of black @-@ body radiation , that others ( notably Max Planck ) had tried to explain using semiclassical models . In that model , light was described by Maxwell 's equations , but material objects emitted and absorbed light in quantized amounts ( i.e. , they change energy only by certain particular discrete amounts ) . Although these semiclassical models contributed to the development of quantum mechanics , many further experiments beginning with the phenomenon of Compton scattering of single photons by electrons , validated Einstein 's hypothesis that light itself is quantized . In 1926 the optical physicist Frithiof Wolfers and the chemist Gilbert N. Lewis coined the name photon for these particles . After Arthur H. Compton won the Nobel Prize in 1927 for his scattering studies , most scientists accepted that light quanta have an independent existence , and the term photon was accepted .",

  "The type of soil would make a difference to the design of the motte , as clay soils could support a steeper motte , whilst sandier soils meant that a motte would need a more gentle incline .

Layers of turf could also be added to stabilise the motte as it was built up , or a core of stones placed as the heart of the structure to provide strength . Similar issues applied to the defensive ditches , where designers found that the wider the ditch was dug , the deeper and steeper the sides of the scarp could be , making it more defensive . Although militarily a motte was , as Norman Pounds describes it , \" almost indestructible \" , they required frequent maintenance .

  "Darwin 's interest on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence ; in particular , he was looking for confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths . FitzRoy 's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20 fathoms ( 37 m ) , and taking into account numerous observations by others , Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30 fathoms ( 55 m ) . Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100 m , still a small fraction of the depth of the ocean floor at 3000 – 5000 m . Darwin recognised the importance of red algae , and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs . He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths , but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s . Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef . He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae ; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level . He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity . These ecological ideas are still current , and research on the details continues .",

Most of these sectarian Upanishads , for example the Rudrahridaya Upanishad and the Mahanarayana Upanishad , assert that all the Hindu gods and goddesses are the same , all an aspect and manifestation of Brahman , the Vedic concept for metaphysical ultimate reality before and after the creation of the Universe .",

  "The original design of the Indiana class included bilge keels , but with keels they would not fit in any of the American drydocks at the time , so they were omitted during construction . This meant a reduction in stability and caused a serious problem for Indiana , when both main turrets broke loose from their clamps in heavy seas a year after being commissioned . Because the turrets were not centrally balanced , they swung from side to side with the motion of the ship , until they were secured with heavy ropes . When the ship encountered more bad weather four months later , she promptly steamed back to port for fear the clamps would break again .

  "Back in the world of academia , Du Bois was able to resume his study of Reconstruction , the topic of the 1910 paper that he presented to the American Historical Association . In 1935 , he published his magnum opus , Black Reconstruction in America . The book presented the thesis , in the words of the historian David Levering Lewis , that \" black people , suddenly admitted to citizenship in an environment of feral hostility , displayed admirable volition and intelligence as well as the indolence and ignorance inherent in three centuries of bondage . \" Du Bois documented how black people were central figures in the American Civil War and Reconstruction , and also showed how they made alliances with white politicians . He provided evidence that the coalition governments established public education in the South , and many needed social service programs . The book also demonstrated the ways in which black emancipation – the crux of Reconstruction – promoted a radical restructuring of United States society , as well as how and why the country failed to continue support for civil rights for blacks in the aftermath of Reconstruction .",

  "Spinal cord injuries generally result in at least some incurable impairment even with the best possible treatment . The best predictor of prognosis is the level and completeness of injury , as measured by the ASIA impairment scale . The neurological score at the initial evaluation done 72 hours after injury is the best predictor of how much function will return . Most people with ASIA scores of A ( complete injuries ) do not have functional motor recovery , but improvement can occur . Most patients with incomplete injuries recover at least some function . Chances of recovering the ability to walk improve with each AIS grade found at the initial examination ; e.g. an ASIA D score confers a better chance of walking than a score of C. The symptoms of incomplete injuries can vary and it is difficult to make an accurate prediction of the outcome . A person with a mild , incomplete injury at the T5 vertebra will have a much better chance of using his or her legs than a person with a severe , complete injury at exactly the same place . Of the incomplete SCI syndromes , Brown @-@ Séquard and central cord syndromes have the best prognosis for recovery and anterior cord syndrome has the worst . People with nontraumatic causes of SCI have been found to be less likely to suffer complete injuries and some complications such as pressure sores and deep vein thrombosis , and to have shorter hospital stays . Their scores on functional tests were better than those of people with traumatic SCI upon hospital admission , but when they were tested upon discharge , those with traumatic SCI had improved such that both groups ' results were the same . In addition to the completeness and level of the injury , age and concurrent health problems affect the extent to which a person with SCI will be able to live independently and to walk . However , in general people with injuries to L3 or below will likely be able to walk functionally , T10 and below to walk around the house with bracing , and C7 and below to live independently .",

He cited the scene in which Shawn and Gus are trapped by the criminals as an example of why the episode was the funniest to him . However , Keller also had a few complaints with the installment . He criticized the episode 's beginning , where \" a seemingly large evergreen forest looming \" can be seen , saying that it ruined the illusion of the show taking place in Santa Barbara . He stated that \" the whole thing seemed a little bit incomplete \" due to the lack of a complete \" psychic reveal \" at the end of the episode , and that the reduced use of Corbin Bernsen in the installment was an issue .",
  "According to the Church , people have a right to private property . However , ownership makes that person \" a steward \" who is expected to make it \" fruitful \" or profitable in a way that benefits others after that person has first taken care of their family . Private property and the common good are seen as complementary elements that exist for the purpose of strengthening society . The taking of another 's private property \" in obvious and urgent necessity \" as \" the only way to provide for immediate , essential needs ( food , shelter , clothing ) \" is not considered by the Church to be stealing . The concept of slavery as private property is condemned by the Church , which classifies it as the stealing of a person 's human rights .",

Modern scholars now generally believe that the Zuo zhuan was originally an independent work composed during the latter half of the 4th century BC — though probably incorporating some even older material — that was later rearranged as a commentary to the Annals .",

  "Hutchinson 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , colonial secretary Andrew Oliver , was given the job of \" stamp master \" , with responsibility for implementing the act in the province . Although Hutchinson apparently had no hand in this assignment , his opponents were quick to accuse him of further duplicity . His attempts to explain his position only fuelled the opposition , who recounted his early unpopular acts and questioned his motives in those deeds . On 13 August 1765 , mobs descended on Oliver 's home and office , ransacking both . The next night Hutchinson 's Boston mansion was surrounded , and the crowd demanded that he formally deny arguing in favour of the Stamp Act in his correspondence with London . He refused , and only the intervention of a moderate leader prevented any action that night .",

  "Many of the period 's artworks were commissioned by clergy for their churches , with specifications for a physical format and pictorial content that would complement existing architectural and design schemes . An idea of how such church interiors might have looked can be seen from both van Eyck 's Madonna in the Church and van der Weyden 's Exhumation of St Hubert . According to Nash , van der Weyden 's panel is an insightful look at the appearance of pre @-@ Reformation churches , and the manner in which images were placed so that they resonated with other paintings or objects . Nash goes on to say that , \" any one would necessarily be seen in relation to other images , repeating , enlarging , or diversifying the chosen themes \" . Because iconoclasts targeted churches and cathedrals , important information about the display of individual works has been lost , and with it , insights about the meaning of these artworks in their own time . Many other works were lost to fires or in wars ; the break @-@ up of the Valois Burgundian state made the Low Countries the cockpit of European conflict until 1945 . Van der Weyden 's The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald polyptych is perhaps the most significant loss ; from records it appears to have been comparable in scale and ambition to the Ghent Altarpiece . It was destroyed by French artillery during the bombardment of Brussels in 1695 , and is today known only from a tapestry copy .",

  "Between 1948 and 1950 , she developed a theory by which these mobile elements regulated the genes by inhibiting or modulating their action . She referred to Dissociator and Activator as \" controlling units \" — later , as \" controlling elements \" — to distinguish them from genes . She hypothesized that gene regulation could explain how complex multicellular organisms made of cells with identical genomes have cells of different function .

  "Guevara 's life and legacy remain contentious . The perceived contradictions of his ethos at various points in his life have created a complex character of duality , one who was \" able to wield the pen and submachine gun with equal skill , \" while prophesying that \" the most important revolutionary ambition was to see man liberated from his alienation . \" As undogmatic as he was committed , his vision of liberation was at once romantic , poetic , compassionate , and ruthless . Guevara 's paradoxical standing is further complicated by his array of seemingly diametrically opposed qualities .

  "Fishers have few predators besides humans . They have been trapped since the 18th century for their fur .

  "According to the Azores High hypothesis , an anti @-@ phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast . During the quiescent periods , a more northeasterly position of the Azores High would result in more hurricanes being steered towards the Atlantic coast . During the hyperactive period , more hurricanes were steered towards the Gulf coast as the Azores High was shifted to a more southwesterly position near the Caribbean . Such a displacement of the Azores High is consistent with paleoclimatic evidence that shows an abrupt onset of a drier climate in Haiti around 3200 14C years BP , and a change towards more humid conditions in the Great Plains during the late @-@ Holocene as more moisture was pumped up the Mississippi Valley through the Gulf coast .

  "The water quality of the Little Applegate River watershed is generally poor due to high temperatures , sedimentation , and oxygen saturation levels which occur throughout the region . Most of these problems are created by human activity ; forests and riparian zones have been cleared to make way for agriculture , and high road densities cause slope failures . Hydraulic mining near Sterlingville devastated the surrounding landscape , leaving the slopes bare and sending rocks and gravel downstream . Cattle and sheep were introduced to the area in the late 19th century ; they have since overgrazed some areas of the watershed , reducing native grasses and allowing noxious weeds to spread . Overgrazing also contributes to soil erosion . Large amounts of water is diverted from the river and its tributaries , sometimes to such an extent that the mouth is left nearly dry .",

The story is told from the point of view of an anonymous correspondent , with Crane as the implied author , the action closely resembles the author 's experiences after the shipwreck . A volume titled The Open Boat and Other Tales of Adventure was published in the United States in 1898 ; an edition entitled The Open Boat and Other Stories was published simultaneously in England . Praised for its innovation by contemporary critics , the story is considered an exemplary work of literary Naturalism , and is one of the most frequently discussed works in Crane 's canon . It is notable for its use of imagery , irony , symbolism , and the exploration of such themes as survival , solidarity , and the conflict between man and nature . H. G.

  "Peter Bailey , in his study \" White Collars , Gray Lives \" ( 1999 ) , traces the beginnings of literary interest in the lower @-@ middle classes to the \" disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers \" that faced Victorian writers in the last quarter of the 19th century . The Grossmiths ' Diary was a typical satire of its time ; it probed the lower @-@ middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns . Tony Joseph calls the Diary \" a sharp analysis of social insecurity \" . Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds , they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn : \" putting the boot in on the lower middle classes \" , says Bailey , \" has long been the intellectual 's blood sport \" . However , the quarter @-@ century following the publication of The Diary of a Nobody saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy , even approval . In the works of writers such as George Gissing , H. G. Wells , Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster , characters emerged who , despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives , were by no means entirely absurd . Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as \" Denry Machin \" , \" Mr Polly \" or \" Mr Lewisham \" , while at the same time celebrating their fortitude , energy and determination to look for better things . In cases such as these , writes Bailey , \" disdain could change to admiration and national self @-@ identification , as the Little Man ... was transposed into Everyman , a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis . \"",

  "Language contact may also lead to a variety of other linguistic phenomena , including language convergence , borrowing , and relexification ( replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language ) . In situations of extreme and sustained language contact , it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family . One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis , but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently . In such a case , they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages , but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure . The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages . Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers , but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language . But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community , then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language . As the generation of child learners grow up , the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity . This type of language is generally called a creole language . An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin , the official language of Papua New @-@ Guinea , which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages ; others are Kreyòl ayisyen , the French @-@ based creole language spoken in Haiti , and Michif , a mixed language of Canada , based on the Native American language Cree and French .",

  "Geography affects solar energy potential because areas that are closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation . However , the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator . Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the nighttime there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for solar panels to absorb . This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day . Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells .",

Upon learning of Japan 's successful attack , Hitler even became euphoric , stating : \" With such a capable ally we cannot lose this war . \" Preceding Japan 's attack were numerous communiqués between Berlin and Tokyo . The respective ambassadors Ott and Ōshima tried to draft an amendment to the Tripartite Pact , in which Germany , Japan and Italy should pledge each other 's allegiance in the case one signatory is attacked by – or attacks – the United States . Although the protocol was finished in time , it would not be formally signed by Germany until four days after the raid on Pearl Harbor . Also among the communiqués was another definitive Japanese rejection of any war plans against Russia :",

  "Once a droplet has frozen , it grows in the supersaturated environment , which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point . The droplet then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air ( vapor ) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected . Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance , the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets . This process is known as the Wegener – Bergeron – Findeisen process . The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate , meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets ' expense . These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation , since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass , and may collide and stick together in clusters , or aggregates . These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground . Guinness World Records list the world 's largest ( aggregate ) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh , Montana ; allegedly one measured 15 inches ( 38 cm ) wide .

Hutchinson is not a fan of the revelation that Laurie and Michael are siblings and took steps to address that problem in the story . He wanted to avoid the \" bloodline plot of the middle sequels \" , which he felt demystified the character of the Shape , and approach the story so that \" it becomes almost incidental that she 's his sister \" . Hutchinson believed that Laurie Strode 's evolution into Keri Tate was fertile ground for a storyline ; he says , \" it 's not the faking of the death that 's interesting at all , but it ’ s the fall that leads to that happening . The faked death is just simple mechanics and can be covered in a sentence , but the state of mind and events leading to that are full of rich character and dramatic potential . \"",
  "A typical killer whale distinctively bears a black back , white chest and sides , and a white patch above and behind the eye . Calves are born with a yellowish or orange tint , which fades to white . It has a heavy and robust body with a large dorsal fin up to 1 @.@ 8 m ( 5 @.@ 9 ft ) tall . Behind the fin , it has a dark grey \" saddle patch \" across the back . Antarctic killer whales may have pale grey to nearly white backs . Adult killer whales are very distinctive and are not usually confused with any other sea creature . When seen from a distance , juveniles can be confused with other cetacean species , such as the false killer whale or Risso 's dolphin . The killer whale 's teeth are very strong and its jaws exert a powerful grip ; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed . The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward , thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place .",
  "Plasma temperature is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is , informally , a measure of the thermal kinetic energy per particle . High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization , which is a defining feature of a plasma . The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the electron temperature relative to the ionization energy ( and more weakly by the density ) , in a relationship called the Saha equation . At low temperatures , ions and electrons tend to recombine into bound states — atoms — and the plasma will eventually become a gas .",

  "The unique lungs of baleen whales are built to collapse under the pressure instead of resisting the pressure which would damage the lungs , enabling some , like the fin whale , to dive to a depth of − 1 @,@ 540 feet ( − 470 m ) . The whale lungs are very efficient at extracting oxygen from the air , usually 80 % , whereas humans only extract 20 % of oxygen from inhaled air . Lung volume is relatively low compared to terrestrial mammals because of the inability of the respiratory tract to hold gas while diving . Doing so may cause serious complications such as embolism . Unlike other mammals , the lungs of baleen whales lack lobes and are more sacculated . Like in humans , the left lung is smaller than the right to make room for the heart .

  "The discovery of nuclear fission by Otto Hahn in December 1938 ( and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner ) generated intense interest among physicists . Bohr brought the news to the United States where he opened the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics with Fermi on 26 January 1939 . When Bohr told George Placzek that this resolved all the mysteries of transuranic elements , Placzek told him that one remained : the neutron capture energies of uranium did not match those of its decay . Bohr thought about it for a few minutes and then announced to Placzek , Léon Rosenfeld and John Wheeler that \" I have understood everything . \" Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus , Bohr concluded that it was the uranium @-@ 235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium @-@ 238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons . In April 1940 , John R. Dunning demonstrated that Bohr was correct . In the meantime , Bohr and Wheeler developed a theoretical treatment which they published in a September 1939 paper on \" The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission \" .",

  "The Great Tower at Raglan Castle , sometimes called the Yellow Tower of Gwent , sits outside the rest of the castle , protected by a moat and linked to the Fountain Court by a bridge . The fortification is representative of a trend during the 15th and 16th centuries in British castle building : tower keeps such as this , large , solid buildings designed for private accommodation , probably inspired by those in France , had started to appear in the 14th century at Dudley and Warkworth . In the 15th century the fashion spread , with the creation of French @-@ influenced palatial castles featuring complex tower keeps , such as those at Wardour and Tattershall .

  "Though Napoleon had a warlike reputation , his policies in his first years as First Consul were aimed at restoring peace in Europe , be it at terms favorable to France . The animus of the members of the Second Coalition was mostly against the French Revolution , its ideas and its consequences . By this time Napoleon himself was convinced of their perfidy . Talleyrand and Napoleon therefore saw a possibility of a compromise , in which France would retain its chain of docile client states , but with the \" revolutionary \" sting removed , to appease the Allies . That unrevolutionary docility was to be assured by constitutions designed to eliminate not only domestic conflict ( as was the new French political order ) , but also any flashes of impertinent nationalism . France therefore embarked on a program of constitutional reform in the dependent republics , first in the Helvetic Republic , where Napoleon as Mediator imposed the Constitution of Malmaison in 1801 ( followed by the Second Helvetic Constitution a year later ) , restoring the old confederal order .",

However , because of its tribal origin , Ohlone is not universally accepted by the native people , and some members prefer to either to continue to use the name Costanoan or to revitalize and be known as the Muwekma . Teixeira maintains Ohlone is the common usage since 1960 , which has been traced back to the Rancho Oljon on the Pescadero Creek . Teixeira states in part : \" A tribe that once existed along the San Mateo County coast . \" Milliken states the name came from : \" A tribe on the lower drainages of San Gregorio Creek and Pescadero Creek on the Pacific Coast \" . The popularity of the name Ohlone is largely because of the book The History of San Jose and Surroundings by Frederic Hall ( 1871 ) , in which he noted that : \" The tribe of Indians which roamed over this great [ Santa Clara ] valley , from San Francisco to near San Juan Bautista Mission ... were the Ohlones or ( Costanes ) . \" Two other names are growing in popularity and use by the tribes instead of Costanoan and Ohlone , notably Muwekma in the north , and Amah by the Mutsun . Muwekma is the native people 's word for the people in the language of Chochenyo and Tamyen . Amah is the native people 's word for the people in Mutsun .",

Its location was never forgotten by the local K 'iche 's although it was from time to time lost by outside investigators . French missionary Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg located Pismachi ' in the middle of the 19th century , it was then lost until it was relocated in 1956 by Jorge Guillemín , working in collaboration with the government of Guatemala , the location was reconfirmed by Robert Carmack in 1969 .

  "In 1921 , Rollin Woodyatt reviewed the research on diet and diabetes . He reported that three water @-@ soluble compounds , β @-@ hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate and acetone ( known collectively as ketone bodies ) , were produced by the liver in otherwise healthy people when they were starved or if they consumed a very low @-@ carbohydrate , high @-@ fat diet . Russel Wilder , at the Mayo Clinic , built on this research and coined the term ketogenic diet to describe a diet that produced a high level of ketone bodies in the blood ( ketonemia ) through an excess of fat and lack of carbohydrate . Wilder hoped to obtain the benefits of fasting in a dietary therapy that could be maintained indefinitely . His trial on a few epilepsy patients in 1921 was the first use of the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy .",

  "Proposals for the South Beltline Freeway were nearly 25 years old by the time initial construction was started in 1997 . The Michigan State Legislature named the South Beltline around the same time for the Congressman Paul B. Henry , who died in office in 1993 , serving in Gerald Ford 's old US House seat . The cost of the construction of new roads like the South Beltline was a campaign issue when Engler ran for re @-@ election against Geoffrey Feiger in 1998 . The entire freeway was projected to open by 2008 , with the first phase opening in 2002 . MDOT gave the South Beltline its numerical designation on the July 1999 edition of the state map , marking M @-@ 6 for the first time as a dotted line , to denote it was \" under construction \" . The legislature approved Engler 's \" Build Michigan III \" program in 2000 ; the plan accelerated road projects in the state . The capital outlay for the year was $ 82 million ( equivalent to $ 132 million in 2015 ) . Condemnation proceedings were initiated in the Kent County Circuit Court in 1999 to clear the way for the acquisitions . Land that contained homes , farms , trailer parks , and businesses was purchased by MDOT to acquire the right @-@ of @-@ way needed for the freeway . The land needed measured 360 feet ( 110 m ) wide and 20 miles ( 32 km ) long . Land acquisitions for the South Beltline Freeway were completed in July 2001 .

The film received average reviews , however , A.O. Scott of the New York Times , reported that the performances by both Sarsgaard and Parker \" provide a rough grain of authenticity , capturing the blunted affect and aimless neediness of people in their 20s struggling to navigate a world of material abundance and impoverished emotional possibility . \" Scott concluded in his recap that Sarsgaard made his character \" seem like a genuinely nice guy , too innocent to grasp the sleaziness of his bargain with Florence . \"",
  "Cockatoos have a much more restricted range than the true parrots , occurring naturally only in Australasia , Indonesia and the Phillippines . Eleven of the 21 species exist in the wild only in Australia , while seven species occur only in the islands of the Philippines , Indonesia , Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands . Interestingly , no cockatoo species are found in Borneo ( despite their presence on nearby Palawan and Sulawesi ) or many Pacific islands , although fossil remains have been recorded from New Caledonia .",
  "On Wheeler 's death , H.D. Sankalia of Deccan College , Pune , described him as \" well known among Old World archaeologists in the United States \" , particularly for his book Archaeology from the Earth and his studies of the Indus Valley Civilisation . In its 2013 obituary of the English archaeologist Mick Aston , British Archaeology magazine – the publication of the Council for British Archaeology – described Aston as \" the Mortimer Wheeler of our times \" because despite the strong differences between their personalities , both had done much to bring archaeology to the British public . However , writing in 2011 , Moshenska and Schadla @-@ Hall asserted that Wheeler 's reputation has not undergone significant revision among archaeologists , but that instead he had come to be remembered as \" a cartoonish and slightly eccentric figure \" whom they termed \" Naughty Morty \" . Carr described the Institute of Archaeology as \" one of the [ Wheeler ] couple 's most permanent memorials . \"",

  "On the other hand , it has been suggested that the enactment of a statute by Parliament in the face of an adverse report by the PCMR should be taken as a \" mere disagreement over the interpretation of the Constitution and thus should not foreclose judicial review \" . However , this depends on whether the statute in question is a constitutional amendment or an ordinary Act of Parliament . Acts of Parliament may be disputed in court for their lack of compliance with the Constitution , but constitutional amendments may not be ."
