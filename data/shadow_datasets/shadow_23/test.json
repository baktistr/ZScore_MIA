  "Following the Fourth Crusade , the Orthodox clergy in the two main Greek states , Epirus and Nicaea , had effectively become separated . In 1208 , the Nicaeans had convened a synod and elected Michael Autoreianos as successor to the vacant see of the Patriarch of Constantinople . The election was uncanonical and therefore of questionable legitimacy . This in turn meant that Laskaris ' imperial title was also open to challenge , as he had been crowned by the same Michael Autoreianos . Already under Michael I , two local synods of bishops had emerged in the Epirote domains to carry on administration of the Church , largely independent of the Patriarch , one at Naupaktos under John Apokaukos , and one at Ohrid under Chomatianos .

Despite his close ties to Epirus , Stefan II Nemanjić exploited the Epirote – Nicaean rivalry to his advantage to secure autocephaly for the Serbian Church , which traditionally had been under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Ohrid . Brushing aside Chomatianos ' vehement objections , Stefan managed to have his brother Rastko , renamed Sava , consecrated by Manuel Sarantenos as autocephalous archbishop of Serbia in 1219 .

  "During the second half of 1998 an optically thick dust shell obscured Sakurai 's Object , causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star , until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether . Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form . In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical , as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134 ° , and inclination of around 75 ° . The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to the fast spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures .",

  "Subsequent military science studies of the use of Rangers during the Korean War have focused on analysing their economy of force by looking at how well the U.S. military employed them as special forces . In an analysis of the operations of all Ranger units in the Korean War , Major Chelsea Y. Chae proposed in a 1996 thesis to the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College that they were misused and ineffective in general , and that in particular the Eighth Army Ranger Company had been poorly employed . Chae noted that the Ranger formations ' lack of support personnel made them a logistic and administrative liability , as they had to be attached to conventional units for support . Furthermore , he argued that the Rangers ' small formation sizes meant that they lacked the manpower to conduct basic tactical maneuvers , and their employment with divisional elements did not provide them with the intelligence information necessary for effective infiltration operations . He concluded that these problems were due to a \" lack of understanding of Ranger capabilities , limitations inherent in Rangers ' force structure , and basic distrust of elite forces . \"",

  "This interest in the ' Arthur of romance ' and his associated stories continued through the 19th century and into the 20th , and influenced poets such as William Morris and Pre @-@ Raphaelite artists including Edward Burne @-@ Jones . Even the humorous tale of Tom Thumb , which had been the primary manifestation of Arthur 's legend in the 18th century , was rewritten after the publication of Idylls . While Tom maintained his small stature and remained a figure of comic relief , his story now included more elements from the medieval Arthurian romances and Arthur is treated more seriously and historically in these new versions . The revived Arthurian romance also proved influential in the United States , with such books as Sidney Lanier 's The Boy 's King Arthur ( 1880 ) reaching wide audiences and providing inspiration for Mark Twain 's satiric A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court ( 1889 ) . Although the ' Arthur of romance ' was sometimes central to these new Arthurian works ( as he was in Burne @-@ Jones 's \" The Sleep of Arthur in Avalon \" , 1881 @-@ 1898 ) , on other occasions he reverted to his medieval status and is either marginalized or even missing entirely , with Wagner 's Arthurian operas providing a notable instance of the latter .

  "The robin is diurnal , although has been reported to be active hunting insects on moonlit nights or near artificial light at night . Well known to British and Irish gardeners , it is relatively unafraid of people and drawn to human activities involving the digging of soil , in order to look out for earthworms and other food freshly turned up . Indeed , the robin is considered to be a gardener 's friend and for various folklore reasons the robin would never be harmed . In continental Europe on the other hand , robins were hunted and killed as with most other small birds , and are more wary . Robins also approach large wild animals , such as wild boar and other animals which disturb the ground , to look for any food that might be brought to the surface . In autumn and winter , robins will supplement their usual diet of terrestrial invertebrates , such as spiders , worms and insects , with berries and fruit .

  "In June 2002 Gore Verbinski signed on to direct The Curse of the Black Pearl , and Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush signed on the following month to star . Verbinski was attracted to the idea of using modern technology to resurrect a genre , one that had disappeared after the Golden Age of Hollywood , and recalled his childhood memories of the ride , feeling the film was an opportunity to pay tribute to the \" scary and funny \" tone of it . Depp was attracted to the story as he found it quirky : rather than trying to find treasure , the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse ; also , the traditional mutiny had already taken place . Verbinski approached Rush for the role of Barbossa , as he knew he would not play it with attempts at complexity , but with a simple villainy that would suit the story 's tone . Orlando Bloom read the script after Rush , with whom he was working on Ned Kelly , suggested it to him . Keira Knightley came as a surprise to Verbinski : he had not seen her performance in Bend It Like Beckham and was impressed by her audition . Tom Wilkinson was negotiated with to play Governor Swann , but the role went to Jonathan Pryce , whom Depp idolized .",

  "The latter @-@ day , post @-@ Sweetheart of the Rodeo version of the band , featuring McGuinn and White 's dual lead guitar work , toured relentlessly between 1969 and 1972 and was regarded by critics and audiences as much more accomplished in concert than any previous configuration of the Byrds had been . As a result of this , it was decided in early 1970 that the time was right for the group to issue a live album . However , it was also felt that the band had a sufficient backlog of new compositions to warrant the recording of a new studio album . It was therefore suggested by producer Terry Melcher that the band should release a double album , featuring one LP of concert recordings and another LP of new studio material . To help with the editing of the live recordings , the band 's ex @-@ manager Jim Dickson , who had been fired by the group in June 1967 , was invited back into the Byrds ' camp .

  "Intra @-@ patera eruptions occur within volcanic depressions known as paterae , which generally have flat floors bounded by steep walls . Paterae resemble terrestrial calderas , but it is unknown whether they form when an empty lava chamber collapses , like their terrestrial cousins . One hypothesis suggests that they are produced through the exhumation of volcanic sills , with the overlying material either being blasted out or integrated into the sill . Some paterae display evidence for multiple collapses , similar to the calderas atop Olympus Mons on Mars or Kīlauea on Earth , suggesting that they may occasionally form like volcanic calderas . Because the formation mechanism is still uncertain , the general term for these features uses the Latin descriptor term employed by the International Astronomical Union in naming them , paterae . Unlike similar features on Earth and Mars , these depressions generally do not lie at the peak of shield volcanoes and are larger , with an average diameter of 41 kilometres ( 25 mi ) . Patera depths have been measured for only a few paterae and typically exceed 1 km . The largest volcanic depression on Io is Loki Patera at 202 kilometres ( 126 mi ) across . Whatever the formation mechanism , the morphology and distribution of many paterae suggest that they are structurally controlled , with at least half bounded by faults or mountains .",

  "The 350th anniversary of Monteverdi 's death , celebrated in 1993 , brought a further wave of interest in his works , and since that time performances of L 'incoronazione have been given in opera houses and music festivals all over the world .

  "Two charters of 681 show Æthelred granting land near Tetbury , on what is now the border between Gloucestershire and Wiltshire . This may indicate that Æthelred was able to extend Mercian influence further into the territory of the West Saxons , as Wulfhere had done before him . The West Saxons managed a significant military resurgence under Cædwalla , king of Wessex from about 685 to 688 , but when Cædwalla departed for Rome on pilgrimage there may have been internal strife before Ine , his successor , took the throne . Cædwalla had successfully conquered the kingdoms of Sussex and Kent , and his abdication may have contributed to the unsettled history of the southeast over the next few years . In Kent , Oswine emerged as king , though only in eastern Kent ; the western half of the kingdom was ruled by Swæfheard , son of Sæbbi , the king of Essex . It is possible that Æthelred provided support to both Swæfheard and Oswine ; for each king a charter survives in which Æthelred confirms land grants they made in Kent , and Æthelred 's invasion of Kent in 676 indicates his opposition to the traditional Kentish royal house . A charter of Swæfheard 's dated 691 is also of interest as it indicates that Æthelred had invaded Kent ; it has been suggested that Æthelred intended to place Wilfrid in the Archbishop 's seat at Canterbury , but if so he was unsuccessful . Alternatively , Æthelred may have needed assistance in Kent from the East Saxons who may have been independent of Mercia for a decade or more by that time . The East Saxons did return to the Mercian orbit over the next few years : a charter of Æthelred 's , dated between 693 and 704 , shows him granting land to Wealdhere , the bishop of London , and in 704 Æthelred consented to a grant made by Swæfheard . The latter charter also appears to show that a comes , or local official , was put in place by the Mercians to protect their interests .",

  "Long @-@ term plans for the line imply that the line will need to allow a through speed of at least 250 kilometers per hour ( 160 mph ) and be built so trains do not need to stop or slow down at all stations . The National Rail Administration had at the time of construction not made any plans for a route south of Tønsberg ; estimates from Norsk Bane show that Tønsberg will not be able to allow high through speeds and that a new through line would have be built with a different right @-@ of @-@ way , entirely avoiding the Jarlsberg Tunnel . Alternatively , the route would have to feature slow speeds or large encroachments on the local environment .

  "Van der Weyden worked in the same tradition of portraiture as contemporaries Jan van Eyck and Robert Campin . In the early to middle 15th century , these three artists were among the first generation of \" Northern Renaissance \" painters , and the first northern Europeans to portray members of the middle and upper classes naturalistically rather than in a medieval Christian idealised form . In earlier Netherlandish art the profile view was the dominant mode of representation for the nobles or clergy worthy of portraiture . In works such as Portrait of a Man in a Turban ( 1433 ) , Jan van Eyck broke this tradition and used the three @-@ quarter profile of the face which became the standard in Netherlandish art .

  "Voltaire depicts the worst of the world and his pathetic hero 's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook . Almost all of Candide is a discussion of various forms of evil : its characters rarely find even temporary respite . There is at least one notable exception : the episode of El Dorado , a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational , and their society is just and reasonable . The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book . Even in this case , the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting : Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cunégonde , whom he eventually marries only out of a sense of obligation .",

  "By this point , the only military support for Moreno was Domingo French , head of \" The Star \" regiment . Castelli and Belgrano supported him , but were far away from the capital on their respective military campaigns . The activists of the May Revolution supported him as well , as did other members of the Junta and other patriots like Vieytes and Nicolás Rodríguez Peña . Saavedra kept the strong support of the Regiment of Patricians , and added that of the merchants and even some supporters of the former regime who deemed the moderated Saavedra a lesser evil . Moreno sought to modify the military balance of power by reforming the promotion rules . Up until that point , the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority ; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead . However , in the short run this measure worked against him , as it antagonised members of the military who got promoted precisely because of such rules . He also thought that support from the lower classes was instrumental to the success of the Revolution , and wrote letters to Chiclana instructing him to generate such support at Upper Peru . Such popular involvement would take time to consolidate : the Guerra Gaucha , the War of the Republiquetas , and the rise of José Gervasio Artigas took place later , not as of 1810 .",

It was only at the end of the 19th century that calls for Indian troops to be awarded the Victoria Cross intensified . Indian troops became eligible for the award in 1911 . The first awards to Indian troops appeared in the London Gazette on 7 December 1914 to Darwan Sing Negi and Khudadad Khan . Negi was presented with the Victoria Cross by King George V during a visit to troops in France . The presentation occurred on 5 December 1914 and he is one of a very few soldiers presented with his award before it appeared in the London Gazette .",

The ship 's first operation was with troop ship convoy 67 , which departed New York on 23 September ; the rest of the escort consisted of the armored cruisers North Carolina and Montana and the destroyer Rathburne . Georgia had to take on 525 long tons ( 533 t ) of coal in addition to her normal stocks , which significantly degraded her seakeeping characteristics . The ship accordingly had to be battened down to reduce flooding from heavy seas , which had the effect of hastening the spread of disease . During the cruise , the crew suffered from 120 cases of influenza and 14 cases of pneumonia ; 7 men died from disease . Even with the additional coal , the ship did not have sufficient fuel to reach the hand off point and she had to break off from the convoy to return to port . Germany signed an Armistice with the Allied powers , ending the war on 11 November . On 10 December , the ship was equipped to serve as a transport to carry American soldiers back from France .

  "In 1839 , Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories ( both of whom Victoria detested ) voted against a bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica . The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery . The Queen commissioned a Tory , Sir Robert Peel , to form a new ministry . At the time , it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household , who were usually his political allies and their spouses . Many of the Queen 's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs , and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories . In what became known as the bedchamber crisis , Victoria , advised by Melbourne , objected to their removal . Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen , and consequently resigned his commission , allowing Melbourne to return to office .",
  "Unlike the stoat and least weasel , the European polecat is easy to breed in captivity . According to Aubyn Trevor @-@ Battye , the European polecat is difficult to tame , but is superior to its domesticated form , the ferret , in bolting rats from their holes due to its greater agility . It is prone to attempting escape once finished bolting rats , but can be easily outrun . Polecat kits can be successfully raised and suckled by mother cats . According to Owen 's Welsh Dictionary , the Gwythelians ( early Irish settlers in northern Wales ) kept polecats as pets . Attempts to tame the European polecat are generally hampered by the adult 's nervous and unsociable disposition . First generation hybrids between polecats and ferrets , conceived to improve the latter 's bloodlines , produce animals with personalities similar to their wild parents .",

  "By the late 19th century scientists realized that air could be liquefied and its components isolated by compressing and cooling it . Using a cascade method , Swiss chemist and physicist Raoul Pierre Pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide , which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it . He sent a telegram on December 22 , 1877 to the French Academy of Sciences in Paris announcing his discovery of liquid oxygen . Just two days later , French physicist Louis Paul Cailletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen . Only a few drops of the liquid were produced in each case and no meaningful analysis could be conducted .

  "Although officially neutral during the Peninsular War , the United States allowed rebels to trade at American ports and much of the weaponry and ammunition used by the rebels came from the United States . Americans also provided manpower for the conflict , with Natchitoches serving as a launching point for several expeditions into Texas . In 1812 , Mexican insurgent Bernardo Gutiérrez de Lara led a small force of Americans into Texas . Indians from the eastern part of Texas quickly joined the insurgency . Calling themselves the Republican Army of the North , the group captured San Antonio in 1813 , assassinated the governor , Manuel María de Salcedo , and proclaimed Texas independent from Spain . The death of the governor caused many of the Anglo @-@ Americans to desert the cause , but on April 17 , 1813 , the Gutiérrez – Magee Expedition members composed Texas 's first constitution , which provided for a centralized form of government .

  "Circumcision did not become a common medical procedure in the Anglophone world until the late 19th century . At that time , British and American doctors began recommending it primarily as a deterrent to masturbation . Prior to the 20th century , masturbation was believed to be the cause of a wide range of physical and mental illnesses including epilepsy , paralysis , impotence , gonorrhea , tuberculosis , feeblemindedness , and insanity . In 1855 , motivated in part by an interest in promoting circumcision to reduce masturbation , English physician Jonathan Hutchinson published his findings that Jews had a lower prevalence of certain venereal diseases . While pursuing a successful career as a general practitioner , Hutchinson went on to advocate circumcision for health reasons for the next fifty years , and eventually earned a knighthood for his overall contributions to medicine . In America , one of the first modern physicians to advocate the procedure was Lewis Sayre , a founder of the American Medical Association . In 1870 , Sayre began using circumcision as a purported cure for several cases of young boys diagnosed with paralysis or significant motor problems . He thought the procedure ameliorated such problems based on a \" reflex neurosis \" theory of disease , which held that excessive stimulation of the genitals was a disturbance to the equilibrium of the nervous system and a cause of systemic problems . The use of circumcision to promote good health also fit in with the germ theory of disease during that time , which saw the foreskin as being filled with infection @-@ causing smegma ( a mixture of shed skin cells and oils ) . Sayre published works on the subject and promoted it energetically in speeches . Contemporary physicians picked up on Sayre 's new treatment , which they believed could prevent or cure a wide @-@ ranging array of medical problems and social ills . Its popularity spread with publications such as Peter Charles Remondino 's History of Circumcision . By the turn of the century , in both America and Great Britain , infant circumcision was near universally recommended .",

  "During 632 or 633 Edwin of Northumbria , with his centre of Christian power north of the River Humber , was overthrown . Edwin was slain and Northumbria was ravaged by Cadwallon ap Cadfan , supported by the Mercian king , Penda . The Mercians then turned on the kingdom of the East Angles and their king , Ecgric . At an unknown date ( possibly in the early 640s ) , they routed the East Anglian army and Ecgric and his predecessor Sigeberht were both slain . D. P. Kirby has suggested that as Sigeberht was alive when the Irish monk Fursey left for Gaul and found Erchinoald , ( which happened after Erchinoald became Mayor of the Neustrian palace in 641 ) , Sigeberht was probably killed around 640 or 641 . Penda 's victory marked the end of the line of kings of the East Angles who were directly descended from Rædwald . Some time after Penda 's victory , Anna became king of the East Angles , though the date of his accession is quite uncertain . The Liber Eliensis says that Anna died in the nineteenth year of his reign , and since he died in the mid @-@ 650s this would indicate a date around 635 . However , the Liber Eliensis is regarded by some historians as unreliable on this point , and Barbara Yorke suggests a possible date in the early 640s for Anna 's accession , noting that it could not have been after 645 as Anna is recorded as giving refuge to Cenwalh of Wessex in that year . It is probable that Anna became king with the assistance of the northern Angles . Throughout his reign he was the victim of Mercian aggression under Penda , but he also seems to have challenged the rise of Penda 's power . The British medievalist David Dumville has written that due to their rivalry for control over the Middle Anglian people , Mercia and East Anglia probably became hereditary enemies and Penda repeatedly attacked the East Angles from the mid @-@ 630s to 654 .",

The shell is actively closed using the adductor muscle or muscles which are attached to the inner surface of both valves . The position of the muscles is often clearly visible on the inside of empty valves as circular or oval muscle scars . Along the hinge line of the shell are , in most cases , a number of hinge teeth which prevent the valves from moving laterally relative to one another .

Although a government investigation found that Zbor was guilty of high treason for accepting German funds , the authorities were careful not to arrest Ljotić in order to not provoke the Germans . Ljotić was placed under government surveillance but authorities quickly lost track of him . He hid with friends in Belgrade and remained in contact with Nedić and Velimirović . On 6 November , Nedić resigned from his post to protest the government crackdown on Zbor . Additional issues of Bilten continued to be printed despite his resignation . These supported a pro @-@ Axis Yugoslav foreign policy , criticized the government 's tolerance of Jews and Freemasons and attacked pro @-@ British members of the government for their opposition to Yugoslavia signing the Tripartite Pact .

  "Notre Dame had the worst start to their season in program history , opening 0 – 5 ( the previous record was 0 – 3 ) and headed into their game with USC at 1 – 6 .

  "The Greek philosopher Zeno considered the problem of summing an infinite series to achieve a finite result , but rejected it as an impossibility : the result was Zeno 's paradox . Later , Aristotle proposed a philosophical resolution of the paradox , but the mathematical content was apparently unresolved until taken up by Archimedes , as it had been prior to Aristotle by the Presocratic Atomist Democritus . It was through Archimedes 's method of exhaustion that an infinite number of progressive subdivisions could be performed to achieve a finite result . Liu Hui independently employed a similar method a few centuries later .",
  "Utricularia inflata , commonly known as the swollen bladderwort , inflated bladderwort , or large floating bladderwort , is a large suspended aquatic carnivorous plant that belongs to the genus Utricularia . It is a perennial that is native to the southeastern coastal plains of the United States . It has often been confused with U. radiata , which is similar but smaller than U. inflata . Since 1980 , U. inflata has been reported to exist in locations beyond its traditional range , such as the Adirondack Mountains in New York , southeastern Massachusetts , and in Washington State . Studies on the populations in the Adirondacks suggest that an introduction of U. inflata to a location where it naturalizes can lead to altered sediment chemistry by reducing the net primary productivity of native species . It is also listed by the state of Washington as a problematic species because of the dense mat @-@ forming habit of this aquatic Utricularia . It is one of the few carnivorous plants that can be invasive .",

  "While the Belyayev circle remained a nationalistic school of composition , its exposure to Tchaikovsky and his music made it more readily amenable to Western practices of composition , producing works that were a synthesis of nationalist tradition and Western technique . Overall , however , the degree of influence Tchaikovsky 's music had on the Belyayev composers was short @-@ lived . They generally continued stylistically from where The Five stopped , falling back on clichés and mannerisms taken from the works of Rimsky @-@ Korsakov and Balakirev . Even in the case of Glazunov , who was deeply influenced by Tchaikovsky 's music when he wrote his Third Symphony , the shadow of Tchaikovsky would become less prevalent with his subsequent symphonies , and he would reconcile it , along with the earlier influences of Balakirev , Borodin and Rimsky @-@ Korsakov , into an eclectic mature style . This eclecticism , according to musicologist Boris Schwarz , would effectively rob Glazunov 's music of \" the ultimate stamp of originality \" , and its academicism would tend to overpower Glazunov 's inspiration .

  "The brief orchestral prelude to Part I introduces the two contrasting moods which pervade the entire work . Kemp likens the opening \" snarling trumpet triad \" to \" a descent into Hades \" , but it is answered immediately by a gently mournful phrase in the strings . In general the eight numbers which comprise this first part each have , says Gloag , their own distinct texture and harmonic identity , often in a disjunctive relationship with each other , although the second and third numbers are connected by an orchestral \" interludium \" .

  "The alkali metals all have the same crystal structure ( body @-@ centred cubic ) and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms , since density is defined as mass per unit volume . The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius , which increases going down the group ; thus , the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group . The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group . Thus , the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii ; if figures for these two factors are known , the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated . The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table , with an exception at potassium . Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods , the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table .

The zonari is a rounded material of indeterminate length around 2 or 3 meters long and is wrapped multiple times when worn . From interviews conducted during the 1980s , Welters found that the technique was practiced by elderly women and regarded as a specialized skill which they worked on pairs of beams . Their vocabulary had no special term to correspond with sprang , so they referred to it with descriptive phrases such as knitting with sticks , plaiting , and weaving without passing through . The zonari are made from sheep 's wool hand spun with a drop spindle and dyed red , blue , or black depending on local custom .

The two intervening arias , and finally the chorale , reflect upon and extend their statements . \" Christoph Wolff assumes that the text was written for Bach 's 1724 cycle of chorale cantatas by the same librettist .",

  "The gray wolf is a social animal , whose basic social unit consists of a mated pair , accompanied by the pair 's adult offspring . The average pack consists of a family of 5 – 11 animals ( 1 – 2 adults , 3 – 6 juveniles and 1 – 3 yearlings ) , or sometimes two or three such families , with exceptionally large packs consisting of 42 wolves being known . In ideal conditions , the mated pair produces pups every year , with such offspring typically staying in the pack for 10 – 54 months before dispersing . Triggers for dispersal include the onset of sexual maturity and competition within the pack for food . The distance travelled by dispersing wolves varies widely ; some stay in the vicinity of the parental group , while other individuals may travel great distances of 390 km , 206 km , and 670 km from their natal packs . A new pack is usually founded by an unrelated dispersing male and female , travelling together in search of an area devoid of other hostile packs . Wolf packs rarely adopt other wolves into their fold , and typically kill them . In the rare cases where other wolves are adopted , the adoptee is almost invariably an immature animal ( 1 – 3 years of age ) unlikely to compete for breeding rights with the mated pair . In some cases , a lone wolf is adopted into a pack to replace a deceased breeder . During times of ungulate abundance ( migration , calving etc . ) , different wolf packs may temporarily join forces .",

  "Condoms made from sheep intestines , labeled \" lambskin \" , are also available . Although they are generally effective as a contraceptive by blocking sperm , it is presumed that they are likely less effective than latex in preventing the transmission of agents that cause STDs , because of pores in the material .

Per Li Shimin 's plan , the Tang troops did not come forth to deploy for battle ; instead they remained in their strong defensive positions , waiting for the Xia army to tire and begin its withdrawal . Then the Tang , according to Graff , \" would rush out and fall upon the by now demoralized and disorganized Xia army \" . This conformed to Li Shimin 's usual blueprint , which he had already employed to prevail over Xue Rengao and Liu Wuzhou : the Tang prince let the enemy advance , stretching their supply lines , and chose a suitable , highly defensible position where to confront them ; he avoided a direct confrontation , instead launching raids on his opponent 's supply lines , awaiting either signs of weakness or the beginning of a retreat ; he then launched an all @-@ out attack aiming at a crushing battlefield success , which he rendered decisive by following it up with a \" relentless cavalry pursuit \" , in Graff 's words , to exploit it and bring about the collapse of his opponent 's entire regime .",

A player who does not get a chance to spend their DKP accumulates it between raids and is able to spend it in the future . These points , while earned and spent like currency , are not the same thing as the virtual currency provided by the game company for the virtual world .

  "Tchaikovsky 's music remained popular in Russia as well as abroad , and his scholarly prowess was admired by the Belyayev circle ; however , these composers chose not to emulate his style .

  "The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes . Moreover , the practicality of the method it describes has been called into question , due to the extreme accuracy with which one would have to measure the water displacement . Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in hydrostatics as Archimedes ' principle , which he describes in his treatise On Floating Bodies . This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces . Using this principle , it would have been possible to compare the density of the golden crown to that of solid gold by balancing the crown on a scale with a gold reference sample , then immersing the apparatus in water . The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly . Galileo considered it \" probable that this method is the same that Archimedes followed , since , besides being very accurate , it is based on demonstrations found by Archimedes himself . \" In a 12th @-@ century text titled Mappae clavicula there are instructions on how to perform the weighings in the water in order to calculate the percentage of silver used , and thus solve the problem .

  "The colt arrived at Churchill Downs in Louisville , Kentucky , on April 28 , 2014 , and was one of the last Derby contenders to arrive . He was flown in from California , his first time on a plane , and traveled quietly . Once the plane landed , however , his travel idiosyncrasy was discovered by the waiting press when he refused to be unloaded until he was turned around and backed down the ramp ; Alan Sherman explained later that this was also his typical manner of egress from ground @-@ based transportation . Upon arrival at Churchill Downs , the horses entered in the Kentucky Derby each were given a special saddle cloth to wear while exercising on the track , identifying them as Derby contenders and including their name . The one given to California Chrome contained a typographical error , with California misspelled as \" Califorina \" . He wore it the first day and then the track management obtained one with the correct spelling . Critics commented that bringing the horse in late and not giving him a full workout on the track was a mistake , but Sherman 's strategy was backed by Lukas . In the days leading up to the race , California Chrome galloped on the track , was walked in the saddling paddock , and schooled at the starting gate . Willie Delgado later remarked that the horse did not particularly like that particular track , saying \" he never actually felt comfortable on it . \"",

While the pro @-@ slavery faction was in power , laws were passed permitting anyone to seize and return slaves who were more than ten miles from their home , and a one hundred dollar fine was placed on anyone who helped a slave escape . Some slaves , like \" Aunt Fannie \" , who belonged to Dennis Pennington , refused to be set free . Pennington had freed all his slaves when he left Virginia , but Fannie did not want to be left behind and continued on as a free household servant for the rest of her life .

  "A rare excursion from the opera house came in 1903 with Massenet 's only piano concerto , on which he had begun work while still a student . The work was performed by Louis Diémer at the Conservatoire , but made little impression compared with his operas . In 1905 Massenet composed Chérubin , a light comedy about the later career of the sex @-@ mad pageboy Cherubino from Mozart 's The Marriage of Figaro . Then came two serious operas , Ariane , on the Greek legend of Theseus and Ariadne , and Thérèse , a terse drama set in the French Revolution . His last major success was Don Quichotte ( 1910 ) , which L 'Etoile called \" a very Parisian evening and , naturally , a very Parisian triumph \" . Even with his creative powers seemingly in decline he wrote four other operas in his later years – Bacchus , Roma , Panurge and Cléopâtre . The last two , like Amadis , which he had been unable to finish in the 1890s , were premiered after the composer 's death and then lapsed into oblivion .",

  "In the 1950s , the U.S. Congress , then the governing institution of the District of Columbia , undertook the Southwest D.C. urban renewal project , the first in the capital district and one of the earliest such programs in the nation . In 1946 , Congress passed the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act , which established the District of Columbia Redevelopment Land Agency ( RLA ) and provided legal authority to clear land and funds to spur redevelopment in the capital . Congress also gave the National Capital Planning Commission ( NCPC ) the authority to designate which land would be redeveloped , and how . The RLA was not funded , however , until passage of the Housing Act of 1949 . A 1950 study by the NCPC found that the small Southwest quarter of the city suffered from high concentrations of old and poorly maintained buildings , overcrowding , and threats to public health ( such as lack of running indoor water , sewage systems , electricity , central heating , and indoor toilets ) . Competing visions for the redevelopment ranged from renovation to wholesale leveling of neighborhoods , but the latter view prevailed as more likely to qualify for federal funding .

  "The 1s1 electron configuration of hydrogen , while superficially similar to that of the alkali metals ( ns1 ) , is unique because there is no 1p subshell . Hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron H + , or gain one to form the hydride ion H − . In the former case it resembles superficially the alkali metals ; in the latter case , the halogens , but the differences due to the lack of a 1p subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well . Group 14 is the best fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionization energy and electron affinity , but none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory . As an example of hydrogen 's unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size , the hydrogen ion is very small ( radius around 150 fm compared to the 50 – 220 pm size of most other atoms and ions ) and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules . Indeed , transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of acid @-@ base chemistry .

Hitler seemed to respond ; in his \" Reichstag \" speech on 30 January 1939 , he stated that he wanted a \" long peace \" . Chamberlain was confident that improvements in British defence since Munich would bring the dictator to the bargaining table . This belief was reinforced by a German official 's conciliatory speech welcoming Ambassador Henderson back to Berlin after an absence for medical treatment in Britain . Chamberlain responded with a speech in Blackburn on 22 February hoping that the nations would resolve their differences through trade , and was gratified when his comments were printed in German newspapers . With matters appearing to improve Chamberlain 's rule over the House of Commons was firm and he was convinced the government would \" romp home \" in a late @-@ 1939 election .",

When they arrived in Columbus , Governor David Tod surprised McKinley with a commission as second lieutenant in recognition of his service at Antietam . McKinley and his comrades saw little action until July 1863 , when the division skirmished with John Hunt Morgan 's cavalry at the Battle of Buffington Island . Early in 1864 , the Army command structure in West Virginia was reorganized , and the division was assigned to George Crook 's Army of West Virginia .

McKinley later said the combat there was \" as desperate as any witnessed during the war . \" Following the rout , the Union forces destroyed Confederate supplies and skirmished with the enemy again successfully .",

  "Ground deicing technologies are also developing , and a newer technology is infrared deicing . This is the transmission of energy by means of electromagnetic waves or rays . Infrared is invisible and travels in straight lines from the heat source to surfaces and objects without significantly heating the space ( air ) it passes through . When infrared waves strike an object , they release their energy as heat . This heat is either absorbed or reflected by the cooler surface . Infrared energy is continually exchanged between \" hot \" and \" cold \" surfaces until all surfaces have reached the same temperature ( equilibrium ) . The colder the surfaces , the more effective the infrared transfer from the emitter . This heat transfer mechanism is substantially faster than conventional heat transfer modes used by conventional deicing ( convection and conduction ) due to the cooling effect of the air on the deicing fluid spray .",

  "Most ants are univoltine , producing a new generation each year . During the species @-@ specific breeding period , new reproductives , females , and winged males leave the colony in what is called a nuptial flight . The nuptial flight usually takes place in the late spring or early summer when the weather is hot and humid . Heat makes flying easier and freshly fallen rain makes the ground softer for mated queens to dig nests . Males typically take flight before the females . Males then use visual cues to find a common mating ground , for example , a landmark such as a pine tree to which other males in the area converge . Males secrete a mating pheromone that females follow . Males will mount females in the air , but the actual mating process usually takes place on the ground . Females of some species mate with just one male but in others they may mate with as many as ten or more different males , storing the sperm in their spermathecae .",

  "However , near the end of development , time constraints led the Pickford brothers to sell Zippo Games to Rare , in which Zippo was renamed Rare Manchester . With Rare as their boss , morale dropped for the development staff , and eventually everyone left the company before the game could be completed , thus shutting Rare Manchester down .

On 29 October , the HVO decided to attack , as it considered the ARBiH had directly threatened the strategic Kupres plateau . The HVO launched its offensive , codenamed Operation Cincar ( Operacija Cincar ) , on 1 November .

  "Later writers would state that A Child of Our Time placed Tippett in the first rank of the composers of his generation , and most of the early reviews were favourable . Among these , The Times 's critic called the work \" strikingly original in conception and execution \" , and wrote that Tippett had succeeded quite remarkably in writing an effective tract for the times . A second Times review , written a few days after the premiere , suggested that the oratorio had articulated a key contemporary question : \" How is the conflict of the inevitable with the intolerable to be resolved ? \" It pointed to the hope expressed in the final spiritual , \" Deep River \" , and concluded that despite some weak passages the work created a successful partnership between art and philosophy . William Glock in The Observer was laudatory : \" The most moving and important work by an English composer for many years \" . Glock found that the spirituals suited the themes of the oratorio perfectly , and had been arranged \" with a profound sense of beauty \" .",

In April 1988 , the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo @-@ journalists . Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery . The interior floor of the Vorbunker was covered with a muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years . Old empty wine bottles were found on the floor of the kitchen and wine store room . Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children . At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker . However , the men could go no further than the mid @-@ landing , as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947 . After these inspections , work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex . The Vorbunker 's top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down . The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable . The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker ( which had been in the Chancellery gardens ) was occupied by a car park .",

  "The Latin cōnātus comes from the verb cōnor , which is usually translated into English as , \" to endeavor \" ; but the concept of the conatus was first developed by the Stoics ( 333 – 264 BCE ) and Peripatetics ( c . 335 BCE ) before the Common Era . These groups used the word ὁρμή ( hormê , translated in Latin by impetus ) to describe the movement of the soul towards an object , and from which a physical act results .

Her father was an Anglican cleric in London , with strong Puritan leanings , who felt strongly that clergy should be well educated and clashed with his superiors on this issue . Marbury 's repeated challenges to the Anglican authorities led to his censure and imprisonment several years before Anne was born ; in 1578 he was given a public trial , of which , during a period of house arrest , he made a transcript from memory . He later used this transcript to educate and amuse his children , he being the hero , and the Bishop of London being portrayed as a buffoon .

  "It then occurred to me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in the case of animals also ; and as animals usually breed much more quickly than does mankind , the destruction every year from these causes must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each species , since evidently they do not increase regularly from year to year , as otherwise the world would long ago have been crowded with those that breed most quickly . Vaguely thinking over the enormous and constant destruction which this implied , it occurred to me to ask the question , why do some die and some live ? And the answer was clearly , on the whole the best fitted live ... and considering the amount of individual variation that my experience as a collector had shown me to exist , then it followed that all the changes necessary for the adaptation of the species to the changing conditions would be brought about ...

  "Up until recently ( 2008 ) there were \" inadequately known and misunderstood type species belonging to the Cyclostome Bryozoan family Oncousoeciidae . \" ( Taylor , Zaton 2008 ) Modern research and experiments have been done using low @-@ vacuum scanning electron microscopy of uncoated type material to critically examine and perhaps revise the taxonomy of three genera belonging to this family , including Oncousoecia , Microeciella , and Eurystrotos . This method permits data to be obtained that would be difficult to recognize with an optical microscope . The valid type species of Oncousoecia was found to be Oncousoecia lobulata . This interpretation stabilizes Oncousoecia by establishing a type species that corresponds to the general usage of the genus . Fellow Oncousoeciid Eurystrotos is now believed to be not conspecific with O. lobulata , as previously suggested , but shows enough similarities to be considered a junior synonym of Oncousoecia . Microeciella suborbicularus has also been recently distinguished from O. lobulata and O. dilatans , using this modern method of low vacuum scanning , with which it has been inaccurately synonymized with in the past .

  "Because a repeated word or phrase , such as the ubiquitous ki ‘ ai ki roto in the Atua Matariri recitation , will skew the statistics of that text , phonetic frequencies are best compared using word lists ( considering each word individually ) rather than the full texts . Pozdniakov used a few basic correlations between Rapanui and rongorongo to help narrow down the possible phonetic values of the glyphs . For instance , the relative frequencies of rongorongo glyphs in initial , medial , and final position in a ligature presumably constrain their possible sound values to syllables with similar distributions within the lexicon . Syllables beginning with ng , for example , are more common at the ends of words than in initial position . The overall frequencies , and the patterns of doubling and reduplication , on the other hand , seem to associate arm glyphs specifically with vocalic syllables :",
