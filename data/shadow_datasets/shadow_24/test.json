  "In nuclear polyadenylation , a poly ( A ) tail is added to an RNA at the end of transcription . On mRNAs , the poly ( A ) tail protects the mRNA molecule from enzymatic degradation in the cytoplasm and aids in transcription termination , export of the mRNA from the nucleus , and translation . Almost all eukaryotic mRNAs are polyadenylated , with the exception of animal replication @-@ dependent histone mRNAs . These are the only mRNAs in eukaryotes that lack a poly ( A ) tail , ending instead in a stem @-@ loop structure followed by a purine @-@ rich sequence , termed histone downstream element , that directs where the RNA is cut so that the 3 ' end of the histone mRNA is formed .",
  "For the march itself , Gandhi wanted the strictest discipline and adherence to satyagraha and ahimsa .

  "Negative differential resistance devices are widely used to make electronic oscillators . In a negative resistance oscillator , a negative differential resistance device such as an IMPATT diode , Gunn diode , or microwave vacuum tube is connected across an electrical resonator such as an LC circuit , a quartz crystal , dielectric resonator or cavity resonator with a DC source to bias the device into its negative resistance region and provide power . A resonator such as an LC circuit is \" almost \" an oscillator ; it can store oscillating electrical energy , but because all resonators have internal resistance or other losses , the oscillations are damped and decay to zero . The negative resistance cancels the positive resistance of the resonator , creating in effect a lossless resonator , in which spontaneous continuous oscillations occur at the resonator 's resonant frequency .",

  "The Welsh also have a history of producing whisky , in a similar manner to other Celtic people such as the Irish or Scottish but on a smaller scale . Distillation began for commercial purposes before 1750 , by families who went on to emigrate to America and help found the Kentucky Whiskey industry . Always a niche industry , by the late 19th century , the main whisky production in Wales was at Frongoch near Bala , Gwynedd . The distillery was bought by Scottish whisky companies and closed in 1910 when they were attempting to establish brands in England . In 1998 the Welsh Whisky Company , now known as Penderyn , was formed and whisky production began at Penderyn , Rhondda Cynon Taf in 2000 . Penderyn single malt whisky was the first whisky commercially produced in Wales for a century and went on sale in 2004 . The company also produces Merlyn Cream Liqueur , Five Vodka and Brecon Gin .",
  "The Hebrew Bible , a religious interpretation of the traditions and early national history of the Jews , established the first of the Abrahamic religions , which are now practiced by 54 % of the world . Judaism guides its adherents in both practice and belief , and has been called not only a religion , but also a \" way of life , \" which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism , Jewish culture , and Jewish identity rather difficult . Throughout history , in eras and places as diverse as the ancient Hellenic world , in Europe before and after The Age of Enlightenment ( see Haskalah ) , in Islamic Spain and Portugal , in North Africa and the Middle East , India , China , or the contemporary United States and Israel , cultural phenomena have developed that are in some sense characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious . Some factors in this come from within Judaism , others from the interaction of Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings , others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community , as opposed to from the religion itself . This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish cultures unique to their own communities .",

  "Bede 's best @-@ known work is the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum , or An Ecclesiastical History of the English People , completed in about 731 . Bede was aided in writing this book by Albinus , abbot of St Augustine 's Abbey , Canterbury . The first of the five books begins with some geographical background , and then sketches the history of England , beginning with Caesar 's invasion in 55 BC . A brief account of Christianity in Roman Britain , including the martyrdom of St Alban , is followed by the story of Augustine 's mission to England in 597 , which brought Christianity to the Anglo @-@ Saxons . The second book begins with the death of Gregory the Great in 604 , and follows the further progress of Christianity in Kent and the first attempts to evangelise Northumbria . These ended in disaster when Penda , the pagan king of Mercia , killed the newly Christian Edwin of Northumbria at the Battle of Hatfield Chase in about 632 . The setback was temporary , and the third book recounts the growth of Christianity in Northumbria under kings Oswald of Northumbria and Oswy . The climax of the third book is the account of the Council of Whitby , traditionally seen as a major turning point in English history . The fourth book begins with the consecration of Theodore as Archbishop of Canterbury , and recounts Wilfrid 's efforts to bring Christianity to the kingdom of Sussex . The fifth book brings the story up to Bede 's day , and includes an account of missionary work in Frisia , and of the conflict with the British church over the correct dating of Easter . Bede wrote a preface for the work , in which he dedicates it to Ceolwulf , king of Northumbria . The preface mentions that Ceolwulf received an earlier draft of the book ; presumably Ceolwulf knew enough Latin to understand it , and he may even have been able to read it . The preface makes it clear that Ceolwulf had requested the earlier copy , and Bede had asked for Ceolwulf 's approval ; this correspondence with the king indicates that Bede 's monastery had excellent connections among the Northumbrian nobility .",

Andriambelomasina surrounded the compound with a stone wall and within it built three houses as residences for his children — two twin houses ( tranokambana ) set side by side named Mahandry ( \" knows how to wait \" ) and Tsararay ( \" has a good father \" ) , and a third named Manandraimanjaka ( \" has a father who rules \" ) — taking pains to illustrate through the names of these houses that he had no intention of usurping his father .

  "As only one of the electrons can be transferred from the QH2 donor to a cytochrome c acceptor at a time , the reaction mechanism of complex III is more elaborate than those of the other respiratory complexes , and occurs in two steps called the Q cycle . In the first step , the enzyme binds three substrates , first , QH2 , which is then oxidized , with one electron being passed to the second substrate , cytochrome c . The two protons released from QH2 pass into the intermembrane space . The third substrate is Q , which accepts the second electron from the QH2 and is reduced to Q. − , which is the ubisemiquinone free radical . The first two substrates are released , but this ubisemiquinone intermediate remains bound . In the second step , a second molecule of QH2 is bound and again passes its first electron to a cytochrome c acceptor . The second electron is passed to the bound ubisemiquinone , reducing it to QH2 as it gains two protons from the mitochondrial matrix . This QH2 is then released from the enzyme .",

Also like Hayes , Tilden was a hard @-@ money man and supported civil service reform . In accordance with the custom of the time , the campaign was conducted by surrogates , with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns . The poor economic conditions made the party in power unpopular and made Hayes suspect that he might lose the election . Both candidates focused their attention on the swing states of New York and Indiana , as well as the three southern states — Louisiana , South Carolina , and Florida — where Reconstruction governments still barely ruled , amid recurring political violence . The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and , to a lesser extent , the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of southern blacks . Democrats , for their part , trumpeted Tilden 's record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration .",
  "Stalin consulted with his frontline commanders and senior officers of the General Staff from 12 to 15 April 1943 . In the end he and the Stavka agreed that the Germans would probably target Kursk . Stalin believed the decision to defend would give the Germans the initiative , but Zhukov countered that the Germans would be drawn into a trap where their armoured power would be destroyed , thus creating the conditions for a major Soviet counteroffensive . They decided to meet the enemy attack by preparing defensive positions to wear out the German groupings before launching their own offensive . Preparation of defences and fortifications began by the end of April , and continued until the German attack in early July . The two @-@ month delay between the German decision to attack the Kursk salient and its implementation allowed the Red Army ample time to thoroughly prepare .",

  "In early March 1705 the Russian Field Marshal Boris Sheremetyev set up a meeting with the Saxon general Otto Arnold von Paykull in order to agree to a common course of action in the ensuing campaign . The basis for the strategy was a plan developed by Johann Patkul as early as 1703 , which envisioned a joint strike which would neutralize the Swedish army. von Paykull , inspired by Patkul 's blueprint , advocated it as a way to lure Charles and the main Swedish army out of Greater Poland eastward towards Brest @-@ Litovsk . This was to be accomplished by having the combined forces of the main Russian army under Ogilvy and von Paykull 's troops stationed at Brest , which would force Charles to meet them in battle . At the same time the main Saxon army would attack Charles from the rear by sweeping through Poland out of Saxony , ultimately catching the Swedish army exposed . The plan seemed rather daring to Patkul and he suggested that the allies should first crush Lewenhaupt 's army , before Ogilvy 's troops approached Charles . Otherwise Ogilvy 's rear would be threatened . A compromise was made between the two strategies and it was decided that Sheremetyev should engage Lewenhaupt at the same time as Ogilvy marched towards the strongly fortified city of Grodno . The belief was that there , behind fortifications , Oglivy would be able to withstand Charles long enough for the main Saxon army to arrive from Kraków .

  "Puri is in the coastal delta of the Mahanadi River on the shores of the Bay of Bengal . In the ancient days it was near to Sisupalgarh ( also known as \" Ashokan Tosali \" ) . Then the land was drained by a tributary of the Bhargavi River , a branch of the Mahanadi River . This branch underwent a meandering course creating many arteries altering the estuary , and formed many sand hills . These sand hills could not be cut through by the streams . Because of the sand hills , the Bhargavi River , flowing to the south of Puri , moved away towards the Chilika Lake . This shift also resulted in the creation of two lagoons , known as Sar and Samang , on the eastern and northern parts of Puri respectively .

  "Midshipman David Casey was an experienced junior officer who had distinguished himself to Captain Pigot during the previous months , but his disrating was one of the primary triggers to the mutiny . About a week before the mutiny , Casey was at his station on the main top , and the captain noticed that a gasket , one of the ties that held the sail securely , had not been tied by one of the sailors under his supervision . Casey was brought before the captain , and apologised for the oversight and took responsibility for it . The captain demanded that Casey apologise on his knees , a completely unacceptable and debasing demand for a gentleman . Casey refused to be humiliated in such a way . Pigot offered him one more opportunity and when Casey once more refused , the captain ordered that Casey receive 12 lashes ( more commonly a sailor 's punishment than that of a junior officer ) , and he was disrated , which would effectively end his career as a naval officer . Casey was a popular officer amongst the crew and they felt that he was punished unfairly . The topmen began to plot mutiny .",
  "During the 15th century , Vlad III ( \" Dracula \" ) , Prince of Wallachia , is credited as the first notable figure to prefer this method of execution during the late medieval period , and became so notorious for its liberal employment that among his several nicknames he was known as Vlad the Impaler . After being orphaned , betrayed , forced into exile and pursued by his enemies , he retook control of Wallachia in 1456 . He dealt harshly with his enemies , especially those who had betrayed his family in the past , or had profited from the misfortunes of Wallachia . Though a variety of methods was employed , he has been most associated with his use of impalement . The liberal use of capital punishment was eventually extended to Saxon settlers , members of a rival clan , and criminals in his domain , whether they were members of the boyar nobility or peasants , and eventually to any among his subjects that displeased him . Following the multiple campaigns against the invading Ottoman Turks , Vlad would never show mercy to his prisoners of war .

  "Fighting throughout the front did not cease entirely for the rest of the day , most of it taking part around the besieged Israeli defences and strongpoints that still resisted . Meanwhile , the Sa 'iqa units airdropped into Sinai the previous day began engaging Israeli reserves heading for the front . The main areas of operation were the central mountain passes , the northern coastal routes , and near the Gulf of Suez . One battalion , transported in 18 helicopters , captured the Ras Sidr Pass south of Port Tawfiq , near the Gulf of Suez . En route four helicopters were shot down , but the survivors , including 9 crewmen , managed to regroup with the rest of the battalion . It held its position for the remainder of the war under extremely difficult conditions , preventing Israeli reserves from using the pass to reach the front . Two companies attempted to establish themselves in central Sinai , between Tasa and Bir Gifgafa . Israeli air interdiction resulted in six helicopter making a forced landing after being hit , while two helicopters turned and withdrew . The forced landings incurred many casualties , particularly due to burns , and the survivors trekked their way back to friendly lines . Only four helicopters reached the designated landing zone , and they could not be flown once more , indicating the suicidal nature of these operations . Albeit a third of their original force , the Sa 'iqa managed to block Israeli reserves for over eight hours .

  "Plant spirals can be seen in phyllotaxis , the arrangement of leaves on a stem , and in the arrangement ( parastichy ) of other parts as in composite flower heads and seed heads like the sunflower or fruit structures like the pineapple and snake fruit , as well as in the pattern of scales in pine cones , where multiple spirals run both clockwise and anticlockwise . These arrangements have explanations at different levels – mathematics , physics , chemistry , biology – each individually correct , but all necessary together . Phyllotaxis spirals can be generated mathematically from Fibonacci ratios : the Fibonacci sequence runs 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 ... ( each subsequent number being the sum of the two preceding ones ) . For example , when leaves alternate up a stem , one rotation of the spiral touches two leaves , so the pattern or ratio is 1 / 2 .

  "Besides the problems of the partial aether @-@ dragging hypothesis , another major problem arose with the Michelson – Morley experiment ( 1887 ) . In Fresnel 's theory , the aether is almost stationary , so the experiment should have given a positive result . However , the result of this experiment was negative . Thus from the viewpoint of the aether models at that time , the experimental situation was contradictory : On one hand , the aberration of light , the Fizeau experiment and the repetition by Michelson and Morley in 1886 appeared to support partial aether @-@ dragging . On the other hand , the Michelson – Morley experiment of 1887 appeared to prove that the aether is at rest with respect to Earth , apparently supporting the idea of complete aether @-@ dragging ( see aether drag hypothesis ) . So the very success of Fresnel 's hypothesis in explaining Fizeau 's results helped lead to a theoretical crisis , which was not resolved until the development of the theory of special relativity .",

A Red C poll commissioned by Paddy Power in January 2011 showed that Norris was by far the most popular choice for President with more than double the support of any of the other potential candidates . On 14 March 2011 Norris formally launched his campaign to secure a nomination , stating that he had written to the chairpersons of each of the 34 county and city councils and that he would also be individually contacting the independent TDs elected to the 31st Dail . On 21 July Norris revealed that he had secured the support of 13 Oireachtas members for his candidacy , and was confident of securing 20 . On 22 July two more senators announced they would back him . However , on 2 August , Norris publicly announced at a press conference that he was withdrawing from the presidential race . This followed the decision of three of his backers , the TDs John Halligan , Finian McGrath and Thomas Pringle to withdraw their support following revelations that Norris had written a letter to a court asking clemency for his former partner Ezra Nawi , who was then on trial in Israel . This information was publicised on 24 July by John Connolly , a Zionist blogger in London , who claimed he had received a tip @-@ off from an associate he admitted may have been a supporter of Norris 's campaign rival and eventual election winner Michael D. Higgins . Norris withdrew his candidacy on 2 August due to the controversy . Nawi , a human rights campaigner and pacifist who has been jailed for several short spells for his activism , suggested at the time that his deeds were being \" recycled \" against him and those associated with him . However , by 15 September , media reports indicated Norris was seeking to re @-@ enter the election , and was meeting independent TDs looking for their support . By 25 September , 18 members of the Oireachtas had signed Norris 's nomination papers . Then Mattie McGrath TD indicated that he would not be signing Norris 's nomination papers following a meeting with his supporters . This effectively ended the attempt to gain nomination through the Oireachtas , although Michael Lowry TD stated he would give the final required nomination if Norris acquired 19 nominations .",
  "Le Pen 's campaign for the upcoming presidential election unofficially began in the months following the 1986 election . To promote his statesmanship credentials , he made trips to South East Asia , the United States , and Africa . The management of the formal campaign , launched in April 1987 , was entrusted to Bruno Mégret , one of the new notables . With his entourage , Le Pen traversed France for the entire period and , helped by Mégret , employed an American @-@ style campaign . Le Pen 's presidential campaign was highly successful ; no candidates came close to rival his ability to excite audiences at rallies and boost ratings at television appearances . Using a populist tone , Le Pen presented himself as the representative of the people against the \" gang of four \" ( RPR , UDF , PS , Communist Party ) , while the central theme of his campaign was \" national preference \" . In the 1988 presidential election , Le Pen won an unprecedented 14 @.@ 4 % of the vote , and double the votes from 1984 .",

  "At the bottom of society were the \" masterless men \" and women ( who lacked a clear social relationship with a social superior , such as service or apprenticeship ) the unemployed and vagrants , whose numbers were swelled in times of economic downturn or hardship . Masterless women may have made up as much as 18 per cent of all households and particularly worried authorities . In rural society those that needed relief from extreme hardship tended from the lowest ranks of rural society , including cottars , labourers and servants . Most of those who took to the roads , around three quarters , were men . Most had a disability such as blindness , or claimed to have suffered a personal disaster such as fire or theft . Some were discharged soldiers and sailors , probably returning home or searching for work . Most tended to move around a restricted area , probably moving between a limited number of parishes in search of work and relief . For some this may have been tied to the agricultural calendar , and individuals may have moved in a circuit as different foodstuffs and work became available . Poor relief was more abundant in urban centres , particularly in the largest centres like Edinburgh . As a result , particularly in times of extreme hardship the poor would gravitate to the burghs . They could form a large section of society , with roughly a quarter of population of Perth in 1584 being classified as poor . The poor in urban society were a diverse group , the largest numbers women and most of those were widows .

  "A second influence on Durkheim 's view of society beyond Comte 's positivism was the epistemological outlook called social realism . Although he never explicitly exposed it , Durkheim adopted a realist perspective in order to demonstrate the existence of social realities outside the individual and to show that these realities existed in the form of the objective relations of society . As an epistemology of science , realism can be defined as a perspective that takes as its central point of departure the view that external social realities exist in the outer world and that these realities are independent of the individual 's perception of them . This view opposes other predominant philosophical perspectives such as empiricism and positivism . Empiricists such as David Hume had argued that all realities in the outside world are products of human sense perception . According to empiricists , all realities are thus merely perceived : they do not exist independently of our perceptions , and have no causal power in themselves . Comte 's positivism went a step further by claiming that scientific laws could be deduced from empirical observations . Going beyond this , Durkheim claimed that sociology would not only discover \" apparent \" laws , but would be able to discover the inherent nature of society .",

  "Leibniz , and some more recent philosophers , challenged the theory because it seems to entail that God 's goodness consists of his following his own commands . It is argued that , if divine command theory is accepted , God 's obligations would be what he commanded himself to do ; the concept of God commanding himself is seen as incoherent . Neither could God hold any virtues , as a virtue would be the disposition to follow his own commands – if he cannot logically command himself , then he cannot logically have any virtues . Edward Wierenga counters this by claiming that whatever God chooses to do is good , but that his nature means that his actions would always be praiseworthy . William Wainwright argues that , although God does not act because of his commands , it is still logical to say that God has reasons for his actions . He proposes that God is motivated by what is morally good and , when he commands what is morally good , it becomes morally obligatory .",

Keats does refer to Troilus and Cressida in the context of the \" sovereign power of love \" and Wordsworth translated some of Chaucer but , as a rule , love was portrayed in ways far different from how it is in the Troilus and Cressida story . Boitani sees the two World Wars and the 20th century 's engagement \" in the recovery of all sorts of past myths \" as contributing to a rekindling of interest in Troilus as a human being destroyed by events beyond his control . Similarly Foakes sees the aftermath of one World War and the threat of a second as key elements for the successful revival of Shakespeare 's Troilus in two productions in the first half of the 20th century , and one of the authors discussed below names Barbara Tuchman 's The March of Folly : From Troy to Vietnam as the trigger for his wish to retell the Trojan war .",
  "Throughout the 1970s gay activism had significant successes . One of the first and most important was the \" zap \" in May 1970 by the Los Angeles GLF at a convention of the American Psychiatric Association ( APA ) . At a conference on behavior modification , during a film demonstrating the use of electroshock therapy to decrease same @-@ sex attraction , Morris Kight and GLF members in the audience interrupted the film with shouts of \" Torture ! \" and \" Barbarism ! \" They took over the microphone to announce that medical professionals who prescribed such therapy for their homosexual patients were complicit in torturing them . Although 20 psychiatrists in attendance left , the GLF spent the hour following the zap with those remaining , trying to convince them that homosexuals were not mentally ill . When the APA invited gay activists to speak to the group in 1972 , activists brought John E. Fryer , a gay psychiatrist who wore a mask , because he felt his practice was in danger . In December 1973 — in large part due to the efforts of gay activists — the APA voted unanimously to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual .",

  "A live production of Last of the Summer Wine , known informally as the \" summer season \" , was produced in Bournemouth in 1984 . While Bill Owen and Peter Sallis reprised their roles as Compo and Clegg , Brian Wilde chose not to take part because of personal differences with Owen . The show focused on the men 's interaction with Clegg 's new neighbour , Howard ( Kenneth Waller ) , and his wife , Pearl , played by a local actress . The first act built up to the appearance of Marina ( Jean Fergusson ) , who was in correspondence with Howard . At the end of the first act , Marina was revealed to be a blonde sexpot . Howard and Marina 's story line was partly based on an early subplot of the television show . In the first series , the librarian , Mr. Wainwright , was having a love affair with his married assistant , Mrs. Partridge . Despite their efforts to keep the plot a secret , especially from Mrs. Partridge 's husband , the trio of old men were well aware of the affair . The summer season reversed the roles : Howard became the married partner , and the challenge was to keep the affair secret from his wife .",

  "Low oxygen levels lead to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction , the tightening of small blood vessels in the lung to create an optimal distribution of blood through the lung . Persistently low oxygen levels causing chronic vasoconstriction leads to increased pressure on the pulmonary artery ( pulmonary hypertension ) , which in turn puts strain on the right ventricle , the part of the heart that pumps blood to the lungs . The right ventricle undergoes remodeling , becomes distended and is less able to remove blood from the veins . When this is the case , raised hydrostatic pressure leads to accumulation of fluid in the skin ( edema ) , and in more severe cases the liver and the abdominal cavity .",

  "The pituitary develops in the third week of embryogenesis from interactions between the diencephalon part of the brain and the nasal cavity . The brain cells secrete FGF @-@ 8 , Wnt5a and BMP @-@ 4 , and the oral cavity BMP @-@ 2 . Together , these cellular signals stimulate a group of cells from the oral cavity to form Rathke 's pouch , which becomes independent of the nasal cavity and develops into the anterior pituitary ; this process includes the suppression of production of a protein called Sonic hedgehog by the cells of Rathke 's pouch . The cells then differentiate further into the various hormone @-@ producing cells of the pituitary . This requires particular transcription factors that induce the expression of particular genes . Some of these transcription factors have been found to be deficient in some forms of rare combined pituitary hormone deficiencies ( CPHD ) in childhood . These are HESX1 , PROP1 , POU1F1 , LHX3 , LHX4 , TBX19 , SOX2 and SOX3 . Each transcription factor acts in particular groups of cells . Therefore , various genetic mutations are associated with specific hormone deficiencies . For instance , POU1F1 ( also known as Pit @-@ 1 ) mutations cause specific deficiencies in growth hormone , prolactin and TSH . In addition to the pituitary , some of the transcription factors are also required for the development of other organs ; some of these mutations are therefore also associated with specific birth defects .",

Parham said he had never spoken of the incident because he was never asked . The report was titled \" Documented History of the Incident which Occurred at Rosewood , Florida in January 1923 \" . Gary Moore , the investigative journalist who wrote the 1982 story in The St. Petersburg Times that reopened the Rosewood case , criticized demonstrable errors in the report .

They delivered the final report to the Florida Board of Regents and it became part of the legislative record .",
  "FES was initially introduced into the Nigerian market through importation in the 1940s . Guinness in Nigeria is made from locally sourced sorghum or maize that has been heavily roasted . Some Nigerian versions also contain wheat . The switch from malted barley was made in 1986 when the Nigerian government briefly banned imports of the grain . The use of sorghum and maize continues as it is a cheaper alternative than barley , which has to be imported , and it is less vulnerable to local currency fluctuations . The Nigerian breweries use high gravity brewing techniques to ferment sorghum and pale malt to 1090 OG . Beer writer Roger Protz describes the Nigerian product as \" strikingly different \" from the Irish brewed version .",

  "It took eight months for Enigma to build the physics behind the web @-@ based grapple and swing game mechanic . During early builds of the game , the motion was slower , but the development team sped up the movement , feeling it was truer to the character . The Sonic the Hedgehog series served as an inspiration for the game 's pace . Significant effort was put into creating the game 's visual style and making Spidy a relatable , charismatic character . Daniel Parente cited Limbo , Braid , and Patapon as influences for the game 's aesthetics . Comics and cartoons served as influences for Spidy 's design . The character was given a pair of large yellow eyes , which allowed the character to emote . Two of the legs were removed , bringing the total from eight to six , which Andrew McKerrow described as an effort to avoid triggering the fears of people with arachnophobia and \" make the character a little more friendly looking and little less creepy \" . It was only after making these changes to Spidy that the developers decided to make Spidy an extraterrestrial , as that would justify the character design 's deviations from regular spiders .",

  "The scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro @-@ level ( e.g. , cells ) to a planetary scale ( e.g. , biosphere ) phenomena . Ecosystems , for example , contain abiotic resources and interacting life forms ( i.e. , individual organisms that aggregate into populations which aggregate into distinct ecological communities ) . Ecosystems are dynamic , they do not always follow a linear successional path , but they are always changing , sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain successional stages of a forest . An ecosystem 's area can vary greatly , from tiny to vast . A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem , but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it . Several generations of an aphid population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf . Each of those aphids , in turn , support diverse bacterial communities . The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation , because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole . Some ecological principles , however , do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole , such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame .",

  "This is sometimes referred to as the driving point impedance because it is the impedance at the place in the network at which the external circuit is connected and \" drives \" it with a signal . In his paper , Foster describes how such a lossless rational function may be realised in two ways . Foster 's first form consists of a number of series connected parallel LC circuits . Foster 's second form of driving point impedance consists of a number of parallel connected series LC circuits . The realisation of the driving point impedance is by no means unique . Foster 's realisation has the advantage that the poles and / or zeroes are directly associated with a particular resonant circuit , but there are many other realisations .

  "According to the Azores High hypothesis , an anti @-@ phase pattern is expected to exist between the Gulf of Mexico coast and the Atlantic coast .

  "Legislation passed through the Parliament Act , without the consent of the Lords , is still considered primary legislation . The importance of this was highlighted Jackson v Attorney General , where the legality of the Parliament Act 1949 was questioned . The challenge asserted foremost that the 1949 Act was delegated rather than primary legislation , and that the 1911 Act had delegated power to the Commons . If this were the case , then the Commons could not empower itself through the 1949 Act without direct permission from the Lords . Since it was passed under the 1911 Act , it had never received the required consent of the Lords . However , the 1949 Act was found to be legal . The 1911 Act , it was concluded , was not primarily about empowering the Commons , but rather to restrict the ability of the Lords to affect legislation . This ruling also means that efforts to abolish the House of Lords ( a major constitutional change ) using the Act could be successful , although the issue was not directly addressed in the ruling .",

  "The story is set during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , a period of religious conflict in England . Not only was there the threat of a Catholic resurgence but there were also disputes within the Protestant Church . When Gonsales first encounters the Lunars he exclaims \" Jesu Maria \" , at which the Lunars fall to their knees , but although they revere the name of Jesus they are unfamiliar with the name Maria , suggesting that they are Protestants rather than Catholics ; Poole is of the same opinion : \" their lack of reaction to the name of Mary suggests that they have not fallen into the errors of the Catholic Church , despite some otherwise rather Catholic @-@ looking institutions on the moon \" . Beginning in the 1580s , when Godwin was a student at Oxford University , many publications criticising the governance of the established Church of England circulated widely , until in 1586 censorship was introduced , resulting in the Martin Marprelate controversy . Martin Marprelate was the name used by the anonymous author or authors of the illegal tracts attacking the Church published between 1588 and 1589 . A number of commentators , including Grant McColley , have suggested that Godwin strongly objected to the imposition of censorship , expressed in Gonsales 's hope that the publication of his account may not prove \" prejudicial to the Catholic faith \" . John Clark has suggested that the Martin Marprelate controversy may have inspired Godwin to give the name Martin to the Lunar 's god , but as a bishop of the Church of England it is perhaps unlikely that he was generally sympathetic to the Martin Marprelate position . Critics do not agree on the precise denomination of Godwin 's Lunars . In contrast with Clark and Poole , David Cressy argues that the Lunars falling to their knees after Gonsales 's exclamation ( a similar ritual takes place at the court of Irdonozur ) is evidence of \" a fairly mechanical form of religion ( as most of Godwin 's Protestant contemporaries judged Roman Catholicism ) \" .",

  "The ride of Revere , Dawes , and Prescott triggered a flexible system of \" alarm and muster \" that had been carefully developed months before , in reaction to the colonists ' impotent response to the Powder Alarm .

In addition to other express riders delivering messages , bells , drums , alarm guns , bonfires and a trumpet were used for rapid communication from town to town , notifying the rebels in dozens of eastern Massachusetts villages that they should muster their militias because over 500 regulars were leaving Boston .

  "The 1858 Atlantic hurricane season was one of only three Atlantic hurricane seasons on record in which every tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane ( the others were in 1852 and 1884 ) . The first hurricane was first observed over the northwestern Caribbean Sea on June 12 . The sixth and final storm was last noted on October 26 . These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic . Three tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously . Two of the cyclones have only a single known point in its track due to a sparsity of data . Operationally , another tropical cyclone was believed to have existed over the eastern Atlantic between September 17 and September 18 , but HURDAT – the official Atlantic hurricane database – excludes this system . However , in the absence of modern satellite and other remote @-@ sensing technologies , only cyclones that affected populated land areas or encountered ships at sea are currently known , so the actual total could be higher . An undercount bias of zero to four tropical cyclones per year between 1886 and 1910 has been estimated . Of the six known 1858 Atlantic cyclones , five were first documented in 1995 by Jose Fernandez @-@ Partagas and Henry Diaz .",
  "The environment inhabited by Spinosaurus is only partially understood , and covers a great deal of what is now northern Africa . The region of Africa Spinosaurus is preserved in dates from 112 to 97 million years ago . A 1996 study concluded from Moroccan fossils that Spinosaurus , Carcharodontosaurus , and Deltadromeus \" ranged across north Africa during the late Cretaceous ( Cenomanian ) . \" Those Spinosaurus that lived in the Bahariya Formation of what is now Egypt may have contended with shoreline conditions on tidal flats and channels , living in mangrove forests alongside similarly large dinosaurian predators Bahariasaurus and Carcharodontosaurus , the titanosaur sauropods Paralititan and Aegyptosaurus , crocodylomorphs , bony and cartilaginous fish , turtles , lizards , and plesiosaurs . In the dry season it might have resorted to preying on pterosaurs . This situation resembles that in the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America , which boasts up to five theropod genera over one tonne in weight , as well as several smaller genera ( Henderson , 1998 ; Holtz et al . , 2004 ) . Differences in head shape and body size among the large North African theropods may have been enough to allow niche partitioning as seen among the many different predator species found today in the African savanna ( Farlow & Pianka , 2002 ) .",

  "Charles Darwin 's grandfather Erasmus Darwin outlined a hypothesis of transmutation of species in the 1790s , and Jean @-@ Baptiste Lamarck published a more developed theory in 1809 . Both envisaged that spontaneous generation produced simple forms of life that progressively developed greater complexity , adapting to the environment by inheriting changes in adults caused by use or disuse . This process was later called Lamarckism . Lamarck thought there was an inherent progressive tendency driving organisms continuously towards greater complexity , in parallel but separate lineages with no extinction . Geoffroy contended that embryonic development recapitulated transformations of organisms in past eras when the environment acted on embryos , and that animal structures were determined by a constant plan as demonstrated by homologies . Georges Cuvier strongly disputed such ideas , holding that unrelated , fixed species showed similarities that reflected a design for functional needs . His palæontological work in the 1790s had established the reality of extinction , which he explained by local catastrophes , followed by repopulation of the affected areas by other species .",

  "The book presents case histories of all the twin @-@ pairs studied and the raw data from the analyses . Its last chapters put the results in the context of existing studies , and presented a new theory and model to explain the causes and continuance of the disorder .

The theory in the book was that many genes work together to dispose a person to the disorder under certain environmental pressures . The model provided no specific therapeutic insight , but was useful as a guideline for further study .",

  "Chamberlain had formed a close friendship with his cousin , Norman Chamberlain , who had also served on the City Council and who shared the future Prime Minister 's social ideals . In December 1917 , Norman Chamberlain was reported missing in action during the Battle of Cambrai , and in February 1918 , Norman 's body was found — a great blow to Neville Chamberlain , who described Norman as \" the most intimate friend I had \" .

Irish annals record an attack by the Picts on Orkney in 682 , which must have necessitated a large naval force : they also lost 150 ships in a disaster in 729 . Ships were also vital in the amphibious warfare in the Highlands and Islands and from the seventh century the Senchus fer n @-@ Alban indicates that Dál Riata had a ship @-@ muster system that obliged groups of households to produce a total of 177 ships and 2 @,@ 478 men . The same source mentions the first recorded naval battle around the British Isles in 719 and eight naval expeditions between 568 and 733 . The only vessels to survive from this period are dugout canoes , but images from the period suggest that there may have been skin boats ( similar to the Irish currach ) and larger oared vessels . The Viking raids and invasions of the British Isles were based on superior seapower . The key to their success , was a graceful , long , narrow , light , wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed . This shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only 3 feet ( 1 m ) deep and permitted beach landings , while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages . Longships were also double @-@ ended , the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around .",

  "In late 1833 Etty was commissioned by Williams @-@ Wynn to paint a portrait of two of his seven children . Preparing for a Fancy Dress Ball depicts Williams @-@ Wynn 's daughters Charlotte and Mary , dressing up in lavish Italian @-@ style costume . Although their dress is generally described as Italian , Dennis Farr 's 1958 biography of Etty speculates that elements of the costumes were possibly intended to be Russian , based on Charlotte 's headdress . The Italian @-@ style clothing likely represents the high level of interest in Italian culture in early 19th @-@ century England . The popularity of the style of music now known as bel canto , widely associated with Italy , was at its peak ; likewise , the Italian plays of William Shakespeare had become extremely popular in the period . Etty , who had spent a good deal of time in Venice and other Italian cities , would have been very familiar with Italian clothing designs , and the costumes worn by the Williams @-@ Wynn sisters closely resemble those of women in Venetian scenes painted by Etty , such as 1831 's Window in Venice , During a Fiesta . As art historian Leonard Robinson points out , despite the title the sisters are not in fact shown preparing for the ball , but are fully dressed . The style of the work reflects that of Thomas Lawrence , who had been Etty 's teacher in 1807 – 08 , as well as that of Joshua Reynolds , of whom Etty was a great admirer and of whose works Etty had often made copies as an exercise .",

  "When silver prices rose relative to gold as a reaction to the California Gold Rush , silver coinage was worth more than face value , and rapidly flowed overseas for melting . Despite vocal opposition led by Tennessee Representative ( and future president ) Andrew Johnson , the precious metal content of smaller silver coins was reduced in 1853 , allowing them to circulate . Until then , depositors of silver could choose to have their bullion struck into silver coins of any denomination of five cents or above ; the 1853 act lightened the silver coins from the half dime to the half dollar and eliminated the right of the depositor to have silver struck into those denominations . Depositors could still choose to have silver struck into dollar coins , but the high price of silver made it more profitable to use the bullion in other ways . So long as silver prices remained high , this effectively placed the United States on the gold standard .",

  "Following the monumental work Conversation in the Cathedral , Vargas Llosa 's output shifted away from more serious themes such as politics and problems with society .

Good quality animals have been produced out of crosses between Haflingers and both Arabians and Andalusians . British enthusiasts maintain a partbred registry for Haflinger crosses . In Germany , horses that are 75 percent Haflinger and 25 percent Arabian are popular and are called Arabo @-@ Haflingers . In Italy , where horse meat consumption is at the highest among all European Community members , Haflingers provide a large percentage of national production . Most are either bred specifically for meat production and slaughtered between the ages of 10 and 18 months , or as a result of health problems , or age . The Haflinger also produces the majority of the horse milk consumed in Germany .",

  "Since gluons carry color charge , they themselves are able to emit and absorb other gluons . This causes asymptotic freedom : as quarks come closer to each other , the chromodynamic binding force between them weakens . Conversely , as the distance between quarks increases , the binding force strengthens . The color field becomes stressed , much as an elastic band is stressed when stretched , and more gluons of appropriate color are spontaneously created to strengthen the field . Above a certain energy threshold , pairs of quarks and antiquarks are created . These pairs bind with the quarks being separated , causing new hadrons to form . This phenomenon is known as color confinement : quarks never appear in isolation . This process of hadronization occurs before quarks , formed in a high energy collision , are able to interact in any other way . The only exception is the top quark , which may decay before it hadronizes .",

  "The result of breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia , an excess of oxygen in body tissues . The body is affected in different ways depending on the type of exposure . Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure . Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure . Symptoms may include disorientation , breathing problems , and vision changes such as myopia . Prolonged exposure to above @-@ normal oxygen partial pressures , or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures , can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes , collapse of the alveoli in the lungs , retinal detachment , and seizures .

  "When the division returned to the lines in October , after another assignment in reserve , it moved to the Heartbreak Ridge sector recently vacated by the 2nd Infantry Division , where it was supported by the 3rd Infantry Division and 1st Cavalry Division . During this new deployment the division fought in the Battle for Heartbreak Ridge , to take an area of staging grounds for the Korean and Chinese armies .

The review argued that the vertebrate division relied on the presence of a vertebral column , \" a part of the organization of comparatively little importance in the economy \" ; it found the basis of the mollusca on \" the general softness of the body \" no better ; the choice of the presence of articulations no better either , in the third division ; while in the fourth it points out that while the echinoderms may fit well into the chosen scheme , it did not apply \" to the entozoa , zoophyta , and infusoria , which constitute by much the greatest portion of this division . \" But the review notes that \" the general distribution of the animal kingdom established by M.

In fact , the history of the Broadway musical can accurately be divided into what came before Oklahoma ! and what came after it . \" An innovation for its time in integrating song , character , plot and dance , Oklahoma ! would serve , according to Hischak , as \" the model for Broadway shows for decades \" , and proved a huge popular and financial success . Once it was well @-@ launched , what to do as an encore was a daunting challenge for the pair . Movie producer Sam Goldwyn saw Oklahoma ! and advised Rodgers to shoot himself , which according to Rodgers \" was Sam 's blunt but funny way of telling me that I 'd never create another show as good as Oklahoma ! \" As they considered new projects , Hammerstein wrote , \" We 're such fools . No matter what we do , everyone is bound to say , ' This is not another Oklahoma ! ' \"",

  "For printing , the mass production of paper for writing was already well established in China . The papermaking process had been perfected and standardized by the Han dynasty court eunuch Cai Lun ( 50 – 121 ) in 105 , and was in widespread use for writing even by the 3rd century . The Song dynasty was the world 's first government in history to issue paper @-@ printed money — the banknote ( see Jiaozi and Huizi ) .

  "Any goalkeeper who aggressively fouls an attacker in position to score can be charged with a penalty shot for the other team . The goalkeeper can also be temporarily ejected from the game for twenty seconds if they prevent a likely goal ( for example , by splashing ) . If the goalkeeper pushes the ball under the water in the 5 m ( 16 ft ) area , instead of being a free throw to the other team , it is a penalty . A penalty is also awarded to the other team if the goalkeeper pulls down from the crossbar of the goal to prevent a goal .",

  "Following research of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s , economists have reached a consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization . Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies , healthy fiscal policy , robust bank regulations , and strong legal protection of property rights . Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment , liberalizing domestic equity capital , and embracing capital outflows and short @-@ term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework . An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency in the eyes of both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity , greater savings at higher interest rates , and accelerated economic growth . If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency , it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops , which carry serious economic and social costs .",

Towards the end of the season , he scored 103 runs in 90 minutes against Kent , his only century that year , hitting several deliveries into the crowd ; The Times described the ball in this innings as \" soaring away like a bird \" .

Despite his lack of success in the Tests , Crawford was invited to tour Australia that winter even before the South African series was complete ; he suggested to the press that he might remain in Australia after the tour .",

  "Very little is known about the details of Maximus ' life prior to his involvement in the theological and political conflicts of the Monothelite controversy . Numerous Maximian scholars call substantial portions of the Maronite biography into question , including Maximus ' birth in Palestine , which was a common seventh century trope to discredit an opponent . Moreover , the exceptional education Maximus evidently received could not have been had in any other part of the Byzantine Empire during that time except for Constantinople , and possibly Caesarea and Alexandria . It is also very unlikely that anyone of low social birth , as the Maronite biography describes Maximus , could have ascended by the age of thirty to be the Protoasecretis of the Emperor Heraclius , one of the most powerful positions in the Empire . It is more likely that Maximus was born of an aristocratic family and received an unparalleled education in philosophy , mathematics , astronomy , etc . It is true , however , that Maximus did not study rhetoric as he himself notes in the prologue to his Earlier Ambigua to John , to which his lack of high stylistic by Byzantine standards attests . Nevertheless , for reasons not explained in the few autobiographical details to be gleaned from his texts , Maximus left public life and took monastic vows at the monastery of Philippicus in Chrysopolis , a city across the Bosporus from Constantinople ( later known as Scutari , the modern Turkish city of Üsküdar ) . Maximus was elevated to the position of abbot of the monastery . \" Theology without practice is the theology of demons \" . ( One of his most famous quotes )",

  "The Ming scholar most influential upon subsequent generations , however , was Wang Yangming ( 1472 – 1529 ) , whose teachings were attacked in his own time for their similarity to Chan Buddhism . Building upon Zhu Xi 's concept of the \" extension of knowledge \" ( 理學 or 格物致知 ) , gaining understanding through careful and rational investigation of things and events , Wang argued that universal concepts would appear in the minds of anyone . Therefore , he claimed that anyone – no matter their pedigree or education – could become as wise as Confucius and Mencius had been and that their writings were not sources of truth but merely guides that might have flaws when carefully examined .

  "Friedrich 's landscapes exercised a strong influence on the work of German artist Max Ernst ( 1891 – 1976 ) , and as a result other Surrealists came to view Friedrich as a precursor to their movement . In 1934 , the Belgian painter René Magritte ( 1898 – 1967 ) paid tribute in his work The Human Condition , which directly echoes motifs from Friedrich 's art in its questioning of perception and the role of the viewer . A few years later , the Surrealist journal Minotaure featured Friedrich in a 1939 article by critic Marie Landsberger , thereby exposing his work to a far wider circle of artists .
