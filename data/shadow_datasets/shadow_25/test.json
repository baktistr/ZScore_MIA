  "Amanita nothofagi mushrooms can be confused with A. australis if the warts have been washed off and the colour has been bleached . A reliable method to distinguish the two is to check for the presence of clamp connections at the bases of the basidia , which are present in A. australis and absent from A. nothofagi . Ridley notes that the type collection was made with a dark grey specimen , and later collectors who found browner specimens have had difficulty in correctly identifying the species . Paler specimens resemble A. excelsa , which led some to incorrectly believe that the species occurs in New Zealand . Amanita luteofusca is also similar in appearance , spore size , amyloid reaction , and lack of clamp connections in the basidia . It is distinguished from A. nothofagi largely on the basis of colour — it is a greyish @-@ brown to yellowish @-@ grey brown that fades to pinkish @-@ buff as it gets older . Tulloss suggests that the resemblance of a number of species from Australasia and Chile which lack brightly coloured fruit bodies and share similar greyish to brownish rings and volvas may indicate that they share Gondwanan ancestors .",

  "The scientific name of the sitatunga is Tragelaphus spekii . The species was first described by the English explorer John Hanning Speke in 1863 . Speke first observed the sitatunga at a lake named \" Little Windermere \" ( now Lake Lwelo , located in Kagera , Tanzania ) . In his book Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile , Speke called the animal \" nzoé \" ( Kiswahili name for the animal ) or \" water @-@ boc \" ( due to its resemblance to the waterbuck ) . The scientific name has often been misstated as T. spekei , and either Speke or Sclater is referred to as the binomial authority . Speke had stated in a footnote in his book that the species had been named Tragelaphus spekii by English zoologist Philip Sclater . However , according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( Article 50 @.@ 1 @.@ 1 ) and the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature , that acknowledge the person who first described the species , simply declaring Sclater as the authority in a footnote is insufficient to recognise him as the author . Hence , Speke was recognised as the correct authority and T. spekii ( where spekii is the genitive of the Latinised \" Spekius \" ) was considered the correct name for the species .",

The book included the \" fantastic tale \" that Anastasia escaped from Russia on a farm cart with a man called Alexander Tschaikovsky , whom she married and had a child by , before he was shot dead on a Bucharest street , and that the child , Alexei , disappeared into an orphanage .

  "According to authors such as Theodore Gatchel , during the interwar period the campaign \" became a focal point for the study of amphibious warfare \" in the United Kingdom and United States , because , as Glenn Wahlert points out , it involved \" all four types of amphibious operations : the raid , demonstration , assault and withdrawal \" . Russell Weigley has written that analysis of the campaign before World War II led to \" a belief among most of the armed forces of the world \" that amphibious assaults could not succeed against modern defences and that arguably this perception continued until the Normandy Landings in June 1944 despite some successful examples of amphibious operations earlier in the war , such as those in Italy , and at Tarawa and in the Gilbert Islands in the Pacific . Hart supports Weighley 's supposition , writing that although this negative perception prevailed amongst Allied planners in the interwar years , the war situation after 1940 meant that such operations had to be considered . He also argues that despite early successes in North Africa and Italy , it was not until Normandy that the belief that opposed landings could not succeed was completely excised .",

  "Increased densities of DRAM integrated circuits ( ICs ) have led to physically smaller memory cells capable of storing smaller charges , resulting in lower operational noise margins , increased rates of electromagnetic interactions between memory cells , and greater possibility of data loss . As a result , disturbance errors have been observed , being caused by cells interfering with each other 's operation and manifesting as random changes in the values of bits stored in affected memory cells . The awareness of disturbance errors dates back to the early 1970s and Intel 1103 as the first commercially available DRAM IC ; since then , DRAM manufacturers have employed various mitigation techniques to counteract disturbance errors , such as improving the isolation between cells and performing production testing . However , researchers proved in a 2014 analysis that commercially available DDR3 DRAM chips manufactured in 2012 and 2013 are susceptible to disturbance errors , while using the term row hammer to name the associated side effect that led to observed bit flips .",

Once the Hipparcos results were taken into account , it was found that Beta Pictoris was located close to the zero age main sequence and was not a pre – main sequence star after all . Analysis of Beta Pictoris and other stars within the Beta Pictoris moving group suggests that they are around 12 million years old . Allowing for uncertainties , the age may range between 8 and 20 million years .",

  "Most colonies are monogyne , meaning that a colony only has a single queen , but based on observations , some nests contain more than a single queen . Some nests are known to contain two queens , with some even having as many as four in a single colony , making them polygynous ; a high proportion of queens living in polygynous nests are unrelated to one another . Some colonies are oligogynous , which means that multiple queens are present in a colony , but they are tolerated by all workers birthed from different queens and treated equally . Tolerance still occurs even when new reproductive females and males are born , but recognition based on kin from queens and workers is known , hinting brood discrimination when the larvae are fed or groomed ; queens will only take care of their own brood and neglect to look after broods laid by other queens . The queens , on the other hand , will only cooperate with each other during nest founding , but will be antagonistic once there are workers present in the colony . Queens become more intolerant of each other as the colony grows , and eventually separate within the nest , resulting in the queen laying more eggs . Such cases usually happen when pleometrotic founding occurs , or if a queen ant is adopted by a colony , setting up aggressive relationships . Physical fights between queens in the same colony are rare .",

  "Barbaros Hayreddin returned to Constantinople on 11 March 1915 ; the Ottoman high command had decided that both ships were not needed at all times . Over the next several months , the two ships alternated trips to Constantinople . On 25 April , the two battleships bombarded the British landings on the first day of the Gallipoli Campaign . After firing fourteen shells , the fifteenth detonated in the right gun barrel in the center turret , destroying the gun . After a shell exploded inside one of Turgut Reis 's guns in early June , both battleships were withdrawn . On 7 August , the British landed more troops at Suvla Bay , prompting the high command to send Barbaros Hayreddin to support the Ottoman defenses there . In addition , she was loaded with a large quantity of ammunition to resupply the Fifth Army fighting in the Gallipoli Campaign . The next day , while she was en route to the area with only a single torpedo boat as escort , she was intercepted by the British submarine HMS E11 off Bolayır in the Sea of Marmara . The submarine hit Barbaros Hayreddin with a single torpedo ; she capsized seven minutes later , but remained afloat for a few minutes before she slipped below the waves . The ship sank with the loss of 21 officers and 237 men . The rest of the crew were picked up by her escort and a second torpedo boat patrolling the area .",

  "Many defections , however , were due to Strang 's seemingly abrupt \" about @-@ face \" on the turbulent subject of polygamy . Vehemently opposed to the practice at first , Strang reversed course in 1849 to become one of its strongest advocates , marrying five wives ( including his original spouse , Mary ) and fathering fourteen children . Since many of his early disciples viewed him as a monogamous counterweight to Brigham Young 's polygamous version of Mormonism , Strang 's decision to embrace plural marriage proved costly to him and his organization . Strang defended his new tenet by claiming that , far from enslaving or demeaning women , polygamy would liberate and \" elevate \" them by allowing them to choose the best possible mate based upon any factors deemed important to them — even if that mate were already married to someone else . Rather than being forced to wed \" corrupt and degraded sires \" due to the scarcity of more suitable men , a woman could marry the man she saw as the most compatible to herself , the best candidate to father her children and give her the finest possible life , no matter how many other wives he might have .",

  "Many waveguide filter components work by introducing a sudden change , a discontinuity , to the transmission properties of the waveguide . Such discontinuities are equivalent to lumped impedance elements placed at that point . This arises in the following way : the discontinuity causes a partial reflection of the transmitted wave back down the guide in the opposite direction , the ratio of the two being known as the reflection coefficient . This is entirely analogous to a reflection on a transmission line where there is an established relationship between reflection coefficient and the impedance that caused the reflection . This impedance must be reactive , that is , it must be a capacitance or an inductance . It cannot be a resistance since no energy has been absorbed — it is all either transmitted onward or reflected . Examples of components with this function include irises , stubs , and posts , all described later in this article under the filter types in which they occur .",

  "Its most noticeable effect is due to its first unique feature : flavor changing . A neutron , for example , is heavier than a proton ( its sister nucleon ) , but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavor ( type ) of one of its two down quarks to an up quark . Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing , so this proceeds by weak decay ; without weak decay , quark properties such as strangeness and charm ( associated with the quarks of the same name ) would also be conserved across all interactions . All mesons are unstable because of weak decay . In the process known as beta decay , a down quark in the neutron can change into an up quark by emitting a virtual W − boson which is then converted into an electron and an electron antineutrino . Another example is the electron capture , a common variant of radioactive decay , wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact , and are changed to a neutron ( an up quark is changed to a down quark ) and an electron neutrino is emitted .",

  "Rich Juzwiak noted that Beyoncé \" ecstatically and hyperactively \" changes keys six times during the entire song . As stated by Scott Shetler of PopCrush , she constantly sings praises of her love interest in the first verse where she also seemingly sends him subtle digs as he did not give her his full attention in the past , this being illustrated in lyrics such as , \" after fighting through my fears [ ... ] finally you 've put me first . \" The chorus , complimented with sweet backing harmonies , then arrives , with Beyoncé chanting , \" Baby it 's you , you 're the one I love / You 're the one I need / You 're the only one I see / Come on baby it 's you / You 're the one that gives your all / You 're the one I can always call / When I need you make everything stop / Finally you put my love on top . \" The chorus carries the final two minutes of the song through four key changes , proceeding to D ♭ , then to D , E ♭ and finally to E. This was highlighted by Henderson who wrote that \" the spirit carries both her and the song into a Stevie Wonder @-@ reminiscent climax of continually rising key changes . \" In this way , the word \" baby \" is said about 24 times throughout the song .

  "The opening years of the 1980s saw a number of changes in personnel and direction of established hard rock acts , including the deaths of Bon Scott , the lead singer of AC / DC , and John Bonham , drummer with Led Zeppelin . Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards , AC / DC pressed on , recording the album Back in Black ( 1980 ) with their new lead singer , Brian Johnson . It became the fifth @-@ highest @-@ selling album of all time in the US and the second @-@ highest @-@ selling album in the world . Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio , formerly of Rainbow , giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell ( 1980 ) . Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz ( 1980 ) , featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads . Some bands , such as Queen , moved away from their hard rock roots and more towards pop rock , while others , including Rush with Moving Pictures ( 1981 ) , began to return to a hard rock sound . The creation of thrash metal , which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982 , particularly by Metallica , Anthrax , Megadeth and Slayer , helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from hard rock , although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a hard rock sound . Kiss moved away from their hard rock roots toward pop metal : firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album , and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release , Animalize , both of which marked a return to commercial success . Pat Benatar was one of the first women to achieve commercial success in hard rock , with three successive Top 5 albums between 1980 and 1982 .",

Huggins decided in late October 1942 to join a unified Southern African Command headed by South Africa 's Jan Smuts . This choice was motivated by a combination of strategic concerns and geopolitical manoeuvring . Apart from considering South Africa a more appropriate partner in geographical , logistical and cultural terms , Huggins feared that the alternative — joining the British East Africa Command — might detract from the autonomous nature of Southern Rhodesia 's war effort , with possible constitutional implications . A shift in the deployment of the colony 's troops duly occurred .

  "\" Hush \" explores issues relating to the limits and benefits of language and communication . During the first act of the episode , the characters are presented as being overwhelmed by language that is misused , used as white noise , and employed as a means of avoiding truth . Many of the conversations between characters , even those that are seemingly insignificant to the episode 's plot or to the show 's overall history , deal in some way with various aspects or forms of communication . Whedon stated that he was unaware of how \" inevitably coherent \" this theme was until after the script was completed . Buffy and Riley are unable to act upon their attraction because they cannot stop babbling , primarily to keep their true identities concealed from each other , but also to avoid becoming closer emotionally . Xander is unable or unwilling to express what Anya means to him , and Anya , still new at interacting with humans , uses blunt , often rude language that distances herself from all the other characters .

  "Over the winter , there seems to have been some tension between the Allies . In particular , the Athenians , who were not protected by the isthmus , but whose fleet were the key to the security of the Peloponnesus , felt hard done by . They demanded an Allied army march north the following year . When the other Allies failed to commit to this , the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring . The navy , now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides , thus skulked off Delos , while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos , both sides unwilling to risk battle .

  "A vitamin is an organic compound and a vital nutrient that an organism requires in limited amounts . An organic chemical compound ( or related set of compounds ) is called a vitamin when the organism cannot synthesize the compound in sufficient quantities , and it must be obtained through the diet ; thus , the term \" vitamin \" is conditional upon the circumstances and the particular organism . For example , ascorbic acid ( one form of vitamin C ) is a vitamin for humans , but not for most other animal organisms .

  "A variety of topics in physics such as crystallography , metallurgy , elasticity , magnetism , etc . , were treated as distinct areas until the 1940s , when they were grouped together as solid state physics . Around the 1960s , the study of physical properties of liquids was added to this list , forming the basis for the new , related specialty of condensed matter physics . According to physicist Philip Warren Anderson , the term was coined by him and Volker Heine , when they changed the name of their group at the Cavendish Laboratories , Cambridge from \" Solid state theory \" to \" Theory of Condensed Matter \" in 1967 , as they felt it did not exclude their interests in the study of liquids , nuclear matter and so on . Although Anderson and Heine helped popularize the name \" condensed matter \" , it had been present in Europe for some years , most prominently in the form of a journal published in English , French , and German by Springer @-@ Verlag titled Physics of Condensed Matter , which was launched in 1963 . The funding environment and Cold War politics of the 1960s and 1970s were also factors that lead some physicists to prefer the name \" condensed matter physics \" , which emphasized the commonality of scientific problems encountered by physicists working on solids , liquids , plasmas , and other complex matter , over \" solid state physics \" , which was often associated with the industrial applications of metals and semiconductors . The Bell Telephone Laboratories was one of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed matter physics .",

  "During one period of rotation for PSR B1937 + 21 , there are two peaks observed , known as the pulse and interpulse . PSR B1937 + 21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse . Until 1995 , the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar , and by 2006 , there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses out of more than 1500 known pulsars . The giant pulses of PSR B1937 + 21 were first observed in 1984 , shortly after its discovery , but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937 + 21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed . In more recent follow up observations , more giant pulses have been found . These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse . The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar , lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds . The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable , but has been observed to be as high as 6 @.@ 5 × 10 − 22 Wm − 2Hz − 1 ( 6 @.@ 5 × 104 janskys ) .

As the Catholic Church holds that women cannot be validly ordained , women are not eligible for the papacy . Claims that there was a female pope , including the legendary Pope Joan , are fictitious . This tale began as a satire on the deplorable state of corruption in the College of Cardinals ; things were so bad , even a woman could be elected Pope . Though the pope is the Bishop of Rome , he need not be of Italian background . The current pope , Francis , is an Argentinian while his predecessor , Benedict XVI , is a German and before him was John Paul II , a Pole .",

  "She is one of the foundational works of fantasy literature , coming around the time of The Princess and the Goblin ( 1858 ) by George MacDonald , William Morris ' The Wood Beyond the World and The Well at the World 's End , and the short stories of Lord Dunsany . It is marked by a strong element of \" the marvelous \" in the figure of Ayesha , a two @-@ thousand @-@ year @-@ old sorceress , and the ' Spirit of the World ' , an undying fire that confers immortality . Indeed , Haggard 's story is one of the first in modern literature to feature \" a slight intrusion of something unreal \" into a very real world – a hallmark of the fantasy genre . Similarly , the carefully constructed \" fantasy history \" of She foreshadows the use of this technique that characterises later fantasies such as The Lord of the Rings and The Wheel of Time series , and which imparts a \" degree of security \" to the secondary world . However , the story of She is firmly ensconced in what fantasy theorists call ' primary world reality ' , with the lost kingdom of Kôr , the realm ruled by the supernatural She , a fantastic \" Tertiary World \" at once directly part of and at the same time indirectly set apart from normative \" primary \" reality . Along with Haggard 's prior novel , King Solomon 's Mines , She laid the blueprints for the \" Lost World \" subgenre in fantasy literature , as well as the convention of the \" lost race \" . As Brantlinger has noted of the novel 's importance to the development of the \" secondary world \" in fantasy literature : \" Haggard may seem peripheral to the development of science fiction , and yet his African quest romances could easily be transposed to other planets and galaxies \" . In his history of science fiction , Billion Year Spree , Brian Aldiss notes the frequency with which Ayesha 's death in the Pillar of Fire has been imitated by later science fiction and fantasy writers : \" From Haggard on , crumbling women , priestesses , or empresses – all symbols of women as Untouchable and Unmakeable – fill the pages of many a scientific romance \" .",

Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg , who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules , an early form of molecular replacement .",
  "At some point during his reign , Sigeberht abdicated his power to Ecgric and retired to lead a religious life within a monastery he had built for his own use .

  "\" Crucifixus \" ( Crucified ) , the enter of the Credo part , is the oldest music in the setting of the Mass , dating back to 1714 . It is a passacaglia , with the chromatic fourth in the bass line repeated thirteen times . Wenk likens it to the dance Sarabande . The movement is based on the first section of the first choral movement of Weinen , Klagen , Sorgen , Zagen , BWV 12 .

As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom , effectively creating a carbanion , organolithium compounds are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles . For use as bases , butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available . An example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium ( ( CH3Li ) x ) , which exists in tetrameric ( x",
  "Caesium fluoride enjoys niche use in organic chemistry as a base , or as an anhydrous source of fluoride ion . Caesium salts sometimes replace potassium or sodium salts in organic synthesis , such as cyclization , esterification , and polymerization . It has also been used in thermoluminescent radiation dosimetry ( TLD ) : When exposed to radiation , it acquires crystal defects that , when heated , revert with emission of light proportionate to the received dose . Thus , measuring the light pulse with a photomultiplier tube can allow the accumulated radiation dose to be quantified .",

  "Horses were known to humans on what is now the Iberian Peninsula as far back as 25 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 BC , as shown by cave paintings in the area . Among the local wild horses originally used by humans were the probable ancestors of the modern Lusitano , as studies comparing ancient and modern horse DNA indicate that the modern \" Lusitano C \" group contains maternal lineages also present in wild Iberian horses from the Early Neolithic period . These ancient horses were used for war , with clear evidence of their use by Phoenicians around 1100 BC and Celts around 600 BC . It is believed that these invaders also brought horses with them , contributing outside blood to the ancestry of the modern Iberian breeds . By 800 BC , the alliance known as Celtiberians had been formed by the Iberians and Celts , and from this point on the horses bred in this area were renowned as war horses . Xenophon , writing around 370 BC , admired the advanced horsemanship and riding techniques used by Iberian horsemen in war , made possible in part by their agile horses . Legend claimed that mares of the area were sired by the wind ( hence their amazing swiftness , passed onto their foals ) , and one modern hypothesis suggests that the bond between Iberian humans and horses was the initial inspiration for the centaur , which was believed to come from the area of the Tagus River .

  "Immigrating males often kill young infants when they take over a group . Females band together to defend their infants from infanticidal males , but they rarely succeed in saving their infants . Because infants inhibit their mothers from ovulating by nursing frequently , males are able to bring females into estrus earlier by killing the infants and thereby terminating nursing ; this has the effect of increasing their breeding opportunities . Females do often mate with the killers of their infants , and with time , they typically become as supportive of the new alpha male as they had been of the previous one . The alpha male helps defend females from subordinate males within the group as well as from infanticidal males from other groups .",

  "Opisthocoelicaudia / ɒˌpɪsθoʊsɪlᵻˈkɔːdiə / was a genus of sauropod dinosaur of the Late Cretaceous Period discovered in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia . The only species is Opisthocoelicaudia skarzynskii . A well @-@ preserved skeleton lacking only the head and neck was unearthed in 1965 by Polish and Mongolian scientists , making Opisthocoelicaudia one of the best known sauropods from the Late Cretaceous . Tooth marks on this skeleton indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs had fed on the carcass and possibly had carried away the now @-@ missing parts . To date , only two additional , much less complete specimens are known , including a part of a shoulder and a fragmentary tail .

Like other sauropods , it would have been characterised by a small head sitting on a very long neck and a barrel shaped trunk carried by four column @-@ like legs . The name Opisthocoelicaudia means \" posterior cavity tail \" , alluding to the unusual , opisthocoel condition of the anterior tail vertebrae that were concave on their posterior sides . This and other skeletal features lead researchers to propose that Opisthocoelicaudia was able to rear on its hindlegs .",

  "Various more specific conditioned shifts of vowel quality have also occurred . Diphthongs were frequently monopthongized , but the scope and results of this shift varied among dialects . In particular , the Samaria ostraca show / jeːn / < * / jajn / < * / wajn / for Southern / jajin / ( ' wine ' ) , and Samaritan Hebrew shows instead the shift * / aj / > / iː / . Original * / u / tended to shift to / i / ( e.g. אֹמֶר and אִמְרָה ' word ' ; חוץ ' outside ' and חיצון ' outer ' ) beginning in the second half of the second millennium BC . This was carried through completely in Samaritan Hebrew but met more resistance in other traditions such as the Babylonian and Qumran traditions . Philippi 's law is the process by which original * / i / in closed stressed syllables shifts to / a / ( e , g , / * bint / > בַּת / bat / ' daughter ' ) , or sometimes in the Tiberian tradition / ɛ / ( e.g. / * ʔamint / > אֱמֶת / ɛ ̆ mɛt / ' truth ' ) . This is absent in the transcriptions of the Secunda , but there is evidence that the law 's onset predates the Secunda . In the Samaritan tradition Philippi 's law is applied consistently , e.g. * / libː @-@ u / > / lab / ( ' heart ' ) . In some traditions the short vowel / * a / tended to shift to / i / in unstressed closed syllables : this is known as the law of attenuation . It is common in the Tiberian tradition , e.g. * / ʃabʕat / > Tiberian שִבְעָה / ʃivˈʕɔ / ( ' seven ' ) , but exceptions are frequent . It is less common in the Babylonian vocalization , e.g. / ʃabʕɔ / ( ' seven ' ) , and differences in Greek and Latin transcriptions demonstrate that it began quite late . Attenuation generally did not occur before / i ~ e / , e.g. Tiberian מַפְתֵּחַ / mafˈteaħ / ( ' key ' ) versus מִפְתַּח / mifˈtaħ / ( ' opening [ construct ] ' ) , and often was blocked before a geminate , e.g. מתנה ( ' gift ' ) . Attenuation is rarely present in Samaritan Hebrew , e.g. מקדש / maqdaʃ / . In the Tiberian tradition / e i o u / take offglide / a / before / h ħ ʕ / . This is absent in the Secunda and in Samaritan Hebrew but present in the transcriptions of Jerome . In the Tiberian tradition an ultrashort echo vowel is sometimes added to clusters where the first element is a guttural , e.g. יַאֲזִין / jaʔăzin / ( ' he will listen ' ) פָּעֳלוֹ / pɔʕɔ ̆ lo / ( ' his work ' ) but יַאְדִּיר / jaʔdið / ( ' he will make glorious ' ) רָחְבּוֹ / ʀɔħbo / ' its breadth ' .",

  "As the only sea route between the oil @-@ rich Black Sea and the Mediterranean , the Bosphorus is one of the busiest waterways in the world ; more than 200 million tonnes of oil pass through the strait each year , and the traffic on the Bosphorus is three times that on the Suez Canal . As a result , there have been proposals to build a canal , known as Canal Istanbul , parallel to the strait , on the European side of the city . Istanbul has three major shipping ports — the Port of Haydarpaşa , the Port of Ambarlı , and the Port of Zeytinburnu — as well as several smaller ports and oil terminals along the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara . Haydarpaşa , situated at the southeastern end of the Bosphorus , was Istanbul 's largest port until the early 2000s .

An interim award of £ 250 @,@ 000 was made , to allow the bid to be developed , but the application was rejected in November 2007 .

  "Ten years after finishing his translation , Tolkien gave a highly acclaimed lecture on the work , entitled \" Beowulf : The Monsters and the Critics \" , which had a lasting influence on Beowulf research . Lewis E. Nicholson said that the article Tolkien wrote about Beowulf is \" widely recognized as a turning point in Beowulfian criticism \" , noting that Tolkien established the primacy of the poetic nature of the work as opposed to its purely linguistic elements . At the time , the consensus of scholarship deprecated Beowulf for dealing with childish battles with monsters rather than realistic tribal warfare ; Tolkien argued that the author of Beowulf was addressing human destiny in general , not as limited by particular tribal politics , and therefore the monsters were essential to the poem . Where Beowulf does deal with specific tribal struggles , as at Finnsburg , Tolkien argued firmly against reading in fantastic elements . In the essay , Tolkien also revealed how highly he regarded Beowulf : \" Beowulf is among my most valued sources \" , and this influence may be seen throughout his Middle @-@ earth legendarium .",

  "Such large temperature variations have a destructive effect on the exposed rocky surfaces . The repeated fluctuations put a strain on exposed rock and the flanks of mountains crack and shatter . Fragmented strata slide down into the valleys where they continue to break into pieces due to the relentless sun by day and chill by night . Successive strata are exposed to further weathering . The relief of the internal pressure that has built up in rocks that have been underground for aeons can cause them to shatter . Exfoliation also occurs when the outer surfaces of rocks split off in flat flakes . This is believed to be caused by the stresses put on the rock by repeated expansions and contractions which induces fracturing parallel to the original surface . Chemical weathering processes probably play a more important role in deserts than was previously thought . The necessary moisture may be present in the form of dew or mist . Ground water may be drawn to the surface by evaporation and the formation of salt crystals may dislodge rock particles as sand or disintegrate rocks by exfoliation . Shallow caves are sometimes formed at the base of cliffs by this means .",

  "Moving to the US did not relieve Britten of the nuisance of hostile criticism : although Olin Downes , the doyen of New York music critics , and Irving Kolodin took to Britten 's music , Virgil Thomson was , as the music scholar Suzanne Robinson puts it , consistently \" severe and spiteful \" . Thomson described Les Illuminations ( 1940 ) as \" little more than a series of bromidic and facile ' effects ' ... pretentious , banal and utterly disappointing \" , and was equally unflattering about Pears 's voice . Robinson surmises that Thomson was motivated by \" a mixture of spite , national pride , and professional jealousy \" .

  "As \" the republicans themselves recognized , the party did not have size , organization and popular support enough to overthrow the monarchy . \" Republicanism \" did not manage , at any moment of its development , to spur the national soul . It never had the stature to provoke a strong enthusiasm or enlist all forces that were divorcing from the throne . \" Even with radical propaganda and little interference from the authorities , the Republican Party in existence from the beginning of the 1870s was a small one . It praised republics such as the United States , France and Argentina , while conveniently ignoring progressive monarchies such as the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries . In 1889 , its members were \" spokesmen in public squares and writers of periodicals .

  "II . Adagio in A @-@ flat major , A – B – A – B – A form . Nostalgic in its traditional classical character ( one of the few instrumental adagios Schubert wrote ) , the opening theme of this movement is an elegant , touching melody that eventually undergoes remarkable tonal and cadential treatment , undermining the peaceful setting . Charles Fisk has pointed out that the voice @-@ leading of the first phrase , 1 – 7 – 1 – 2 – 3 – 4 – 3 , is based on the initial A @-@ flat digression in the beginning of the Allegro . The unorthodox , chromatic harmonic structure of this movement is generated from a short progression that appears towards the end of the A section , leading to a plagal cadence in the subdominant key ( D @-@ flat ) , chromatically colored with its own minor subdominant chord ( G @-@ flat minor ) . The importance of this progression and of D @-@ flat in general is emphasized by its quotation in a climax of the finale 's exposition . This diversion of the main theme 's expected cadence leads to the haunted atmosphere of the B section , which is full of chromatic modulations and startling sforzandos . In the second appearance of the A and B sections , almost the entire music is shifted a semitone up , further cementing the importance of the ascending minor 2nd in the sonata as a whole . The focal plagal progression returns transformed at the end of the movement , with even subtler chromatic coloration and more distant modulations , touching on C major , before the piece finally ends in the tonic , the theme now weakened and given an illusory quality due to the evasion of cadences , free modulation , and tendency toward digression into troubled minor passages .",

  "The Tennessee Coal , Iron and Railroad Company was founded as the Sewanee Furnace Company , a small mining concern established in 1852 by Nashville entrepreneurs seeking to exploit Tennessee 's rich coal reserves and the 19th century railroad boom . After losing money , the business was sold to New York investors in 1859 and reorganized as the Tennessee Coal and Rail Company , but the outbreak of the Civil War the following year saw the fleeting company repossessed by local creditors . It became Tennessee 's leading coal extractor over the next decade , mining and transporting coal around the towns of Cowan and Tracy City in the Cumberland Mountains , and soon branched out into coke manufacture . This practice of both extracting and moving coal to market by building private rail tracks was not unusual at the time , as by owning the tracks that served their mines , businesses could undercut rivals at market by saving money on transportation .

  "Diderot 's Encyclopédie cites butterflies as a symbol for the soul . A Roman sculpture depicts a butterfly exiting the mouth of a dead man , representing the Roman belief that the soul leaves through the mouth . In line with this , the ancient Greek word for \" butterfly \" is ψυχή ( psȳchē ) , which primarily means \" soul \" or \" mind \" . According to Mircea Eliade , some of the Nagas of Manipur claim ancestry from a butterfly . In some cultures , butterflies symbolise rebirth . The butterfly is a symbol of being transgender , because of the transformation from caterpillar to winged adult . In the English county of Devon , people once hurried to kill the first butterfly of the year , to avoid a year of bad luck . In the Philippines , a lingering black butterfly or moth in the house is taken to mean a death in the family . Several American states have chosen an official state butterfly .",

  "The institution of slavery existed in all of the original thirteen British North American colonies .

The Three @-@ Fifths Clause ( in Article I , Section 2 ) allocated Congressional representation based \" on the whole Number of free Persons \" and \" three fifths of all other Persons \" . This clause was a compromise between Southerners who wished slaves to be counted as ' persons ' for congressional representation and northerners rejecting these out of concern of too much power for the South , because representation in the new Congress would be based on population in contrast to the one @-@ vote @-@ for @-@ one @-@ state principle in the earlier Continental Congress .

  "The tube @-@ like rostrum and small mouth opening restrict the tongue to protrusion @-@ retraction movements . During feeding , the tongue moves in and out around 160 times per minute ( nearly three times per second ) . According to biologist Virginia Naples , these movements are powered by the unique musculature of the giant anteater 's long , large , and flexible hyoid apparatus . Conversely , biologist Karen Reiss states that the anteater 's tongue has no attachments to the hyoid and this is what allows it to flick its tongue at such speeds . The animal relies on the orientation of its head for aim . When fully extended , the tongue can reach 45 cm ( 18 in ) , longer than the length of the skull . The buccinators allow it to slide back in without losing attached food and tighten the mouth to prevent food from escaping as it extends . When retracted , the tongue is held in the oropharynx by the secondary palate , preventing it from blocking respiration . This retraction is aided by the long sternoglossus muscle , which is formed by the fusion of the sternohyoid and the hyoglossus , and does not attach to the hyoid . Thus , the tongue is directly anchored to the sternum .",

All are placed in the tribe Oryzomyini ( \" rice rats \" ) , a diverse assemblage of over 100 species , and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae , along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents , most of which occur in South and Central America . In the United States , the marsh rice rat is the only oryzomyine rodent except for Oryzomys couesi in a small area of southern Texas ; the only other sigmodontines present are several species of cotton rats ( Sigmodon ) in the southern half of the country .",

Once it has reached the plant , the apples , carrots , and citrus fruits are separated and washed again . The fruit is pressed to get the juice , which is then flash pasteurized and bottled . A sample undergoes quality testing , and , if it passes , the batch is shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States . Odwalla juice has a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus must be refrigerated . However , after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001 , the shelf life has been considerably extended . Generally , Odwalla products are sold in special Odwalla @-@ brand displays at grocery and convenience stores , instead of being intermixed with other products .",
  "The Reverend Norcross died in 1837 . It was reported in a number of books and newspapers in the years following that Norcross had recovered his fortunes enough to leave £ 500 in his will to \" the bravest man in England \" and that , once appealed to , Wellington again turned to the events in Hougoumont , selecting Colonel Macdonnell . Macdonnell apparently split the bequest with Graham , since they had shut the gate together . There remains some doubt concerning this second bequest . Graham 's entry in the Dictionary of National Biography records only the initial annuity , and states that \" various apparently incorrect versions of the Norcross gift have been published . \" Archibald Murray ( in 1862 ) made reference to \" the alleged sum of £ 500 \" given to Colonel Macdonnell and reported investigations made by a fellow researcher who could find no proof of this bequest ; Murray concluded that the reports arose from a misrepresentation of the original annuity .

  "The term \" Paratheria \" was coined by British mammalogist Oldfield Thomas in 1887 in a review of tooth development in mammals . He found that the \" Edentata \" were especially distinctive . In this group , he included the sloths , anteaters , and armadillos , which are still placed together as Xenarthra , as well as the pangolins and the aardvark . According to Thomas , edentate teeth would be derived from the very earliest stage of mammalian dental evolution . Consequently , he suggested that they should be given a grouping separate from the other major groupings of mammals , for which terms had been introduced by Thomas Huxley : Eutheria ( placentals ) and Metatheria ( marsupials ) . For this new grouping , he suggested the name Paratheria \" to indicate their position by the side of , but separate from , the other Mammals \" ( the Greek παρά para means \" beside \" ) . Thomas had included one other mammal among the edentates , the aardvark ; however , he was unable to provide a satisfactory scenario for the origin of its wholly unique dentition , which he could only compare with that of some fish . Thomas 's arrangement was foreshadowed by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville 's 1839 classification ; he placed edentates ( except the sloth Bradypus , which he considered to be a primate ) as a major division , the Maldentés ( \" poorly toothed \" ) . This group was considered to be distinct from the other monodelphes ( placentals ) , the Bien dentés ( \" well @-@ toothed \" ) . Similarly , Paul Gervais proposed in 1855 that edentates should be placed in a separate subclass of mammals .",

The poem 's ending lines , which justify the landscape in theological terms , are also a theological statement of the body 's sacred significance . The poem is thus an argument against Platonic and idealistic theologies in which the body is inherently fallen and inferior to the spirit . This interpretation is consistent with Auden 's many prose statements about the theological importance of the body .",

  "Mega Man 3 brought new characters and gameplay mechanics to the franchise . Though Inafune considers the gameplay to have lost some of its simplicity , he felt Mega Man 's slide ability was successfully implemented to enhance the player 's control while battling enemies . Mega Man 's sidekick dog Rush was designed by combining the functionality of three support tools from Mega Man 2 , which would ease the player 's navigation of stages . In addition to the Marine and Coil modes , Rush was originally intended to have a \" drill \" mode that would allow Mega Man to tunnel underground . Another new character , Proto Man , was introduced in a way that the player would be unable to tell if he was an ally or an enemy to Mega Man . His design was influenced by anime , and he was given both a scarf and shield to make him appear \" tougher \" than Mega Man . The design team wanted Proto Man to sport uncovered hair , but they instead opted for an open @-@ faced helmet illustration for both the television commercials and instruction manual . Proto Man 's original Japanese name , Blues , was changed by Capcom 's North American division despite Inafune 's protests . Capcom did this not only to be consistent with Rockman 's English name , but because they thought that the name Blues made no sense . Inafune attempted to defend it due to the name 's musical connotation to character names in the series .

Even before the outbreak of World War II and the Greek @-@ Italian War , Mussolini had expressed his wish to annex the Ionian Islands as part of his wider plans for an Italian Empire centered around the Mediterranean Sea . On 15 October , in a meeting in the Palazzo Venezia , he made the final decision to invade Greece . His initial goal was the occupation of Corfu , Zante and Cephalonia . After the fall of Greece , in early April 1941 , the invaders divided its lands into three occupation zones ; the Italians occupied much of the country , including the Ionians . Mussolini informed General Carlo Geloso that the Ionian Islands would form a separate Italian province through a de facto annexation , but the Germans would not approve it . The Italian authorities nevertheless continued to prepare the ground for the annexation . Finally , on 22 April 1941 , after discussions between the German and Italian rulers , German führer Adolf Hitler agreed that Italy could proceed with a de facto annexation of the islands . From then on , until the end of the war , the islands passed through a phase of Italianization in all areas , from their administration to their economy .",

  "Throughout his life , Wrigley was an \" inveterate note @-@ taker \" who compiled extensive documentation concerning the theory and practice of air power , on which he lectured among colleagues in the RAAF during the 1920s . The concepts that he propagated included air superiority , the need for an air force to be separate from the other branches of the armed services , control of the air as a means of carrying out offensive strikes , and the substitution of aerial forces for ground troops . While arguing for the independence of the air arm , Wrigley was quick to dispel any notion that it would simply \" arrive from God knows where , drop [ its ] bombs God knows where , and go off again God knows where \" ; rather it should act in concert with the army and navy in furtherance of government policy . He is thus credited with laying the foundations for the RAAF 's modern air power doctrine , which would eventually be codified as the Air Power Manual in 1990 . Wrigley 's widow bequeathed twenty volumes of his writings , maps and photographs to the RAAF Museum at Point Cook after his death ; they were edited and published by Air Commodore Brendan O 'Loghlin and Wing Commander Alan Stephens in 1990 as The Decisive Factor : Air Power Doctrine by Air Vice @-@ Marshal H.N. Wrigley . In 1996 , Wrigley 's former residence as commanding officer of RAAF Station Laverton prior to World War II was christened Wrigley House in his honour .

After the fall of the Khmer Empire in the early 15th century , the Dongrek Mountains served as a natural border leaving the Khmer north of the mountains under the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of Lan Xang . The conquests of Cambodia by Naresuan the Great for Ayutthaya furthered their political and economic isolation from Cambodia proper , leading to a dialect that developed relatively independently from the midpoint of the Middle Khmer period . This has resulted in a distinct accent influenced by the surrounding tonal languages Lao and Thai , lexical differences , and phonemic differences in both vowels and distribution of consonants . Syllable @-@ final / r / , which has become silent in other dialects of Khmer , is still pronounced in Northern Khmer .

Fruit bodies have conical to bell @-@ shaped purple caps up to 2 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 in ) set atop slender stipes up to 10 cm ( 4 in ) long . The mushroom is named for the characteristic dark greyish @-@ purple color of its gill edges . In the field , M. purpureofusca mushrooms can usually be distinguished from similar species by characteristics such as the dark purple gill edges , the deep purple cap center , and its cartilagineous consistency . The fungus contains a laccase enzyme that has been investigated scientifically for its potential to detoxify recalcitrant industrial dyes used in textile dyeing and printing processes .",

  "At the time of its collection , the herpetologists who later described Ecnomiohyla rabborum were already aware of the encroaching threat of the chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis ( colloquially referred to by biologists as \" Bd \" ) in Panama . The fungus causes an infectious amphibian disease called chytridiomycosis , which has been linked to the massive decline and extinction of amphibian species in certain parts of the world ; including the Americas , Australia , and New Zealand . Infected amphibians can display a wide variety of symptoms , usually including lethargic and abnormal behavior , convulsions , peeling skin , ulcers , and hemorrhaging ; eventually resulting in death . The origin of the disease is unknown , but there is speculation that it may have been introduced throughout the world via importation of the African clawed frog ( Xenopus laevis ) .",

  "Pemberton and Shearsmith are fans of classic horror films , and the episode displays inspiration from the likes of Alfred Hitchcock 's filmography and the Hammer Horror films . Pemberton called the episode the \" most genre \" of the series , while Shearsmith described it as their attempt to produce a \" full on ... gothic horror @-@ esque \" episode . The writers utilised the horror norm of a gothic mansion rather than bringing horror into a normal home . This route , Shearsmith suggested , has now become atypical . The setting allowed the writers to mix modern elements with traditional gothic horror , sometimes for comedic effect ( a reference to \" something called broadbands \" ) , and sometimes to add to the horror ( mobile phones cannot be used , as the characters are in a \" dead zone \" ) . While the writers did want the episode grounded in reality , they also wanted to make more use of gothic horror tropes than they had in other episodes of Inside No. 9 . \" The Harrowing \" was advertised with a poster homage to classic horror films . The poster was designed by Graham Humphreys , a graphic designer known for his work on horror film posters .

  "According to the nebular hypothesis , stars form in massive and dense clouds of molecular hydrogen — giant molecular clouds ( GMC ) . These clouds are gravitationally unstable , and matter coalesces within them to smaller denser clumps , which then rotate , collapse , and form stars .

Dickinson took up the opportunity and called an old friend of his , former Gillan guitarist , Janick Gers , and , shortly after meeting up , they had \" Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter \" ready for the studio , then recorded with the assistance of bassist Andy Carr , and drummer Fabio del Rio . \" I wrote it in about three minutes \" , states Dickinson , \" I don 't know where the title ' Bring Your Daughter to the Slaughter ' came from , but it just popped into my head .

  "There had been calls for reform long before 1832 , but without success . The Act that finally succeeded was proposed by the Whigs , led by Prime Minister Charles Grey , 2nd Earl Grey . It met with significant opposition from the Pittite factions in Parliament , who had long governed the country ; opposition was especially pronounced in the House of Lords . Nevertheless , the bill was eventually passed , mainly as a result of public pressure . The Act granted seats in the House of Commons to large cities that had sprung up during the Industrial Revolution , and removed seats from the \" rotten boroughs \" : those with very small electorates and usually dominated by a wealthy patron . The Act also increased the electorate from about 500 @,@ 000 to 813 @,@ 000 , with about one in five adult males allowed to vote , from a total population ( including women and children ) of some 14 million ( about 5 @.@ 8 % of the total population - in comparison : in Baden , Germany , it was 17 % at that time , in France 5 % ) .",
  "On 9 December 1909 , a cable was sent by Governor @-@ General Lord Dudley to the Secretary of State for the Colonies , The Earl of Crewe , requesting that construction of three Town class cruisers and an Indefatigable @-@ class battlecruiser start at earliest opportunity . It is unclear why this design was selected , given that it was known to be inferior to the battlecruisers entering service with the German Imperial Navy ( Kaiserliche Marine ) . Historian John Roberts has suggested that the request may have been attributable to the Royal Navy 's practice of using small battleships and large cruisers as flagships of stations far from Britain , or it might have reflected the preferences of the First Sea Lord and Admiral of the Fleet John Fisher , preferences not widely shared .",
  "Iguanodon was recorded from Africa based on teeth from Tunisia and elsewhere in the Sahara , but the description of Lurdusaurus and Ouranosaurus cast doubt on African records of Iguanodon .

  "In 1930 – 31 , aged 22 , Fingleton regained his position at the start of the Sheffield Shield season for New South Wales , and first came to prominence when he withstood a ferocious opening spell against the express pace of Eddie Gilbert in Brisbane against Queensland .

  "Zur 's maneuver sent Israel 's forces into unknown territory , and they encountered an Egyptian entrenchment that caught them unawares . His original plan was to send Yosef Harpaz and the 3rd Company and then Dromi 's company , but when fire was opened on Harpaz 's men ( at approximately 04 : 00 ) , Zur ordered him to execute a frontal assault . Harpaz decided to do this in three single @-@ platoon waves : the first two would attack the Egyptians , while the third would provide cover for the forces . The first platoon was inexperienced and had never fought against Egypt 's army . After advancing , they encountered what were probably Bren carriers , which their commander reported were tanks . Harpaz then sent the second , more experienced , platoon of 15 men , who were also able to better utilize the cover fire . Eventually , the first platoon fled from the battlefield without being ordered to do so and the attack was only two platoons strong . However , this still assisted Aryeh Kotzer on the other side of the Egyptian positions to evacuate his injured troops .",
  "Frost felt the excellent performance of his new engine would be a natural fit for a VTOL aircraft due to its high expected power @-@ to @-@ weight ratio . The problem was how to use the annular thrust to drive the aircraft forward , as well as the problem of fitting the very large engine into a suitable airframe . Frost suggested using a series of ducts and vents to redirect the thrust flowing out of the front of the engine towards the rear . In order to keep the pipes as short as possible , the design ported the thrust out along the leading edge of what was essentially a thick delta wing . As the engine was disk @-@ shaped , the triangular delta shape was pushed out near the front where it met the engine disk , producing a shape roughly like a spade on a playing card . For this reason the design was also referred to as the \" Avro Ace , \" a likely reference to the Ace of Spades .",
