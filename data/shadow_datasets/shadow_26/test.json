  "New York Dolls nonetheless received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics . In a rave review for NME , Nick Kent said the band 's raunchy style of rock and roll was vividly recorded by Rundgren on an album that , besides Iggy and the Stooges ' Raw Power ( 1973 ) , served as the only one \" so far to fully define just exactly where 1970s rock should be coming from \" . Trouser Press founder and editor Ira Robbins viewed New York Dolls as an innovative record and found the band 's music brilliantly chaotic and well produced by Rundgren . Ellen Willis , writing for The New Yorker , said it was by far the year 's most compelling hard rock album and that at least half of its songs were immediate classics , particularly \" Personality Crisis \" and \" Trash \" , which she called \" transcendent \" . In Newsday , Christgau hailed the New York Dolls as \" the best hard rock band in the country and maybe the world right now \" , writing that their \" special genius \" was combining the shrewd songwriting savvy of early @-@ 1960s popular music with the anarchic sound of late @-@ 1960s heavy metal . He believed the record 's frenzied approach , various emotions , and wild noise conveyed Manhattan 's harsh , deviant thrill better than the Velvet Underground . In a less enthusiastic review , Rolling Stone critic Tony Glover believed the band 's impressive live sound was mostly preserved on the album , but he was slightly critical of production flourishes and overdubs , feeling they made some lyrics incomprehensible and some choruses too sonorous . Although he was surprised Rundgren 's production worked well with the group 's raunchy sound on most of the songs , Glover ultimately asked whether or not \" the record alone will impress as much as seeing them live ( they 're a highly watchable group ) . \"",
  "Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different ( but overlapping ) movements , all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focussed on ideology 's relationship to women . Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women 's oppression , and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies . Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women 's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women 's oppression . Anarcha @-@ feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy , which comes from involuntary hierarchy .",

  "History is often analyzed with contemporary ideologies ; Ancient Greece as a subject enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century . Based on their social priorities , British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized , white , and masculine society , and essentially removed women from historical importance . Women in Greece were sequestered with each other , and men with men . In this homosocial environment , erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature , art , and philosophy . Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women . There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls . The poet Alcman used the term aitis , as the feminine form of aites — which was the official term for the younger participant in a pederastic relationship . Aristophanes , in Plato 's Symposium , mentions women who love women , but uses the term trepesthai ( to be focused on ) instead of eros , which was applied to other erotic relationships between men , and between men and women .",

  "In December 1944 , Hitler launched the Ardennes Offensive , also known as the Battle of the Bulge , a significant counterattack against the western Allies through the Ardennes with the aim of reaching Antwerp while encircling the Allied armies in the area . The offensive began with an artillery barrage shortly before dawn on 16 December . Spearheading the attack were two panzer armies composed largely of Waffen @-@ SS divisions . The battle groups found advancing through the forests and wooded hills of the Ardennes difficult in the winter weather , but they initially made good progress in the northern sector . They soon encountered strong resistance from the US 2nd and 99th Infantry Divisions .

In increasingly difficult conditions , the German advance slowed and was stopped . Hitler 's failed offensive cost 700 tanks and most of their remaining mobile forces in the west , as well as most of their irreplaceable reserves of manpower and materiel .",

  "While the concept of ships protected by armor existed before the advent of the ironclad Monitor , the need for iron plating on ships only arose after the shell @-@ firing cannon was introduced to naval warfare in the 1820s . The use of heavy iron plating on the sides of warships was not practical until steam propulsion matured enough to carry its great weight . Developments in gun technology had progressed by the 1840s so that no practical thickness of wood could withstand the power of a shell . In response , the United States began construction in 1854 of a steam @-@ powered ironclad warship , the Stevens Battery , but work was delayed and the designer , Robert Stevens , died in 1856 , stalling further work . Since there was no pressing need for such a ship at the time , there was little demand to continue work on the unfinished vessel . It was France that introduced the first operational armored ships as well as the first shell guns and rifled cannons . Experience during the Crimean War of 1854 – 55 showed that armored ships could withstand repeated hits without significant damage when French ironclad floating batteries defeated Russian coastal fortifications during the Battle of Kinburn . Ericsson claimed to have sent the French Emperor Napoléon III a proposal for a monitor @-@ type design , with a gun turret , in September 1854 , but no record of any such submission could be found in the archives of the French Ministry of the Navy ( Ministre de la Marine ) when they were searched by naval historian James Phinney Baxter III .

  "Pilot whales generally take several breaths before diving for a few minutes . Feeding dives may last over ten minutes . They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters , but most dives are to a depth of 30 – 60 m . Shallow dives tend to take place during the day , while deeper ones take place at night . When making deep dives , pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast @-@ moving prey such as squid . Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales , foraging short @-@ finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth . When they reach the end of their dives , pilot whales will sprint , possibly to catch prey , and then make a few buzzes . This is unusual considering deep @-@ diving , breath @-@ holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen . The animal 's high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths , which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals .

  "Near the town of Sharpsburg , Lee deployed his available forces behind Antietam Creek along a low ridge , starting on September 15 . While it was an effective defensive position , it was not an impregnable one . The terrain provided excellent cover for infantrymen , with rail and stone fences , outcroppings of limestone , and little hollows and swales . The creek to their front was only a minor barrier , ranging from 60 to 100 feet ( 18 – 30 m ) in width , and was fordable in places and crossed by three stone bridges each a mile ( 1 @.@ 5 km ) apart . It was also a precarious position because the Confederate rear was blocked by the Potomac River and only a single crossing point , Boteler 's Ford at Shepherdstown , was nearby should retreat be necessary . ( The ford at Williamsport , Maryland , was 10 miles ( 16 km ) northwest from Sharpsburg and had been used by Jackson in his march to Harpers Ferry .

Joan Roughgarden , an ecologist and evolutionary biologist , said that because the hyena 's clitoris is higher on the belly than the vagina in most mammals , the male hyena \" must slide his rear under the female when mating so that his penis lines up with [ her clitoris ] \" .

  "Hepatitis B virus DNA persists in the body after infection , and in some people the disease recurs . Although rare , reactivation is seen most often following alcohol or drug use , or in people with impaired immunity . HBV goes through cycles of replication and non @-@ replication . Approximately 50 % of overt carriers experience acute reactivation . Males with baseline ALT of 200 UL / L are three times more likely to develop a reactivation than people with lower levels . Although reactivation can occur spontaneously , people who undergo chemotherapy have a higher risk . Immunosuppressive drugs favor increased HBV replication while inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function in the liver . The risk of reactivation varies depending on the serological profile ; those with detectable HBsAg in their blood are at the greatest risk , but those with only antibodies to the core antigen are also at risk . The presence of antibodies to the surface antigen , which are considered to be a marker of immunity , does not preclude reactivation . Treatment with prophylactic antiviral drugs can prevent the serious morbidity associated with HBV disease reactivation .",

  "Constant pressure charts normally contain plotted values of temperature , humidity , wind , and the vertical height above sea level of the pressure surface . They have a variety of uses . In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau , the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis . Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces , one can determine when and where warm advection ( coincident with upward vertical motion ) and cold advection ( coincident with downward vertical motion ) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere . Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft . The 500 hPa pressure surface can be used as a rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones . Shallower tropical cyclones , which have experienced vertical wind shear , tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level .",

  "In November 1919 , the CLR published a new bill to revive the Richmond extension , but using a different route that required only a short section of new tunnel construction . The new proposal was to construct tunnels southwards from Shepherd 's Bush station , which would come to the surface to connect to disused L & SWR tracks north of Hammersmith Grove Road station that had closed in 1916 . From Hammersmith , the disused LS & WR tracks continued westwards , on the same viaduct as the DR 's tracks through Turnham Green to Gunnersbury and Richmond . The plan required electrification of the disused tracks , but avoided the need for costly tunnelling and would have shared the existing stations on the route with the DR. The plan received assent on 4 August 1920 as part of the Central London and Metropolitan District Railway Companies ( Works ) Act , 1920 , although the CLR made no attempt to carry out any of the work .

  "The first obviously gay character was Extraño , an effeminate Peruvian man whose name means \" Strange \" in Spanish , who was created by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton and appeared in Millennium and New Guardians in 1987 . New Guardians was not successful , but during its short run it also featured one team member , Jet , contracting AIDS . The series was controversial , as several characters on the team were infected with HIV through the scratch of a character called the Hemo @-@ Goblin . Many angry letters were printed in response to this misinformation about HIV transmission , along with some gay readers complaing that Extraño was too stereotypical . An official aftermath to Millennium , The Spectre ( vol . 2 ) # 11 , depicted a \" mostly male and mostly gay \" AIDS rally . Several characters , including the Enchantress ( describing them as \" filthy disgusting men \" ) and a police helicopter pilot named Ed ( screaming about \" fags \" ) are influenced into attempting to crush the rally by a seven @-@ headed spirit .

Tillery writes : \" Where does he find himself ?

  "At the time , Tampa was rated the worst U.S. city for syphilis infections among USAAF personnel , and the city with the most rampant prostitution . USAAF Captain Robert Dyer , charged with protecting the country 's airmen from venereal disease ( VD ) , had no success getting Tampa authorities to address the problem . When Streett arrived at his command and saw the extent of the VD crisis at MacDill Field , he threatened to close certain areas of Tampa to all military personnel if the city 's police were unable to curb prostitution . This action would have ruined a number of legitimate local businesses , and a campaign was initiated to arrest prostitutes and to bar unmarried couples from renting a room together . Police arrests , however , were limited to misdemeanor charges of vagrancy or loitering — there were no state or local laws specific to prostitution . In response to complaints from Streett and other military leaders , in January 1943 Florida 's Department of Health mounted a statewide media blitz encouraging testing and treatment for VD . Later that year , the state passed a law giving police wide latitude to arrest prostitutes for hire and also unmarried persons participating in \" licentious sexual intercourse without hire . \"",

  "Ostfriesland was present during the first sortie by the German fleet into the North Sea , which took place on 2 – 3 November 1914 . No British forces were encountered during the operation . A second operation followed on 15 – 16 December . This sortie was the initiation of a strategy adopted by Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl , the commander of the High Seas Fleet . Admiral von Ingenohl intended to use the battlecruisers of Konteradmiral ( Rear Admiral ) Franz von Hipper 's I Scouting Group to raid British coastal towns to lure out portions of the Grand Fleet where they could be destroyed by the High Seas Fleet . Early on 15 December the fleet left port to raid the towns of Scarborough , Hartlepool , and Whitby .

  "Scholars believe psoriasis to have been included among the various skin conditions called tzaraath ( translated as leprosy ) in the Hebrew Bible , a condition imposed as a punishment for slander .

However , it is more likely that this confusion arose from the use of the same Greek term for both conditions . The Greeks used the term lepra ( λεπρα ) for scaly skin conditions .

  "Like all other lemurs , the silky sifaka is a seasonal breeder , and it is thought that it mates only one day a year during the start of the rainy season sometime in December or January . Infants are born six months later in June or July . Females typically give birth to a single infant once every two years , although births in consecutive years have been observed . Infants initially cling to the fur of their mother 's chest for nearly four weeks and then switch to riding on her back . As with other eastern rainforest sifakas , the infants of this species develop rapidly . This may be due to assistance in the care of infants by all group members ( known as alloparental care ) — a trait typical among all sifakas . Non @-@ maternal care usually takes the form of allogrooming , but also playing , occasional carrying , and in rare cases , nursing . The dispersal of offspring is thought to be similar to that of other eastern rainforest sifakas , with both males and females transferring out of the group at sexual maturity . However , dispersal has only been observed once with a young adult male , who left its natal group and proceeded to oust an older male from a group in which he had been a member for seven years . Female dispersal and group transfer has not yet been observed .",

Females can give birth to litters of one to five kittens ; typically two to three kittens are born . Females may raise two litters in a year . Kittens weigh between 43 and 55 grams ( 1 @.@ 5 and 1 @.@ 9 oz ) at birth , tending to be much smaller in the wild than in captivity . Initially blind and helpless , they open their eyes at ten to thirteen days of age and are fully weaned by around three months . Males usually do not participate in the raising of kittens ; however , in captivity , males appear to be very protective of their offspring . Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months . The lifespan of the jungle cat under captivity is 15 to 20 years ; this is possibly higher than that in the wild .",

  "Before Cyrus and his army crossed the Aras River to battle with the Armenians , he installed his son Cambyses II as king in case he should not return from battle . However , once Cyrus had crossed the Aras River , he had a vision in which Darius had wings atop his shoulders and stood upon the confines of Europe and Asia ( the known world ) . When Cyrus awoke from the dream , he inferred it as a great danger to the future security of the empire , as it meant that Darius would one day rule the whole world . However , his son Cambyses was the heir to the throne , not Darius , causing Cyrus to wonder if Darius was forming treasonable and ambitious designs . This led Cyrus to order Hystaspes to go back to Persis and watch over his son strictly , until Cyrus himself returned . Darius did not seem to have any treasonous thoughts as Cambyses II ascended the throne peacefully ; and , through promotion , Darius was eventually elevated to be Cambyses 's personal lancer .",

  "Physically , carbon – oxygen white dwarfs with a low rate of rotation are limited to below 1 @.@ 38 solar masses ( M ☉ ) . Beyond this , they re @-@ ignite and in some cases trigger a supernova explosion . Somewhat confusingly , this limit is often referred to as the Chandrasekhar mass , despite being marginally different from the absolute Chandrasekhar limit where electron degeneracy pressure is unable to prevent catastrophic collapse . If a white dwarf gradually accretes mass from a binary companion , the general hypothesis is that its core will reach the ignition temperature for carbon fusion as it approaches the limit . If the white dwarf merges with another white dwarf ( a very rare event ) , it will momentarily exceed the limit and begin to collapse , again raising its temperature past the nuclear fusion ignition point . Within a few seconds of initiation of nuclear fusion , a substantial fraction of the matter in the white dwarf undergoes a runaway reaction , releasing enough energy ( 1 – 2 × 1044 J ) to unbind the star in a supernova explosion .",

  "As originally enacted , the Horse Protection Act was to be enforced by Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service ( APHIS ) , a branch of the USDA . However , a lack of staff and funding meant little success , leading to the 1976 amendment to the act . With this amendment , Congress created a Designated Qualified Person ( DQP ) program . This program allows non @-@ USDA employees from within the equine community to take training and certification programs run by Horse Industry Organizations ( HIOs ) and supervised by the USDA ; after completing the training , they may complete inspections for violations of the HPA at public events . The USDA is then able to double check the work of DQP participants by making random inspections at a small number of shows . One member of the Tennessee Walking Horse world states that this creates \" the potential for a \" fox guarding the chicken coop \" situation \" , as if the HIO is not fully interested in preventing or detecting the practice of soring , the DQPs may not be fully trained or may deliberately overlook instances of soring . When APHIS inspectors are present at horse shows , the number of citations for violations increases significantly . Competitors and trainers at shows , viewing themselves as unjustly persecuted , have been known to leave when they find APHIS inspectors present , rather than allowing the inspectors to see their horses . In June 2012 , the USDA published a new rule requiring violations found by HIOs to have penalties assessed at a rate equal to or exceeding those given by APHIS inspectors . Previously , HIOs were allowed to set their own penalty rates , resulting in some organizations acting leniently towards violators of the HPA .",

The speech was a factor in unrest in Poland and revolution in Hungary later in 1956 , and Stalin defenders led four days of rioting in his native Georgia in June , calling for Khrushchev to resign and Molotov to take over . In meetings where the Secret Speech was read , communists would make even more severe condemnations of Stalin ( and of Khrushchev ) , and even call for multi @-@ party elections . However , Stalin was not publicly denounced , and his portrait remained widespread through the USSR , from airports to Khrushchev 's Kremlin office .

  "One mystery of the asteroid belt is the relative rarity of V @-@ type , or basaltic asteroids . Theories of asteroid formation predict that objects the size of Vesta or larger should form crusts and mantles , which would be composed mainly of basaltic rock , resulting in more than half of all asteroids being composed either of basalt or olivine . Observations , however , suggest that 99 percent of the predicted basaltic material is missing . Until 2001 , most basaltic bodies discovered in the asteroid belt were believed to originate from the asteroid Vesta ( hence their name V @-@ type ) . However , the discovery of the asteroid 1459 Magnya revealed a slightly different chemical composition from the other basaltic asteroids discovered until then , suggesting a different origin . This hypothesis was reinforced by the further discovery in 2007 of two asteroids in the outer belt , 7472 Kumakiri and ( 10537 ) 1991 RY16 , with differing basaltic composition that could not have originated from Vesta . These latter two are the only V @-@ type asteroids discovered in the outer belt to date .",

  "This already applied at the top : the constitution contained an age @-@ requirement for the members of the Uitvoerend Bewind , which favored the election of staid Patriot regents , and discriminated against the more talented \" young Turks \" that were appointed Agents , like Jacobus Spoors , Gerrit Jan Pijman and Isaac Jan Alexander Gogel . The tenor of the Bewind became more conservative in the ensuing years . The agents went to work energetically , however , and started with an onslaught on the old administrative organization of the country , in a deliberate attempt to liquidate the very identity of the old federal structure . The once mighty province of Holland was carved into three pieces : Amstel ( Amsterdam and immediate vicinity ) , Texel ( the northern peninsula ) and Delf ( the southern part ) ; and the other provinces were often merged in larger entities , like Overijssel and Drente into Ouden Yssel , and Frisia and Groningen into the Eems department . The aim was to organize the country into units with equal numbers of primary assemblies ( hence the small Amstel department with its large population ) . The first elections for the administrative organs of these new entities were held in March 1799 . But , of course , such a reorganization did not suddenly change the old allegiances of the people living in these areas . In any case , the new local and departmental administrations , though elected , were supposed to execute the policies as centrally laid down by the national government . As the elections often put people in power who represented the old order ( like Joan Arend de Vos van Steenwijk in Ouden Yssel ) this was exceedingly unlikely . To put it differently , the political effort to attain \" national unity \" through reconciliation of the diverse Patriot factions of all stripes , got in the way of the effort to create an efficient national unitary state , as envisioned by Gogel .",

  "The Mendelian and biometrician models were eventually reconciled with the development of population genetics . A key step was the work of the British biologist and statistician Ronald Fisher . In a series of papers starting in 1918 and culminating in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection , Fisher showed that the continuous variation measured by the biometricians could be produced by the combined action of many discrete genes , and that natural selection could change gene frequencies in a population , resulting in evolution . In a series of papers beginning in 1924 , another British geneticist , J. B. S.

When the first Quakers arrived in Boston in 1656 there were no laws yet enacted against them , but this quickly changed , and punishments were meted out with or without the law . It was primarily the ministers and the magistrates who opposed the Quakers and their evangelistic efforts .

With streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers , whales can travel at up to 20 knots , though they are not as flexible or agile as seals . Whales produce a great variety of vocalizations , notably the extended songs of the humpback whale . Although whales are widespread , most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres , and migrate to the equator to give birth . Species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding . Males typically mate with multiple females every year , but females only mate every two to three years . Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them . Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time .",

Its main vocalisations are soft chirping calls that are extended into longer songs with other sounds interspersed by breeding males . Historically , this species was thought to be very closely related to the house sparrow , but its closest evolutionary affinities may lie elsewhere . Discovered around 1840 , this species went undetected for several decades after its discovery .",
  "A measure of William 's success in taking control is that , from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204 , William and his successors were largely absentee rulers . For example , after 1072 , William spent more than 75 per cent of his time in France rather than England .

The geographical regions generally do not conform to county boundaries or other administrative divisions , and all of them encompass further , more specific , geographic regions .",

  "Like the video , Campbell noted the song for merging disparate and contradictory musical features in it . He found that the simple melody of \" Like a Prayer \" offered an easy listen , as the contrasts in sound , rhythm and texture appealed to different target audiences . He also believed that the usage of choir and organ paved the way for gospel music to be more mainstream than before . In 1999 , the University of Michigan School of Music , Theatre & Dance held a seminar on the different implications and metaphors present in the song ; it was headed by professors Martin Katz , George Shirley and Michael Daugherty . The main topic discussed was the fact that there can be different metaphorical meanings of the song , as the word \" like \" can be taken in separate contexts . Shirley explained that although when one thinks of \" Like a Prayer \" , they would first think of its visual aspects , but for him the lyrics are far more important as they reinforce the postmodern nature of the video . The ambiguity of the word \" like \" blurs distinctions between a human lover and God , evident strongly in the line \" Like a child , you whisper softly to me \" . This was further explained by Katz , who added : \" The music of ' Like a Prayer ' is probably a mitigating one , blunting and softening the harder edges , the more challenging content of the lyrics and the video . \"",
  "The Hebrew Bible , a religious interpretation of the traditions and early national history of the Jews , established the first of the Abrahamic religions , which are now practiced by 54 % of the world . Judaism guides its adherents in both practice and belief , and has been called not only a religion , but also a \" way of life , \" which has made drawing a clear distinction between Judaism , Jewish culture , and Jewish identity rather difficult . Throughout history , in eras and places as diverse as the ancient Hellenic world , in Europe before and after The Age of Enlightenment ( see Haskalah ) , in Islamic Spain and Portugal , in North Africa and the Middle East , India , China , or the contemporary United States and Israel , cultural phenomena have developed that are in some sense characteristically Jewish without being at all specifically religious . Some factors in this come from within Judaism , others from the interaction of Jews or specific communities of Jews with their surroundings , others from the inner social and cultural dynamics of the community , as opposed to from the religion itself . This phenomenon has led to considerably different Jewish cultures unique to their own communities .",

  "A second Jin campaign in late 1217 did marginally better than the first . In the east , the Jin made little headway in the Huai River valley , but in the west they captured Xihezhou and Dasan Pass ( 大散關 ; modern Shaanxi ) in late 1217 . The Jin tried to captured Suizhou in Jingxi South circuit again in 1218 and 1219 , but failed .

Unwanted particles may be flicked away by tentacles or shut out by closing the mouth . A study in 2008 showed that both encrusting and erect colonies fed more quickly and grew faster in gentle than in strong currents .",

  "Spain forbade its American colonies to trade with other nations or foreign colonies , and imposed itself as the only buyer and vendor for their international trade . This situation damaged the viceroyalty , as Spain 's economy was not powerful enough to produce the huge supply of goods that the numerous colonies would need . This caused economic shortages and recession . The Spanish trade routes favored the ports of Mexico and Lima , to the detriment of Buenos Aires . As a result , Buenos Aires smuggled those products that could not be obtained legitimately . Most local authorities allowed this smuggling as a lesser evil , even though it was illegal , and it occasionally equalled in volume the legal commerce with Spain . Two antagonistic factions emerged : the landowners wanted free trade so they could sell their products abroad , while the merchants , who benefited from the high prices of smuggled imports , opposed free trade because prices would come down .",

  "The architectural writer Geoffrey Tyack has written that Nuffield College was Oxford 's \" most important architectural project of the immediate post @-@ war years \" . Opinions about the architecture merits of the college have varied , although most have been unfavourable . The authors of a 1961 booklet on the architecture of modern Oxford said that it was \" Oxford 's biggest monument to barren reaction \" . The Cotswold style was \" taken absurdly out of context and mercilessly stretched \" , and did not \" harmonise with the clumsy tower \" , whilst the spire \" [ perched ] uneasily ... despite its elaborate base \" . An unnamed journalist wrote in The Times in 1959 that the main buildings of the quadrangles were \" somewhat oddly wedded to small basins which irresistibly suggest a Lilliputian Versailles \" . The same writer said that the tower rose \" Manhattan @-@ wise for 10 storeys through the twentieth century , only to have a diminutive spire , escaped from the fifteenth , push through its top to steal the last laugh \" .

  "The port city of Memel ( now Klaipėda ) and the surrounding area , with a predominantly German population , was under provisional Allied control according to Article 99 of the Treaty of Versailles . The French and Polish governments favoured turning Memel into an international city , while Lithuania wanted to annex the area . By 1923 , the fate of the area had still not been decided , prompting Lithuanian forces to invade in January 1923 and seize the port . After the Allies failed to reach an agreement with Lithuania , they referred the matter to the League of Nations . In December 1923 , the League Council appointed a Commission of Inquiry . The commission chose to cede Memel to Lithuania and give the area autonomous rights . The Klaipėda Convention was approved by the League Council on 14 March 1924 , and then by the Allied powers and Lithuania . In 1939 Germany retook the region following the rise of the Nazis and an ultimatum to Lithuania , demanding the return of the region under threat of war .

  "During cooperative play as a band , all players earn points towards a common score , though score multipliers and \" Overdrive \" are tracked separately for each player . Overdrive is collected during select portions of a song by successfully playing all white notes within that section ( or by using the guitar controller 's whammy bar during white sustained notes ) . Once the Energy Meter is filled halfway , players can deploy their Overdrive , resulting in the \" Band Meter \" ( which tracks how well each player is doing ) changing more dramatically . This allows players to strategically use Overdrive to raise the Band Meter and pass portions of a song they otherwise might have failed .

  "The immediate post @-@ World War II era was a difficult time for kabuki . Besides the devastation caused to major Japanese cities as a result of the war , the popular trend was to reject the styles and thoughts of the past , kabuki among them . Also , during the early years of the Allied Occupation of Japan , the occupying authorities banned kabuki as feudalistic and detrimental to the public morals , though by 1947 this ban was lifted . Other traditional forms of theater , such as noh and bunraku , seen as less flamboyant and violent than kabuki , received less attention from Occupation censors . Kabuki scholars credit Takechi 's innovative productions of the kabuki classics with bringing about a rebirth of interest in the kabuki in the Kansai region after this low point in kabuki history . Takechi revitalized kabuki by reaching out to the other theatrical forms — noh , kyōgen , and the modern theater and dance — for new ideas and collaboration . He broke through long @-@ established barriers which existed between these theatrical forms , and even between kabuki schools , to create an energetic new form of kabuki . Despite his maverick nature , Takechi gave great attention to the classic kabuki texts , and emphasized to his actors the need to inhabit the roles they played . His approach to a new interpretation of the old texts was to \" psychologize \" them . By bringing out the psychology already present in the classic texts , Takechi felt that actors could interpret their roles with vitality and energy which he felt was lacking in contemporary performances . Of the many popular young stars of the kabuki who performed under Takechi , Nakamura Ganjiro III ( born 1931 ) was the leading figure . At first known as Nakamura Senjaku , this period in Osaka kabuki became known as the \" Age of Senjaku \" in his honor .",

  "Another view is that Section 3 provides a much strengthened basis for the sort of \" weak review \" – the scope of which carefully determined between courts on one hand and parliament on the other – in a statutory form . There have been at least three criticisms put forward : firstly that the impossibility of implied repeal goes against some formulations of parliamentary sovereignty that require that no parliament can bind a future parliament . Secondly , whether section 3 interpretations follow parliamentary intent is questionable ; thirdly , if it does allow interpretations contrary to intent , section 3 may render section 4 necessary . However , judicial powers are probably not unconstrained . The analysis of what the courts can and cannot do would also provide the answer the third criticism , depending on the viewpoint . Whilst the scope of section 3 has been criticised for being vague , and leading therefore more easily to the imposition of the judiciary on the legal domain of parliament , this viewpoint is controversial : they do not seem to have yet so encroached and there are rules emerging about the application of section 3 .",

  "Esbjerg 's oldest existing house , on the corner of Kongensgade , was built around 1660 . The town itself was not established until 1868 when it was built as a replacement for the harbour in Altona , which had previously been Denmark 's most important North Sea port but came under German control after the Second Schleswig War in 1864 . At the time , Esbjerg consisted of only a few farms . Developed under royal decree from 1868 until 1874 , the harbour was officially opened in 1874 , with rail connections to Varde and to Fredericia , an important hub on the east coast of Jutland . Initial planning of the town was conducted by chartered surveyor H. Wilkens in 1870 with streets laid out in the form of a rectangular grid . The market square ( Torvet ) was positioned at the centre , midway between the harbour and the railway station .

  "The 8th Division was sent to France in November 1914 ; immediately after arrival , two battalions were deployed to hold a section of the front line for a week during the closing stages of the First Battle of Ypres . However , the brigade did not see its first major action under Pinney 's command until 10 March 1915 , when it was committed to action as part of the Battle of Neuve Chapelle . The 23rd Brigade met heavy resistance when it began its attack , due to a failure by the divisional artillery to bombard a large section of the defenders ' trenches ; the 2nd Middlesex , making a frontal attack , were wiped out almost completely . The other lead battalion of the brigade , the 2nd Cameronians , was enfiladed from the undamaged sector and took heavy losses , losing almost all its officers and retreating in confusion . Pinney quickly learned of this — he was only two hundred yards from the front line — and decided to continue the attack . As he was not able to call for artillery support , the only possible approach was to send in the two reserve battalions . The second assault suffered heavy casualties at the outset , and quickly had to be called off when it was discovered that the corps artillery was about to fire on the positions being attacked ; the Devonshires and West Yorkshires were withdrawn , having taken high casualties and achieved little . After this , the attack continued to bog down , and whilst there was some success elsewhere in the divisional sector , nothing more was achieved by 23rd Brigade . Following Neuve Chapelle , the brigade was reinforced with two Territorial battalions . At the Battle of Aubers on 9 May , 23rd Brigade was held in reserve by 8th Division and so escaped the heavy casualties of the two attacking brigades . Around noon a scratch force of all available infantry was pushed forward by the divisional commander to support these two brigades , including some units of Pinney 's brigade .",

  "Though much of his work was made public only years later , Charles Ives had been exploring the possibilities of the tone cluster — which he referred to as the \" group chord \" — for some time .

  "After his death from cancer in 1941 his manuscripts were curated by his linguist friends who also worked to spread the influence of Whorf 's ideas on the relation between language , culture and cognition . Many of his works were published posthumously in the first decades after his death . In the 1960s Whorf 's views fell out of favor and he became the subject of harsh criticisms by scholars who considered language structure to primarily reflect cognitive universals rather than cultural differences . Critics argued that Whorf 's ideas were untestable and poorly formulated and that they were based on badly analyzed or misunderstood data . In the late 20th century , interest in Whorf 's ideas experienced a resurgence , and a new generation of scholars began reading Whorf 's works , arguing that previous critiques had only engaged superficially with Whorf 's actual ideas , or had attributed to him ideas he had never expressed .

Wheat was common all over Europe and was considered to be the most nutritious of all grains , but was more prestigious and thus more expensive . The finely sifted white flour that modern Europeans are most familiar with was reserved for the bread of the upper classes .

In times of grain shortages or outright famine , grains could be supplemented with cheaper and less desirable substitutes like chestnuts , dried legumes , acorns , ferns , and a wide variety of more or less nutritious vegetable matter .",

  "Cladistic analysis of morphological characters suggest that Pennatomys is most closely related to a clade , the Nectomys subclade , that includes members of Aegialomys , Amphinectomys , Nectomys , Sigmodontomys , Melanomys , Megalomys ( another Antillean rice rat ) , and possibly Nesoryzomys . However , the exact position of Pennatomys was poorly resolved because of missing data . Turvey and colleagues placed P. nivalis as the only member of its own genus because of its distinctive characters and the absence of evidence for close relationships with any other oryzomyine genus . Pennatomys probably belongs to a subgroup of Oryzomyini known as \" clade D \" . This clade contains a number of species only occurring on islands — including members of Aegialomys , Megalomys , Nesoryzomys , Noronhomys , Oryzomys , and Pennatomys . Turvey and colleagues suggested that this is related to the high proportion of semiaquatic species in clade D — most other oryzomyines are forest dwellers . As a whole , Oryzomyini includes over a hundred species in about thirty genera . It is one of several tribes within the subfamily Sigmodontinae of the family Cricetidae , which encompasses hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents , distributed chiefly in Eurasia and the Americas .

  "Ex @-@ Confederates were usually a safe voting bloc for the Democrats , but many of them deserted Goebel because he had , in 1895 , killed former Confederate general John Sanford in a duel .

Goebel also risked losing support to minor party candidates . Besides John Y.

  "With the phylogenetic classification , the taxon Labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a polyparaphyletic group without unique defining features apart from shared primitive characteristics . Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a stem @-@ based or a node @-@ based classification . Traditionally , amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage , while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians ( frogs , salamanders and caecilians ) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia . The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain , and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups , like the Temnospondyli ( traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia ) or the Lepospondyli , and in some analyses even in the amniotes .

If the contract included a provision that the money was to only be used for certain purposes , it could be interpreted that this money is held on trust until it is used for those purposes . The borrower would be a trustee ; using the money for any other purpose would be in violation of the trustee 's duties , and so void . This trust would be created as soon as the contract is agreed , with the normal requirement for it to be validly created . Two problems with this are that it has not been upheld by the English courts , and that the courts would require those explicit terms to be part of the contract ; Hudson considers it the most advantageous however , because it would offer the simplest protection of the money by not requiring the contract to be breached for the trust to come into existence .

  "After the stages of resection , strand invasion and DNA synthesis , the DSBR and SDSA pathways become distinct . The DSBR pathway is unique in that the second 3 ' overhang ( which was not involved in strand invasion ) also forms a Holliday junction with the homologous chromosome . The double Holliday junctions are then converted into recombination products by nicking endonucleases , a type of restriction endonuclease which cuts only one DNA strand . The DSBR pathway commonly results in crossover , though it can sometimes result in non @-@ crossover products ; the ability of a broken DNA molecule to collect sequences from separated donor loci was shown in mitotic budding yeast using plasmids or endonuclease induction of chromosomal events . Because of this tendency for chromosomal crossover , the DSBR pathway is a likely model of how crossover homologous recombination occurs during meiosis .",

  "Israelites enjoyed political independence twice in ancient history , first during the periods of the Biblical judges followed by the United Monarchy .

  "Cheetah are active mainly during the day , with hunting its major activity . Adult males are sociable despite their territoriality , forming groups called \" coalitions \" . Females are not territorial ; they may be solitary or live with their offspring in home ranges . Carnivores , cheetah mainly prey upon antelopes and gazelles . They will stalk their prey to within 100 – 300 metres ( 330 – 980 ft ) , charge towards it and kill it by tripping it during the chase and biting its throat to suffocate it to death . The cheetah 's body is specialised for speed ; it is the fastest land animal . The speed of a hunting cheetah averages 64 km / h ( 40 mph ) during a sprint ; the chase is interspersed with a few short bursts of speed , when the animal can clock 112 km / h ( 70 mph ) . Cheetahs are induced ovulators , breeding throughout the year . Gestation is nearly three months long , resulting in a litter of typically three to five cubs ( the number can vary from one to eight ) . Weaning occurs at six months ; siblings tend to stay together for some time . Cheetah cubs face higher mortality than most other mammals , especially in the Serengeti region . Cheetahs inhabit a variety of habitats – dry forests , scrub forests and savannahs .",

The 4th and 5th century Przeworsk societies had to cope with a deterioration of their traditional tribal social structure , caused by the accumulation of wealth and influence in the hands of the rich , the warriors , the tribal elders and rulers , who controlled the trade , imposed contributions and plundered . During these two centuries the number of the Przeworsk culture settlements and cemeteries generally decreases . There are also clear signs of the environment being overly exploited , which provided another motivation for the population to gradually leave . Most burials were getting more poorly equipped , in comparison with the previous periods . Late Przeworsk culture ceramic materials from Greater Poland show impoverishment and lack of differentiation of form , but on the other hand metal 5th century clasps , found at a variety of locations from eastern Lesser Poland , through eastern Greater Poland to Kujawy , demonstrate the usual for mature Germanic societies highest quality of workmanship .",

This increases the volume of the holds , and simplifies their structure which helps in loading , unloading , and cleaning . Double sides also improve a ship 's capacity for ballasting , which is useful when carrying light goods : the ship may have to increase its draft for stability or seakeeping reasons , which is done by adding ballast water .",

The Provisional Theatre 's chairman , František Rieger , had first accused Smetana of Wagnerist tendencies after the first performance of The Brandenburgers , and the issue eventually divided Prague 's musical society . The music critic Otakar Hostinský believed that Wagner 's theories should be the basis of the national opera , and argued that Dalibor was the beginning of the \" correct \" direction .

  "According to anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere , the cult of Kali reached Sri Lanka via South India . Although Kali shrines may have been part of Tamil Hindu temples prior to 12th century CE , the Sinhalese Buddhist population came to revere Kali as a village demon at least by the 12th century CE . The first known Hindu temple with a shrine to Kali to become popular with the Sinhalese Buddhists is Munneswaram . A myth that has Kali landing at the town of Chilaw , and residing in Munneswaram , has made the temple a popular place of visit for cursing and sorcery purposes . In the early 1970s , the majority of the Sinhalese visitors were there for sorcery purposes , but by the 1990s more than half have been visiting the temple for general veneration purposes , demonstrating the transformation of the deity from a malevolent demigod to a mother goddess . The veneration of Kali has completely overtaken the previously popular veneration of Pattini . Since the 1960s a number of Sinhalese Buddhist shrines dedicated to Kali have sprung up all over the island , especially in urban areas . These are managed by Sinhalese priests who are trance specialists and act as intermediaries between the deity and the devotee while being possessed by the deity . The popular veneration of previously Hindu deities such as Kali and Kataragama deviyo ( the latter identified with the Hindu Skanda ) have fundamentally altered the rational nature of Theravada Buddhism towards the Bhakti ( “ Personal veneration of deity ” ) aspect of Hinduism . Following protests by Buddhist monks and animal rights activist , the government banned the age old custom of animal sacrifices at the Kali temple in 2011 .",

In her writings , Workman described herself as \" questioning or violating the norms of Victorian female propriety \" .

Workman challenged a masculine realm ; her obituary in the Alpine Journal alluded to the challenges she faced , saying that she \" felt that she suffered from ' sex antagonism ' \" . The author of the piece added : \" it is possible that some unconscious feeling let us say of the novelty of a woman 's intrusion into the domain of exploration so long reserved to man , may in some quarters have existed ... there tended to arise ... an atmosphere shall we say of aloofness ? \" However , in her study of Victorian mountaineering , Ann Colley suggests that gender discrimination was more overt at lower elevations and in regular life than at higher elevations , such as in the Himalaya .
