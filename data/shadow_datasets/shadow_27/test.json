At the end of these two benefit periods , the hospice team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live . Following these two 90 day benefit periods , the hospice is then required to evaluate more closely and will review every 60 days . Commercial insurers , managed care program providers and Medicaid often have their own individual regulations regarding re @-@ certification .

  "The vegetables most commonly added to borscht are beetroots , white cabbage , carrots , parsley root , potatoes , onions and tomatoes . Some recipes may also call for beans , tart apples , turnip , celeriac , zucchini or bell peppers . Parsnip may be used as a substitute for parsley root , and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes . The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing , braising , boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock . This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven ( traditional masonry stove , used for both cooking and heating ) , wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had to be taken into account in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time . The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language , where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form borshchok rather than borshch . Vegetables are usually julienned , except for potatoes and zucchini , which are diced . The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables . Onions , carrots , parsley root , turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed ( traditionally in animal fat , especially lard or butter ) and then mixed with tomatoes or tomato paste . Dry beans are boiled separately . Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added .",

  "In the 17th century , the new method of modern science rejected Aristotle 's approach . It sought explanations of natural phenomena in terms of physical laws that were the same for all visible things and that did not require the existence of any fixed natural categories or divine cosmic order . However , this new approach was slow to take root in the biological sciences , the last bastion of the concept of fixed natural types . John Ray applied one of the previously more general terms for fixed natural types , \" species , \" to plant and animal types , but he strictly identified each type of living thing as a species and proposed that each species could be defined by the features that perpetuated themselves generation after generation . These species were designed by God , but showed differences caused by local conditions . The biological classification introduced by Carl Linnaeus in 1735 explicitly recognized the hierarchical nature of species relationships , but still viewed species as fixed according to a divine plan .",

  "The name \" Malawi \" comes from the Maravi , a Bantu people who emigrated from the southern Congo around 1400 AD . Upon reaching northern Lake Malawi , the group divided , with one group moving south down the west bank of the lake to become the group known as the Chewa , while the other group , the ancestors of today 's Nyanja , moved along the east side of the lake to the southern section of Malawi . Ethnic conflict and continuing migration prevented the formation of a society that was uniquely and cohesively Malawian until the dawn of the 20th century . Over the past century , ethnic distinctions have diminished to the point where there is no significant inter @-@ ethnic friction , although regional divisions still occur . The concept of a Malawian nationality has begun to form around a predominantly rural people who are generally conservative and traditionally nonviolent .",

In the climate of political change and upheaval that swept through Europe in that year , a pro @-@ democracy movement in Prague led by Smetana 's old friend Karel Havlíček was urging an end to Habsburg absolutist rule and for more political autonomy .

  "While most ants have poor eyesight , Myrmecia ants have excellent vision . This trait is important to them , since Myrmecia primarily relies on visual cues for navigation . These ants are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away . Winged alates are only active during the day , as they can see better . Members of a colony have different eye structures due to each individual fulfilling different tasks , and nocturnal species have larger ommatidia in comparison to those that are active during the day . Facet lenses also vary in size ; for example , the diurnal species M. croslandi has a smaller lens in comparison to M. nigriceps and M. pyriformis which have larger lenses . Myrmecia ants have three photoreceptors that can see UV light , meaning they are capable of seeing colours that humans cannot . Their vision is said to be better than some mammals , such as cats , dogs or wallabies . Despite their excellent vision , worker ants of this genus find it difficult to find their nests at night , due to the difficulty of finding the landmarks they use to navigate . They are thus more likely to return to their nests the following morning , walking slowly with long pauses .",

  "Heading into the new season , attention also focused on the McLaren team and its driver Nigel Mansell . He was initially announced as the partner of Mika Häkkinen ; however , a week before the first race , McLaren announced that Mansell would not compete in the first two races of the new season , as he could not fit into the MP4 / 10 car . Mansell 's arrival at McLaren was due to demand from the team 's sponsors , including Philip Morris , whose brand , Marlboro , was on the car , who wanted to enjoy the publicity associated with the 1992 World Champion 's return even if it meant him performing worse than teammate Häkkinen . His place at McLaren for the first two races was taken by the team 's test driver , Mark Blundell , as McLaren worked to build a wider monocoque to accommodate Mansell . McLaren were also concerned about the standard refuelling equipment provided for 1995 by suppliers Intertechnique , having suffered a major leak in a test of the new rig outside of its factory . Intertechnique had redesigned the fuel equipment , which was used by all of the teams , in the wake of a pit lane fire suffered by driver Jos Verstappen during the previous year 's German Grand Prix . The new fuel rigs , in addition to being half the size of the 1994 , also featured longer nozzles , and were designed to lock onto the car before any fuel could begin to flow . Intertechnique traced the problem to a faulty valve within the equipment , which caused 10 kilograms ( 22 lb ) of fuel to leak , and modified the parts accordingly . Intertechnique and the FIA advised the teams to refuel the cars slowly and carefully during pitstops to avoid any further leaks , a situation that was considered unsatisfactory by many of the team principals and mechanics . A new regulation for 1995 also mandated the teams ' fuel suppliers to send samples of their fuel to the FIA prior to each Grand Prix , which the governing body would use as a reference when conducting fuel tests at the event itself . Thus only fuel approved by the FIA in advance was allowed ; any deviations from the samples on file was not permitted . As before , all cars were subject to routine fuel tests as part of the scrutineering process throughout the weekend to ensure compliance with the sport 's technical regulations . The rule change had been proposed by the Elf oil company in 1993 and unanimously supported by the other F1 suppliers in order to speed up the fuel @-@ testing process .",

  "Following the takeover of Liverpool F.C. on 6 February 2007 by George Gillett and Tom Hicks , the proposed stadium was redesigned . In November 2007 the redesigned layout was approved by the council , and construction was due to start in early 2008 . The new stadium , provisionally called Stanley Park Stadium , was to be built by HKS , Inc .. It was scheduled to open in August 2011 with a capacity of 60 @,@ 000 . If the new stadium is built , Anfield would be demolished . The land would become home to the centrepiece for the Anfield Plaza development , which would include a hotel , restaurants , and offices . However , the construction of Stanley Park was delayed following the economic crisis of 2008 and the subsequent recession , which directly affected the then American owners . The situation was worsened because the club was bought with borrowed money , not the owners ' capital , and interest rates were higher than expected . Hicks and Gillett promised to begin work on the stadium within 60 days of acquisition of the club , but had trouble financing the estimated £ 500 million needed for the Stanley Park development . The deadline passed and the plan was eventually cancelled by the Fenway Sports Group , as their preference was to re @-@ develop the Anfield .",

  "In 1775 , Fort Ticonderoga 's location did not appear to be as strategically important as it had been in the French and Indian War , when the French famously defended it against a much larger British force in the 1758 Battle of Carillon , and when the British captured it in 1759 . After the 1763 Treaty of Paris , in which the French ceded their North American territories to the British , the fort was no longer on the frontier of two great empires , guarding the principal waterway between them .

  "In the post @-@ Reformation period there was a criminalisation of women . Women were disciplined in kirk sessions and civil courts for stereotypical offenses including scolding and prostitution , which were seen as deviant , rather than criminal . Through the 1640s there were independent commissions set up to try women for child murder and , after pressure from the kirk , a law of 1690 placed the presumption of guilt on a woman who concealed a pregnancy and birth and whose child later died . In the aftermath of the initial Reformation settlement , Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563 , similar to that passed in England one year earlier , which made the practice of witchcraft itself and consulting with witches capital crimes . Between the passing of the act and its repeal in 1736 , an estimated 6 @,@ 000 persons were tried for witchcraft in Scotland .

Changing attitudes to women , particularly in the reformed kirk , which may have perceived women as more of a moral threat , have also been noted . The proliferation of partial explanations for the witch hunt has led some historians to proffer the concept of \" associated circumstances \" , rather than one single significant cause .",

  "The story draws heavily on the tradition of the romance , and it was influenced by tragicomedy , the courtly masque and perhaps the commedia dell 'arte . It differs from Shakespeare 's other plays in its observation of a stricter , more organised neoclassical style . Critics see The Tempest as explicitly concerned with its own nature as a play , frequently drawing links between Prospero 's \" art \" and theatrical illusion , and early critics saw Prospero as a representation of Shakespeare , and his renunciation of magic as signalling Shakespeare 's farewell to the stage . The play portrays Prospero as a rational , and not an occultist , magician by providing a contrast to him in Sycorax : her magic is frequently described as destructive and terrible , where Prospero 's is said to be wondrous and beautiful . Beginning in about 1950 , with the publication of Psychology of Colonization by Octave Mannoni , The Tempest was viewed more and more through the lens of postcolonial theory — exemplified in adaptations like Aimé Césaire 's Une Tempête set in Haiti — and there is even a scholarly journal on post @-@ colonial criticism named after Caliban .",

  "A more fundamental problem lies in the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations that govern the atmosphere . It is impossible to solve these equations exactly , and small errors grow with time ( doubling about every five days ) . Present understanding is that this chaotic behavior limits accurate forecasts to about 14 days even with perfectly accurate input data and a flawless model . In addition , the partial differential equations used in the model need to be supplemented with parameterizations for solar radiation , moist processes ( clouds and precipitation ) , heat exchange , soil , vegetation , surface water , and the effects of terrain . In an effort to quantify the large amount of inherent uncertainty remaining in numerical predictions , ensemble forecasts have been used since the 1990s to help gauge the confidence in the forecast , and to obtain useful results farther into the future than otherwise possible .

Later previews showed that the game had changed significantly and contained gameplay more in line with that found in the previous titles in the series . The changes were well received by video game journalists .

  "Cancer cells with BRCA mutations have deficiencies in homologous recombination , and drugs to exploit those deficiencies have been developed and used successfully in clinical trials . Olaparib , a PARP1 inhibitor , shrunk or stopped the growth of tumors from breast , ovarian and prostate cancers caused by mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes , which are necessary for HR . When BRCA1 or BRCA2 is absent , other types of DNA repair mechanisms must compensate for the deficiency of HR , such as base @-@ excision repair ( BER ) for stalled replication forks or non @-@ homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) for double strand breaks . By inhibiting BER in an HR @-@ deficient cell , olaparib applies the concept of synthetic lethality to specifically target cancer cells . While PARP1 inhibitors represent a novel approach to cancer therapy , researchers have cautioned that they may prove insufficient for treating late @-@ stage metastatic cancers . Cancer cells can become resistant to a PARP1 inhibitor if they undergo deletions of mutations in BRCA2 , undermining the drug 's synthetic lethality by restoring cancer cells ' ability to repair DNA by HR .",

  "In 1961 , the third species , P. cyrtocristatus was named by John Ostrom . Its three known specimens , have been found in the Fruitland and Kaiparowits formations from Utah and New Mexico . The second specimen , the first known from the Kaiparowits Formation , was originally unassigned to a specific taxon . Of the Parasaurolophus species , P. cyrtocristatus it is the smallest , and has the most curved crest . Because of its possession of the two above features , it has often been speculated that it was a female of P. walkeri or P. tubicen , which were males , although P. tubicen lived approximately a million years later . As noted by Thomas Williamson , the type material of P. cyrtocristatus is about 72 % the size of P. tubicen , close to the size at which other lambeosaurines are interpreted to begin showing definitive sexual dimorphism in their crests ( ~ 70 % of adult size ) . Even though many scientists have supported the possible fact of P. cyrtocristatus being a female , many other studies have found that it is not , because of the differences in age , distribution , and the large differences in the crest and its internal structure .",

  "The earliest known published reference for the word Wicca is within an advertisement published in a 1962 issue of Fate magazine ; in this , a Cardiff @-@ based group of Pagan Witches advertised a tradition as \" Wicca – Dianic and Aradian \" . The advert may have been linked to Charles and Mary Cardell because Mary was allegedly born in Wales and Cardellian Witchcraft had apparently venerated a goddess under the name of Diana . However , many Pagan Witchcraft groups would have adopted the deity name Diana and Aradia , these being the goddesses featured in the American folklorist Charles Leland 's supposed account of a Tuscan witch tradition , Aradia , or the Gospel of the Witches ( 1899 ) . Another early use could be found from December 1965 , in the penultimate issue of Pentagram , the newsletter of the Witchcraft Research Association . Here , a small column on Halloween made reference to \" the Craft of the Wiccan \" , apparently referring to the entire Pagan Witchcraft community . The author 's name was not printed , although it had probably been produced by one of the figures involved in editing Pentagram , such as Gerard Noel or Doreen Valiente .

Meanwhile , the Greeks ( for the most part Peloponnesians ) prepared to defend the Isthmus of Corinth , demolishing the single road that led through it and building a wall across it . As at Thermopylae , to make this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade , barring the passage of the Persian navy across the Saronic Gulf , so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese . However , instead of a mere blockade , Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet .

In 817 , he was sent by Louis to Turin to act as bishop . It has been suggested that the appointment of a theologian and scholar to a post such as Turin , which had attendant military duties due to the threat of Saracen raids , was largely based on the need for an imperial supporter in Italy in light of the rebellion of Bernard . Bernard was the illegitimate son of King Pepin , the third son of Charlemagne . Louis gave Italy to his eldest son Lothair when the empire was partitioned among his three sons in 817 .

  "While the urban United States experienced an economic boom during the 1920s , the agricultural sector of the country experienced a depression . Disruption of European agriculture by World War I had produced high prices for farm commodities , and it had been thought that Europe 's recovery would be slow and that the high prices would persist . This gave rise to a bubble in farmland prices , which burst when the rapid postwar recovery of European agriculture drove commodity prices down again . At the same time , increasing mechanization reduced the need for farm labor , pushing agricultural wages downward and rural unemployment upward . Madison and St. Leonard 's parish suffered from this agricultural depression and from the Great Depression of the 1930s . During this time , the parish 's population remained more or less stable : in 1918 , it consisted of 440 individuals ; in 1929 , 452 .",

With this , the only 2nd AIF troops remaining in Australia were those of the 23rd Brigade . As a result of concerns about Japanese intentions in the region , the decision was made to move the brigade north to bolster the defences around Darwin in the Northern Territory . In the event of fighting in the Pacific , the government planned to split infantry battalions , to defend the island chain to Australia ’ s north , dispatching forces to Rabaul , Ambon and Timor . The role of the corps troops from the 2 / 4th Pioneers and 2 / 4th Machine Gun Battalion remained uncertain . The 8th Division ’ s commander , Major General Gordon Bennett , unhappy with the dispersal of his command , had been agitating for the dispatch of the machine gunners to Malaya to support his two infantry brigades , arguing that they would be valuable for beach defence . Bennett 's request had been rejected initially in March , due to the limited numbers of recruits enlisting but by mid @-@ September , elements at Army headquarters in Melbourne had also begun to advocate for it . In early October , following a War Cabinet decision to split the command of the 8th Division in two , removing the elements in Australia from Bennett 's command , the 2 / 4th Machine Gun Battalion received orders to move north to Darwin , where it was to serve in a home defence role in case of a Japanese attack .",

  "Conceptual thinking about throffers is practically applied in considerations of conditional aid , such as is used in workfare systems . For philosopher and political theorist Gertrude Ezorsky , the denial of welfare when subjects refuse work is the epitome of a throffer . Conditional welfare is also labelled a throffer by political philosopher Robert Goodin . In the words of Daniel Shapiro , also a political philosopher , the offer aspect of workfare is seen in the \" benefits one receives if one learns new skills , gets a job , alters destructive behaviors and the like \" , while the threat aspect is executed with \" the elimination or reduction of aid , if the person does not , after a certain period of time , accept the offer \" . For Goodin , the moral questionability of the threat aspect of a throffer is generally mitigated by the attractiveness of the offer aspect . In this way , workfare can represent a \" genuine \" throffer , but only when a person receiving welfare payments does not need the payments to survive , and so possesses a genuine choice as to whether to accept the throffer . When , however , an individual would be unable to survive if he or she stopped receiving welfare payments , there is no genuine choice ; the individual is , for Goodin , unable to refuse the throffer . This cancels out the morally mitigating factor usually possessed by a throffer . This is presented as an argument against workfare , and Goodin anticipates that advocates would respond paternalistically by claiming that , regardless of issues of freedom , the individual in question would benefit from taking part in the work or education offered .",

The road commission used state matching grants from the Michigan Department of Transportation to complete the financing needed to pave the roadway .

  "During the last years of the Wanli era and those of his two successors , an economic crisis developed that was centered on a sudden widespread lack of the empire 's chief medium of exchange : silver . The Portuguese first established trade with China in 1516 , trading Japanese silver for Chinese silk , and after some initial hostilities gained consent from the Ming court in 1557 to settle Macau as their permanent trade base in China . Their role in providing silver was gradually surpassed by the Spanish , while even the Dutch challenged them for control of this trade . Philip IV of Spain ( reigned 1621 – 1665 ) began cracking down on illegal smuggling of silver from New Spain and Peru across the Pacific through the Philippines towards China , in favor of shipping American @-@ mined silver through Spanish ports . In 1639 the new Tokugawa regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers , cutting off another source of silver coming into China . These events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of silver and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces . People began hoarding precious silver as there was progressively less of it , forcing the ratio of the value of copper to silver into a steep decline . In the 1630s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver ; by 1640 that sum could fetch half an ounce ; and , by 1643 only one @-@ third of an ounce . For peasants this meant economic disaster , since they paid taxes in silver while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper .",

  "Richards identifies in Formby \" an innocence that was essentially childlike ... which explains why George was as popular with children as he was with adults \" ; Igoe agrees , and writes that \" we know he loves children , because himself he is a child \" . Formby 's screen and stage persona of innocence and simplicity was not seen as ignorance or stupidity , although Basil Dean disagreed and thought that Formby \" didn 't act gormless as many successful Lancashire comedians have done , he was gormless \" . Much of the innocence in Formby 's performance is connected to sex , and the use of double entendres within his songs . John Caughie and Kevin Rockett , in their examination of British film , and Richards , see a connection between Formby 's approach to sex and the saucy seaside postcards of Donald McGill . Richards sees the function of Formby 's humour as being the same as McGill 's : \" the harmless diffusion of a major source of tension in a deeply repressed and conventional society \" . Formby 's delivery of the sexual content — what McFarlane identifies as being \" sung with such a toothy grin and air of innocence \" — negated any possible indignation , and this contrasts with the more overtly sexual delivery of other performers of the time , such as Max Miller and Frank Randle .",

  "The new American possession of Puerto Rico found itself in financial woes soon after its acquisition — its principal export , coffee , was now barred by high tariffs from both Spanish and American markets . Foraker took the lead in drafting and pressing legislation establishing a civil government for the island . Although Foraker had proposed to eliminate tariffs on imports from Puerto Rico , to secure passage of the legislation he had to accept a rate of 15 % for two years as the island developed a taxation system , after which there would be no tariff , and the money would be used to develop the island .

  "Another effect of the mission was the promotion of the cult of Pope Gregory the Great by the Northumbrians amongst others ; the first Life of Gregory is from Whitby Abbey in Northumbria .

Gregory , in Bede 's work , is the driving force behind the Gregorian mission , and Augustine and the other missionaries are portrayed as depending on him for advice and help in their endeavours . Bede also gives a leading role in the conversion of Northumbria to Gregorian missionaries , especially in his Chronica Maiora , in which no mention is made of any Irish missionaries . By putting Gregory at the centre of the mission , even though he did not take part in it , Bede helped to spread the cult of Gregory , who not only became one of the major saints in Anglo @-@ Saxon England , but continued to overshadow Augustine even in the afterlife ; an Anglo @-@ Saxon church council of 747 ordered that Augustine should always be mentioned in the liturgy right after Gregory .",

  "According to Brothwell , Lindow Man is one of the most complex examples of \" overkill \" in a bog body , and possibly has ritual meaning as it was \" extravagant \" for a straightforward murder . Archaeologists John Hodgson and Mark Brennand suggest that bog bodies may have been related to religious practice , although there is division in the academic community over this issue . In the case of Lindow Man , scholars debate whether the killing was murder or done as part of ritual . Anne Ross , an expert on Iron Age religion , proposed that the death was an example of human sacrifice and that the \" triple death \" ( throat cut , strangled , and hit on the head ) was an offering to several different gods . The wide date range for Lindow Man 's death ( 2 BC to 119 AD ) means he may have met his demise after the Romans conquered northern England in the 60s AD . As the Romans outlawed human sacrifice , such timing would open up other possibilities . This conclusion was emphasised by historian Ronald Hutton , who challenged the interpretation of sacrificial death . Connolly suggests that as Lindow Man was found naked , he could have been the victim of a violent robbery .",

  "When Gervase Markham published his Cavalarice , or the English Horseman in 1617 , farmers were not only using pack horses , farm horses and cart horses , but were also breeding horses for saddling and driving . Markham recommended crossing native horses with other breeds for particular purposes , for example suggesting Turks or Irish Hobbies as an outcross to produce riding animals , Friesland and Flanders horses to produce light driving animals , and German heavy draught horses to produce heavy haulage animals . Horse fairs were numerous , and some of the earliest mentions of specific breeds , such as Cleveland horses and Suffolk Punch horses , date from this time . Large Dutch horses were imported by King William III ( 1650 – 1702 ) when he discovered that existing cart horses did not have the strength for the task of draining the Fens . These horses became known as Lincolnshire Blacks , and the English heavy draught horses of today are their descendants . By the middle of the 17th century , the reputation of the British horse throughout Europe had become so good that , according to Sir Jonas Moore in 1703 , \" since the peace treaty with France , farmers had been offered by Frenchmen three times the accustomed price for their horses \" .",
  "In his analysis of King Priam , Bowen argues that the change in Tippett 's musical style arose initially from the nature of the opera , a tragedy radically different in tone from the warm optimism of The Midsummer Marriage . Clarke sees the change as something more fundamental , the increases in dissonance and atonality in Priam being representative of a trend that continued and reached a climax of astringency a few years later in Tippett 's third opera , The Knot Garden . Tippett 's new modernistic language , writes Clarke , was rooted in his desire to represent a wider range of human experiences , characteristic of a changing world : \" War , violence , sex , homoeroticism , and social and interpersonal alienation [ would now feature ] much more overtly in [ his ] dramatic works or works with text \" . Critics acknowledged Priam as a considerable achievement , but received the new musical style cautiously . While Gloag thought the change was not an absolute departure from Tippett 's earlier style , Milner viewed King Priam as a complete break with Tippett 's previous work , pointing out the lack of counterpoint , the considerably increased dissonances , and the move towards atonality : \" very little of the music is in a definite key \" .",
  "The Lobata have a pair of lobes , which are muscular , cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth . Their inconspicuous tentacles originate from the corners of the mouth , running in convoluted grooves and spreading out over the inner surface of the lobes ( rather than trailing far behind , as in the Cydippida ) . Between the lobes on either side of the mouth , many species of lobates have four auricles , gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth . This combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey .",
  "A mated pair usually constructs a nest by improving a crevice by dropping sticks into it ; it is then built on top of the platform formed . This behaviour has led to the blocking of chimneys and even resulted in nests crashing down into fireplaces , sometimes with birds still on them . Nest platforms can attain a great size . John Mason Neale notes that a \" Clerk was allowed by the Churchwarden to have for his own use all that the caddows had brought into the Tower : and he took home , at one time , two cart @-@ loads of good firewood , besides a great quantity of rubbish which he threw away . \" In his The Natural History of Selborne , Gilbert White notes that western jackdaws used to nest in crevices beneath the lintels of Stonehenge , and describes an example of the bird using a rabbit burrow for nesting . The species has been recorded outcompeting the tawny owl ( Strix aluco ) for nest sites in the Netherlands . They can take over old nest sites of the black woodpecker ( Dryocopus martius ) and stock dove ( Columba oenas ) .

  "Although strongly urged by Moderates to sign the Civil Rights Bill , Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27 .

  "The largest French resupply effort of the Napoleonic Wars was a squadron under Contre @-@ Admiral Corentin @-@ Urbain Leissègues , sent to Santo Domingo in December 1805 with troops and supplies . In conjunction with a second squadron under Vice @-@ Admiral Jean @-@ Baptiste Willaumez , this force was then ordered to raid British trade routes and disrupt the movement of British merchant shipping across the Atlantic . Leissègues reached Santo Domingo in February 1806 , but within days a British battle squadron had intercepted and destroyed his force at the Battle of San Domingo . Willaumez was able to avoid attack by British forces during the spring of 1806 , and cruised in the Caribbean during much of the summer , but his force was eventually dispersed by a hurricane in August and the survivors forced to shelter on the American Eastern Seaboard . Unaware of the dispersal of Willaumez 's squadron , the British naval authorities sought to block its return to Europe by stationing strong battle squadrons off the principal French Atlantic ports . One of their most important targets was the city of Rochefort , heavily fortified port in which a powerful French naval force was based , and a squadron of six Royal Navy ships of the line was assigned to watch it in case Willaumez attempted to return there . In August , command of the blockade squadron was awarded to Commodore Sir Samuel Hood , a highly experience naval commander .",

Castaing 's edge lettering machine was used on the overstruck coins , and the Royal Mint supervisor Martin Masselin , the individual who undertook the process , was obligated to pay Castaing for its use . In 1691 , Masselin was dismissed , as he and his clerks were found to have stolen from the Mint during the reformation of the coinage , and Castaing was appointed to perform the edge lettering and restriking in his place .

  "In a lively exchange over what has come to be referred to as \" the Chinese room argument \" , John Searle sought to refute the claim of proponents of what he calls \" strong artificial intelligence ( AI ) \" that a computer program can be conscious , though he does agree with advocates of \" weak AI \" that computer programs can be formatted to \" simulate \" conscious states . His own view is that consciousness has subjective , first @-@ person causal powers by being essentially intentional due simply to the way human brains function biologically ; conscious persons can perform computations , but consciousness is not inherently computational the way computer programs are . To make a Turing machine that speaks Chinese , Searle imagines a room with one monolingual English speaker ( Searle himself , in fact ) , a book that designates a combination of Chinese symbols to be output paired with Chinese symbol input , and boxes filled with Chinese symbols . In this case , the English speaker is acting as a computer and the rulebook as a program . Searle argues that with such a machine , he would be able to process the inputs to outputs perfectly without having any understanding of Chinese , nor having any idea what the questions and answers could possibly mean . If the experiment were done in English , since Searle knows English , he would be able to take questions and give answers without any algorithms for English questions , and he would be effectively aware of what was being said and the purposes it might serve . Searle would pass the Turing test of answering the questions in both languages , but he is only conscious of what he is doing when he speaks English . Another way of putting the argument is to say that computer programs can pass the Turing test for processing the syntax of a language , but that the syntax cannot lead to semantic meaning in the way strong AI advocates hoped .",

  "A training establishment for parachute troops was set up at RAF Ringway , near Manchester , on 21 June 1940 and named the Central Landing Establishment , and the initial 500 volunteers began training for airborne operations . A number of gliders were being designed and constructed by the Royal Air Force , which had also provided a number of Armstrong Whitworth Whitley medium bombers for conversion into transport aircraft . Organizational plans were also being laid down , with the War Office calling for two parachute brigades to be operational by 1943 . However , the immediate development of any further airborne formations , as well as the initial 500 volunteers already training , was hampered by three problems . With the threat of invasion in 1940 , many War Office officials and senior British Army officers did not believe that sufficient men could be spared from the effort to the rebuild the Army after the Battle of France to create an effective airborne force ; many believed that such a force would only have a nuisance raiding value and would not affect the conflict in any useful way . There were also material problems ; all three of the armed services were expanding and rebuilding , particularly the Army , and British industry had not yet been organised to a sufficient war footing to support all three services as well as the fledgling airborne force . Finally , the airborne forces lacked a single , coherent policy , with no clear idea as to how they should be organised , or whether they should come under the command of the Army or the RAF ; inter organizational rivalry between the War Office and the Air Ministry , in charge of the RAF , was a major factor in delaying the further expansion of British airborne forces .",

Francis 's despair after Alan 's murder can likewise be compared to that of the many soldiers who survived the war but saw their friends die on the battlefield . Kaes noted other parallels between the film and war experiences , noting that Cesare attacked Alan at dawn , a common time for attacks during the war .

The commercial showed a couple in a vintage porsche pulling in front of an ATM cash machine . The man makes a transaction while the woman looks at VH1 playing at a store , showing \" Take a Bow \" . When the man turns back to the car , the woman is gone and can be seen inside the video along side Madonna , while the singer appears in the car , and utters the tagline : \" The new VH1 ... It 'll suck you in \" . According to Abbey Konowitch , who worked on Madonna 's Maverick Records , the singer had a long history with MTV and VH1 , and hence was eager to participate in the campaign when asked by VH1 president John Sykes . For filming the commercial , the cloths worn in the video had to be flown in from the different designers . Madonna was also impressed by the technology used in the commercial for transposing the woman and herself together .",

  "Hippeastrum hybrids and cultivars are valued for their large ornamental flowers , particularly for indoor cultivation during the northern hemisphere winter . The larger the bulb , the more flowers it will produce . The largest bulbs measure 14 to 16 inches ( 36 to 41 cm ) in circumference and will produce three or more scapes ( flower stems ) with four or more blooms each . The commonest bulbs measure 10 ½ to 12 ½ inches ( 27 to 32 cm ) with two scapes with four to six flowers each depending on the cultivar . Some bulbs put up two flower scapes at the same time ; others may wait several weeks between blooms and sometimes the second scape will have only two or three flowers rather than the usual four . A bulb needs to produce large , healthy leaves in the summer growing season before it can send up a scape the following year . Bulbs are often described by the country of origin of the bulb producers , since they may have different characteristics , e.g. ' Dutch Amaryllis ' , ' South African Amarylllis ' . Dutch bulbs usually produce flowers first , then , after they have finished blooming ( hysteranthous ) , the plant will begin growing leaves . Bulbs from the South African growers usually put up a scape and leaves at the same time ( synanthous ) .",

This includes both negative actions and the absence of action , and as such covers discipline , dismissal , or failing to gain a pay rise or access to facilities which would otherwise have been provided . If an employee does suffer a detriment , he is permitted to make a complaint before an employment tribunal under Section 3 . In front of an employment tribunal , the law is amended in Sections 4 and 5 to provide compensation , and to reverse the burden of proof ; if an employee has been dismissed for making a protected disclosure , this dismissal is automatically considered unfair . Similarly , under Section 6 , an employee cannot be given priority when discussing redundancies simply because he made such a disclosure . These sections take into account Section 7 , which notes that there is no requirement of age or length of employment before they come into effect .",

  "Many endemic Mascarene birds , including the dodo , are derived from South Asian ancestors , and the English palaeontologist Julian Hume has proposed that this may be the case for all the parrots there as well . Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene , so it was possible for species to colonise some of the then less isolated islands . Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known , subfossil remains show that they shared features such as enlarged heads and jaws , reduced pectoral bones , and robust leg bones . Hume has suggested that they have a common origin in the radiation of the tribe Psittaculini , basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean . The Psittaculini may have invaded the area several times , as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea . A 2011 genetic study instead found that the Mascarene parrot ( Mascarinus mascarinus ) of nearby Réunion was most closely related to the lesser vasa parrot ( Coracopsis nigra ) from Madagascar and nearby islands , and therefore unrelated to the Psittacula parrots , undermining the theory of their common origin .",

  "As with the 54th and 55th Presidential Inaugurations , in 2001 and 2005 , respectively , the 56th Presidential Inauguration in 2009 was designated as a National Special Security Event ( NSSE ) , resulting in the United States Secret Service being the lead Federal agency for the development and implementation of the overall security plan ; the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) being the lead Federal agency for counter terrorism , intelligence , and criminal investigation ; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) being the lead Federal agency for crisis management in the aftermath of any terrorist attack , natural disaster or other catastrophic incident . The United States Capitol Police had primary responsibility for security and emergency response within the Capitol Complex to include the Inaugural Platform and the Inaugural Luncheon . The NSSE designation was made by Michael Chertoff , Secretary of Homeland Security , on December 10 , 2008 . The inauguration took place in an era of enhanced security in the decade following the September 11 attacks . Because of the size of the crowds expected in Washington , D.C. for the inaugural activities , planners raised concerns about public safety and security . Army General Richard Rowe , head of the joint military task force for the Washington , D.C. area , explained that security forces had to stretch their imagination to anticipate previously unthinkable security threats , especially in light of the Mumbai attacks in India that occurred in November 2008 .

  "In recent years , historians such as Harry Jaffa , Herman Belz , John Diggins , Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln 's redefinition of republican values . As early as the 1850s , a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution , Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values — what he called the \" sheet anchor \" of republicanism . The Declaration 's emphasis on freedom and equality for all , in contrast to the Constitution 's tolerance of slavery , shifted the debate . As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860 , \" Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself . \" His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism , rather than its legalisms . Nevertheless , in 1861 , Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms ( the Constitution was a contract , and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree ) , and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state . Burton ( 2008 ) argues that Lincoln 's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated .",

  "In a memorable event , Metternich argued with Napoleon at Napoleon 's 39th birthday celebrations in August 1808 over the increasingly obvious preparations for war on both sides . Soon after , Napoleon refused Metternich 's attendance at the Congress of Erfurt ; Metternich was later glad to hear from Talleyrand that Napoleon 's attempts at the Congress to get Russia to invade Austria had proved unsuccessful . In late 1808 Metternich was recalled to Vienna for five weeks of meetings about the possibility of Austria invading France while Napoleon was on campaign in Spain . His memoranda reported that France was not united behind Napoleon , that Russia was unlikely to want to fight Austria , and that France had few reliable troops that could fight in central Europe .

Despite heavy German fire from both sides of the river , the British successfully sank Newbridge across one of the delta mouths on 10 November , though the German raider could still put to sea via other channels . Looff decided to move his ship further upriver , to make it more difficult for the British to destroy her . In doing so , his ship would occupy a disproportionate number of British vessels that could otherwise have been employed elsewhere . In the course of the campaign , the British reinforced the squadron blockading the Rufiji with additional cruisers , including Pyramus and the Australian HMAS Pioneer .",

  "Davies attempts to both create imagery and to provide a social commentary in his scripts ; for example , he uses camera directions in his scripts more frequently than newer screenwriters to ensure that anyone who reads the script , especially the director , is able to \" feel ... the pace , the speed , the atmosphere , the mood , the gags , [ and ] the dread \" . His stage directions also create an atmosphere by their formatting and avoidance of the first person . Although the basis of several of his scripts derive from previous concepts , he claims that most concepts for storytelling have been already used , and instead tries to tell a relatively new and entertaining plot ; for example , the Doctor Who episode \" Turn Left \" shares its concept most notably with the 1998 film Sliding Doors . Like how Sliding Doors examines two timelines based on whether Helen Quilley ( Gwyneth Paltrow ) catches a London Underground train , Davies uses the choice of the Doctor 's companion to turn left or right at a road intersection to depict either a world with the Doctor , as seen throughout the rest of the fourth series , or an alternate world without the Doctor , examined in its entirety within the episode . The world without the Doctor creates a dystopia which he uses to provide a commentary on Nazi @-@ esque fascism . Davies generally tries to make his scripts \" quite detailed , but very succinct \" , and eschews the long character and set descriptions ; instead , he limits himself to only three adjectives to describe a character and two lines to describe a set to allow the dialogue to describe the story instead .",

  "The crescent honeyeater is arboreal , foraging mainly among the foliage and flowers in the understory and tree canopy on nectar , fruits and small insects . It has been recorded eating the honeydew of psyllids , soft scale and felt scale insects . It feeds primarily by probing flowers for nectar , and gleaning foliage and bark and sallying for insects . While regularly observed feeding singly or in pairs , the crescent honeyeater has also been recorded moving in loose feeding flocks , and gathering in large groups at productive food sources . A study in forest near Hobart in Tasmania found that the crescent honeyeater 's diet was wholly composed of insects during the breeding season , but nectar was a significant component during winter . Insects consumed include moths and flies , and the tree trunks were the site of foraging around two thirds of the time , and foliage a third . It fed on nectar as plants came into flower in the autumn and winter , and then foraged in Tasmanian blue gum ( Eucalyptus globulus ) during the breeding season in spring . The flowering of royal grevillea ( Grevillea victoriae ) over summer in subalpine areas in the Snowy Mountains attracted large numbers of crescent honeyeaters . It feeds intensively when sources are plentiful and when feeding on flame heath ( Astroloma conostephioides ) it was recorded visiting an average of 34 flowers per minute . Other plants it has been recorded visiting include a number of Banksia species , waratah ( Telopea ) , tubular flowered genera including Astroloma , Epacris and Correa , mistletoes of the genus Amyema , and eucalypts in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia .

  "The type fossils were first studied by paleoentomologists David Grimaldi , Donat Agusti , and James Carpenter of the American Museum . The team 's 1997 type description of the new genus and species was published in the journal American Museum Novitates . The genus name was coined by them as a patronym honoring the ant systemist William L. Brown , Jr. who co @-@ described the first Cretaceous ant genus and species Sphecomyrma freyi . The specific epithet clavata was chosen as a reference to the distinctive clubbed antennae seen in the workers . Grimaldi , Agusti , and Carpenter placed the new genus into the extant ant subfamily Ponerinae , without tribal assignment , based on a slight constriction of the gaster . They also noted several features that are shared with ants of the amblyoponine group , then a part of Ponerinae . The workers have genal spurs on the lower edge area under the small compound eyes . Workers also have narrow long mandibles , as do some amblyoponine genera . Placement in Ponerinae was unchanged until a revision of the subfamily was published in 2003 by myrmecologist Barry Bolton . In that paper the subfamily was shown to be a paraphylectic grouping and many of the included genera were moved to separate subfamilies , including the amblyoponines and Brownimecia . Due to the unique combination of morphological features found in Brownimecia , Bolton erected the new subfamily Brownimeciinae for the genus . Bolton notes that its sickle @-@ like mandibles which lack teeth are not usual for ants and are often associated with dulotic , or slave @-@ making , behavior in extant genera . In contrast to stem group ants such as the sphecomyrmines , the scapes of Brownimecia workers are more elongated like those of crown group ants . In his 2007 phylogenetic examination of Formicidae , entomologist Philip Ward notes the possibility that Brownimecia is a crown group genus and placed the subfamily into the informal \" poneroid \" grouping in his phylogony .",

  "When receptive to mating , a female blacktip reef shark swims slowly in a sinusoidal pattern near the bottom with her head pointed down ; observations in the wild suggest female sharks release chemical signals that allow males to track them . Once the male finds her , he closes to around 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) and follows her with his snout oriented towards her vent . A courting male may also bite the female behind her gills or on her pectoral fins ; these mating wounds heal completely after 4 – 6 weeks . After a period of synchronous swimming , the male pushes the female on her side and positions her so her head is against the bottom and her tail is raised .

  "Cuba 's burgeoning tourist industry of the late 1990s benefited from this rebirth of interest . According to The Economist , \" In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous . It 's as if you were to go to Liverpool and find bands singing Beatles songs on every street corner . \" The songs Buena Vista sings are often not their own compositions . Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street . Despite the appeal of the \" Buena Vista \" ambience to tourists , Cubans themselves were less aware of the \" Buena Vista Social Club \" than international music listeners . This was due to the foreign nature of the production , and the dominance of modern Timba , Songo and other musical forms on the island , such as reggaetón by luminaries such as Raul Zeballos , the creator of the genre . Some explain that Buena Vista did not impact the Cuban audience , as they were not creating anything new ; they were just playing the same songs that Cubans know and have been playing for many years .",

  "Social identity theory is best described as a theory that predicts certain intergroup behaviours on the basis of perceived group status differences , the perceived legitimacy and stability of those status differences , and the perceived ability to move from one group to another .

It was awareness of the limited scope of social identity theory that led John Turner and colleagues to develop a cousin theory in the form of self @-@ categorization theory , which built on the insights of social identity theory to produce a more general account of self and group processes .

  "The Confession starts with the doctrine of revelation , or how people can know about God . The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature as well as the Bible , but they also believed that the Bible , or Scripture , is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of God . The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time . Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew vowel points , marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation , of the Old Testament were probably not part of the original . This caused significant debate between Reformed polemicists and Roman Catholics . Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative magisterium to interpret the Bible as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of perspicuity , that the essential teachings of the Bible could be interpreted by anyone . English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine . The divines had a strong view of the inspiration of the Bible , and believed that God revealed himself in the propositions found in Scripture . While the issue of biblical inerrancy , the belief that there are no errors in the Bible , did not arise until the eighteenth century , the divines clearly did not believe the Bible to contain any errors . Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration , believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the Hebrew text were inspired by God . On the other hand , they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles . They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration .",

  "The ε ring is the brightest and densest part of the Uranian ring system , and is responsible for about two @-@ thirds of the light reflected by the rings . While it is the most eccentric of the Uranian rings , it has negligible orbital inclination . The ring 's eccentricity causes its brightness to vary over the course of its orbit .

  "Once part of the supercontinent Gondwana , the island of Madagascar has been isolated since it broke away from eastern Africa ( ~ 160 mya ) , Antarctica ( ~ 80 – 130 mya ) , and India ( ~ 80 – 90 mya ) . Since ancestral lemurs are thought to have originated in Africa around 62 to 65 mya , they must have crossed the Mozambique Channel , a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560 km ( 350 mi ) . In 1915 , paleontologist William Diller Matthew noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar ( including lemurs ) can only be accounted for by random rafting events , where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation , which get flushed out to sea from major rivers . This form of biological dispersal can occur randomly over millions of years . In the 1940s , American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term \" sweepstakes hypothesis \" for such random events . Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar , but until recently this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong ocean currents flow away from the island . In January 2010 , a report demonstrated that around 60 mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1 @,@ 650 km ( 1 @,@ 030 mi ) south of their present @-@ day positions , placing them in a different ocean gyre , producing currents that ran counter to what they are today . The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today , which would have pushed a raft along faster , shortening the trip to 30 days or less — short enough for a small mammal to survive easily . As the continental plates drifted northward , the currents gradually changed , and by 20 mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed , effectively isolating the lemurs and the rest of the terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa . Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors , the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving arboreal mammalian groups , such as squirrels . They were also spared from having to compete with monkeys , which evolved later . The intelligence , aggression , and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment .",

A separate corporate entity called Kellex was created for the project , headed by Percival C. Keith , one of Kellogg 's vice presidents . The process faced formidable technical difficulties . The highly corrosive gas uranium hexafluoride had to be used , as no substitute could be found , and the motors and pumps would have to be vacuum tight and enclosed in inert gas . The biggest problem was the design of the barrier , which would have to be strong , porous and resistant to corrosion by uranium hexafluoride . The best choice for this seemed to be nickel . Edward Adler and Edward Norris created a mesh barrier from electroplated nickel . A six @-@ stage pilot plant was built at Columbia to test the process , but the Norris @-@ Adler prototype proved to be too brittle . A rival barrier was developed from powdered nickel by Kellex , the Bell Telephone Laboratories and the Bakelite Corporation . In January 1944 , Groves ordered the Kellex barrier into production .",

The impeachment was the first since 1459 without the king 's official sanction in the form of a bill of attainder . The incident set an important precedent as the process of impeachment would later be used against Charles and his supporters : the Duke of Buckingham , Archbishop Laud , and the Earl of Strafford . James insisted that the House of Commons be concerned exclusively with domestic affairs , while the members protested that they had the privilege of free speech within the Commons ' walls , demanding war with Spain and a Protestant Princess of Wales . Charles , like his father , considered the discussion of his marriage in the Commons impertinent and an infringement of his father 's royal prerogative . In January 1622 , James dissolved Parliament , angry at what he perceived as the members ' impudence and intransigence .",

  "West 's arguments have been highly influential , but other scholars have arrived at different conclusions using the same evidence . Fowler thinks that the Sicyon genealogy would more likely reflect a composition before Cleisthenes ' death ( c . 575 ) and dates the poem to the period closely following the First Sacred War , connecting its content to the growing influence of the Amphictyonic League and placing its author in Aeolian Thessaly because of the Aeolid family @-@ trees centered around that region which dominate the earlier portions of the poem . Hirschberger , on the other hand , takes this focus upon the Aeolids and the Catalogue poet 's perceived interest in eastern peoples to be indicative of a poet from Aeolis in Asia Minor ; she proposes that the Catalogue was composed there between 630 and 590 , viewing the composition of the Shield of Heracles and an apparent allusion to the poem by Stesichorus ( died c . 555 ) as providing the ultimate terminus ante quem .",
  "As a publican Baker supported Governor William Bligh 's attempts to regulate liquor imports , and signed a letter to this effect in 1807 . Despite this , he publicly welcomed Bligh 's overthrow in the 1808 Rum Rebellion and congratulated former Marines officer George Johnston for helping seize executive authority on behalf of the New South Wales Corps . In so doing he drew the attention of Bligh 's replacement , Governor Lachlan Macquarie , who commenced an investigation into accusations that Baker had unfairly treated Hawkesbury settlers by appropriating supplies from the government store . The accusations were upheld and in 1810 Baker was dismissed from all his government posts .

The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street . Construction was completed in 1843 . Within the next few years , the number of Catholics in the parish grew significantly , partly due to the emigration of people from neighbouring Macau . The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline , and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in the young and prospering colony of Hong Kong .",

Furthermore , existing observation networks have poor coverage in some regions ( for example , over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean ) , which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere . While a set of equations , known as the Liouville equations , exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization , the equations are too complex to run in real @-@ time , even with the use of supercomputers . These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about five or six days into the future .",

Bowdoin was cast by Hancock supporters as unpatriotic , citing among other things his refusal to serve in the First Continental Congress ( even though it was due to his illness ) . Bowdoin 's supporters , who were principally well @-@ off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities , cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace .

  "Many methods for introducing DNA sequences into organisms to create recombinant DNA and genetically modified organisms use the process of homologous recombination . Also called gene targeting , the method is especially common in yeast and mouse genetics . The gene targeting method in knockout mice uses mouse embryonic stem cells to deliver artificial genetic material ( mostly of therapeutic interest ) , which represses the target gene of the mouse by the principle of homologous recombination . The mouse thereby acts as a working model to understand the effects of a specific mammalian gene . In recognition of their discovery of how homologous recombination can be used to introduce genetic modifications in mice through embryonic stem cells , Mario Capecchi , Martin Evans and Oliver Smithies were awarded the 2007 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine .",

  "On May 3 , 1938 , Crawford — along with Greta Garbo , Norma Shearer , Luise Rainer , and John Barrymore , Katharine Hepburn , Fred Astaire , Dolores del Río and others — was dubbed \" Box Office Poison \" in an open letter in the Independent Film Journal .

  "A \" mulligan \" rule was introduced into the game , first informally in casual play and then in the official game rules . The modern \" Paris mulligan \" allows players to shuffle an unsatisfactory opening hand back into the deck at the start of the game , draw a new hand with one fewer card , and repeat until satisfied , after which any player who has taken a mulligan may look at the top card of his or her deck and either return it or put it at the bottom of the deck . In multiplayer , a player may take one mulligan without penalty , while subsequent mulligans will still cost one card ( a rule known as \" Partial Paris mulligan \" ) . The original mulligan allowed a player a single redraw of seven new cards if that player 's initial hand contained seven or zero lands . A variation of this rule called a \" forced mulligan \" is still used in some casual play circles and in multiplayer formats on Magic Online , and allows a single \" free \" redraw of seven new cards if a player 's initial hand contains seven , six , one or zero lands .",

  "Himmler used the Jesuits as the model for the SS , since he found they had the core elements of absolute obedience and the cult of the organisation . Hitler is said to have called Himmler \" my Ignatius of Loyola \" . As an order , the SS needed a coherent doctrine that would set it apart . Himmler attempted to construct such an ideology , and deduced a \" pseudo @-@ Germanic tradition \" from history . Himmler dismissed the image of Christ as a Jew and rejected Christianity 's basic doctrine and its institutions . In a 1936 memorandum , he set forth a list of approved holidays based on pagan and political precedents meant to wean SS members from their reliance on Christian festivities . Starting in 1934 , the SS hosted \" solstice ceremonies \" ( Sonnenwendfeiern ) to increase team spirit within their ranks . In an attempt to replace Christianity within the SS with the new doctrine , SS @-@ men were able to choose special Lebenslauffeste , substituting common Christian ceremonies such as baptisms , weddings and burials . Since the ceremonies were held in small private circles , it is unknown how many SS @-@ members opted for these kind of celebrations .",

  "Harald also wanted to re @-@ establish Magnus 's rule over Denmark , and in the long term probably sought to restore Cnut the Great 's \" North Sea Empire \" in its entirety . While his first proposal to invade Denmark fell through , the next year Harald embarked on what would turn into constant warfare against Sweyn , from 1048 almost yearly until 1064 . Similar to his campaigns ( then together with Sweyn ) against Magnus 's rule in Denmark , most of his campaigns against Sweyn consisted of swift and violent raids on the Danish coasts . In 1048 , he plundered Jutland , and in 1049 he pillaged and burned Hedeby , at the time the most important Danish trade center , and one of the best protected and most populous towns in Scandinavia . Hedeby as a civil town never recovered from Harald 's destruction , and was left completely desolate when what remained was looted by Slavic tribes in 1066 . One of two conventional battles was set to be fought between the two kings later the same year , but according to Saxo Grammaticus , Sweyn 's smaller army was so frightened when approached by the Norwegians that they chose to jump in the water trying to escape ; most drowned . Although Harald was victorious in most of the engagements , he was never successful in occupying Denmark .",
  "From 1950 to 1952 , there were a series of disputes between EES director Rosselot and Georgia Tech vice president Cherry Emerson over the station 's finances and Rosselot 's hand in founding Scientific Associates . When it was founded in October 1951 , Rosselot was president and CEO of Scientific Associates ; at issue was the potential conflict of interest with his role at Georgia Tech , and what , if any , role Georgia Tech should have in technology transfer to the marketplace . Emerson later instituted a policy requiring EES employees wishing to work with Scientific Associates to make a written request to the president of Georgia Tech . However , Rosselot 's participation in Scientific Associates ' founding and early operations ensured the eventual success of Scientific Atlanta and facilitated subsequent technology transfer by Georgia Tech 's VentureLab and the Advanced Technology Development Center .",
  "Allmusic 's Steve Huey asserts that the album \" reache [ s ] all the way back to his earliest recordings for musical inspiration while telling topical stories about corruption — political and social — the erasure and the rewriting of American history , and an emerging class war . \" Peter Kane of Q compares it to Cooder 's 1971 album Into the Purple Valley , which featured Dust Bowl @-@ era songs , and writes that this album 's \" protest songs for today 's messed @-@ up world \" are \" sly and humorous \" .

  "Poe wrote the poem as a narrative , without intentionally creating an allegory or falling into didacticism . The main theme of the poem is one of undying devotion . The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember . He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss . The narrator assumes that the word \" Nevermore \" is the raven 's \" only stock and store \" , and , yet , he continues to ask it questions , knowing what the answer will be . His questions , then , are purposely self @-@ deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss . Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually knows what it is saying or if it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem 's narrator . The narrator begins as \" weak and weary , \" becomes regretful and grief @-@ stricken , before passing into a frenzy and , finally , madness . Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron , an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded , locked @-@ out lover at the sealed door of his beloved .",
