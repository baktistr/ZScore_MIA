These territories are maintained throughout the year , with animals usually separated by a distance of about 100 – 400 m ( 330 – 1 @,@ 310 ft ) , but this can vary according to the quality of the habitat . In favourable conditions , this distance is as little as 9 m ( 30 ft ) , but can be as large as 1 @,@ 600 m ( 5 @,@ 200 ft ) in poor habitat . Each bull has a patch of ground in the centre of his territory in which he regularly drops dung , and in which he performs acts of display . These include urinating , scraping , pawing and rolling on the ground and thumping it with his horns - all of which demonstrate his prowess to other bulls . An encounter between two bulls involves elaborate rituals . Estes coined the term \" Challenge Ritual \" to describe this behaviour for the blue wildebeest , but this is also applicable to the black wildebeest , owing to the close similarity in the behaviour in both species . The bulls approach each other with their heads lowered , resembling a grazing position ( sometimes actually grazing ) . This is usually followed by movements like standing in a reverse @-@ parallel position , in which one male urinates and the opponent smells and performs flehmen , after which they may reverse the procedure . During this ritual or afterwards the two can toss their horns at each other , circle one another , or even look away . Then begins the fight , which may be of low intensity ( consisting of interlocking the horns and pushing each other in a standing position ) or high intensity ( consisting of their dropping to their knees and straining against each other powerfully , trying to remain in contact while their foreheads are nearly touching the ground ) . Threat displays like shaking the head may also take place .",
  "For the return match between NSW and the British Isles on 25 June , each side made four changes . In the opening period , the sides were evenly matched but eventually the British scored a try in the corner , which was converted , and a second try soon after took them eight points clear . The visitors were up 13 – 0 at half time after another converted try : the home side had made numerous attacking attempts but had failed to cross the line . The second half started as the first had ended , with NSW dominating , but they failed to score ; instead , the British managed to counter @-@ attack to score another converted try .

  "An initial Austrian attack on the French position at Bruchsal favored the French , who charged the Austrians with bayonets . Again , on 5 and 6 September , the Austrians spent most of the day skirmishing with the French at their advanced posts , masking their intention of circling around Bruchsal and marching south to secure the crossing to Strasbourg . General Scherb received intelligence of a contingent of infantry and cavalry marching against him and retired south . Scherb found the Austrians already in possession of Untergrombach , a village south of Bruchsal . After he tried to force his way through , the Austrians fell back to Weingarten at 49 ° 3 ′ 5 ″ N 8 ° 31 ′ 50 ″ E.

  "Wood Style ( 木遁 , Mokuton , lit . \" Wood Release \" ) is the kekkei genkai of Hashirama Senju . By combining earth and water @-@ based chakra , the user can produce trees or wooden objects from any surface . This allowed the First Hokage , Hashirama Senju , to create the foundation of Konohagakure . The objects created with the Wood Style vary in detail , ranging from a simple wall to a functioning copy of the user . During Part II , it was revealed that Yamato received the ability to use Wood Style techniques after being injected with Hashirama 's DNA by Orochimaru , though at a much lesser scale . A possibly unrelated technique , but unique to the First Hokage and Yamato , is the ability to suppress a tailed beast . This is accomplished by producing wooden poles from the ground that attach to the beast and force its chakra to recede . Similar to Yamato , Danzō Shimura also had Hashirama 's DNA injected into him by Orochimaru , granting him the ability to use Wood Style techniques , but only to a limited amount as Danzō can not have too much implanted as he would have been killed . Madara Uchiha is revealed to have successfully injected Hashirama 's DNA into him as well , becoming a genetic match to the Sage of the Six Paths and had used it to save his apprentice Obito Uchiha from dying . White Zetsu and those mutated from being assimilated by the Shinju also possess Wood Style , with Madara deceived into thinking that they are essentially artificial humans he created through Hashirama 's DNA .

  "Descartes ' argument crucially depends on the premise that what Seth believes to be \" clear and distinct \" ideas in his mind are necessarily true . Many contemporary philosophers doubt this .

Freud claimed that a psychologically @-@ trained observer can understand a person 's unconscious motivations better than the person himself does . Duhem has shown that a philosopher of science can know a person 's methods of discovery better than that person herself does , while Malinowski has shown that an anthropologist can know a person 's customs and habits better than the person whose customs and habits they are . He also asserts that modern psychological experiments that cause people to see things that are not there provide grounds for rejecting Descartes ' argument , because scientists can describe a person 's perceptions better than the person herself can . The weakness common to all these arguments against interactionism is that they put all introspective insight in doubt . We know people make mistakes about the world ( including another 's internal states ) , but not always . Therefore , it is logically absurd to assume persons are always in error about their own mental states and judgements about the nature of the mind itself .",

I am proposing the establishment of a third . ” Winters , in speaking of Very ’ s relations with Emerson and his circle , concluded , “ The attitude of the Transcendentalists toward Very is instructive and amusing , and it proves beyond cavil how remote he was from them . In respect to the doctrine of the submission of the will , he agreed with them in principle ; but whereas they recommended the surrender , he practised it , and they regarded him with amazement . ” Subsequently , William Irving Bartlett , in 1942 , outlined the basic biographical facts of Very ’ s life in Jones Very , Emerson ’ s “ Brave Saint . ” A complete scholarly edition of Very ’ s poetic works belatedly appeared , over a century after the poet ’ s death , in 1993 .",

In 1860 , Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis described the species Geastrum biplicatum ( originally named Geaster biplicatus ) , based on specimens sent to them by Charles Wright that he obtained from the Bonin Islands during the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition . Japanese mycologist Sanshi Imai considered this identical with G. pectinatum in a 1936 publication . In 1959 , mycologist J.T.

  "Originally a fast @-@ medium bowler — a style to which he sometimes reverted when Surrey were short of bowlers — Fender 's main bowling style was wrist spin , and he could spin the ball effectively . He gripped the ball differently from most wrist spinners , using his thumb and first two fingers , and would attempt any kind of unorthodox delivery if he thought it might be effective . To deceive the batsman he varied the position from which he bowled and the height of his arm , and occasionally bowled deliberate full tosses or long hops to surprise them . Fender hoped that , in his eagerness to score from an apparently innocuous ball , the batsman would mis @-@ hit , a tactic he would often try when the batsman was playing defensively . Fender 's love of experimentation and his surprise variations made him difficult for batsmen to face , but produced inconsistent results and he sometimes conceded many runs . His Wisden obituary suggests that Fender would have been better employed as a \" fourth or fifth bowler in a strong bowling side \" , but Surrey 's weakness in bowling meant that he had to do far more work than was ideal for his style and approach . Despite his experimentation , critics regarded him as a reliable bowler using his primary method , and The Times described him as \" subtle in flight and with artful variations \" .",

  "Henrietta Swan Leavitt ( July 4 , 1868 – December 12 , 1921 ) was an American astronomer who discovered the relation between the luminosity and the period of Cepheid variable stars . A graduate of Radcliffe College , Leavitt started working at the Harvard College Observatory as a \" computer \" in 1893 , examining photographic plates in order to measure and catalog the brightness of stars . Though she received little recognition in her lifetime , it was her discovery that first allowed astronomers to measure the distance between the Earth and faraway galaxies . She explained her discovery : \" A straight line can readily be drawn among each of the two series of points corresponding to maxima and minima , thus showing that there is a simple relation between the brightness of the variables and their periods . \" After Leavitt 's death , Edwin Hubble used the luminosity – period relation for Cepheids together with spectral shifts first measured by fellow astronomer Vesto Slipher at Lowell Observatory to determine that the universe is expanding ( see Hubble 's law ) .",

  "Although most mutations that change protein sequences are harmful or neutral , some mutations have a beneficial effect on an organism . These mutations may enable the mutant organism to withstand particular environmental stresses better than wild type organisms , or reproduce more quickly . In these cases a mutation will tend to become more common in a population through natural selection . Viruses that use RNA as their genetic material have rapid mutation rates , which can be an advantage , since these viruses will evolve constantly and rapidly , and thus evade the defensive responses of e.g. the human immune system .

Crittenden had expressed his desire to retire from public service and initially refused pleas to become a candidate , but he finally consented to run in late May . He was elected over secessionist candidate William E. Simms ; in all , nine of Kentucky 's ten congressional districts selected Unionist candidates in the special election . Upon taking his seat , he was assigned to the Committee on Foreign Affairs . On July 10 , 1861 , he accompanied Simon B. Buckner on a visit to President Lincoln to secure a renewed commitment from Lincoln to respect Kentucky 's neutrality ; Lincoln agreed only to issue a declaration that he had no present designs on Kentucky but would not commit to restrict his future actions . In order to calm the fears of border state citizens concerned about the Union 's objectives in the war , he introduced the Crittenden – Johnson Resolution , which blamed the secessionist states for the war and stated that the object of the war was not the subjugation of those states , but the defense of the Constitution and the preservation of the Union . When those ends were achieved , the resolution stated , the war should cease . Kentucky Representative Henry C. Burnett asked that the question be divided . Burnett was one of only two votes against the portion of the resolution blaming the Southern states for the war ; the only dissent on the remaining portion came from Wisconsin 's John F. Potter and Ohio 's Albert G. Riddle . In the Senate , the resolution passed 30 – 5 , with Kentucky senators Breckinridge and Powell voting in the minority . In December 1861 the House refused , by a vote of 76 – 65 , to reaffirm the resolution .",

  "Throughout the imperial Roman period , Sicily was a quiet , prosperous backwater . Only in the 5th century did it suffer from raids by the Vandals operating from the coasts of North Africa . In 535 , the island came under Byzantine control and was raided by the Ostrogoths in the Gothic War , but calm returned thereafter . Protected by the sea , the island was spared the ravages inflicted on Byzantine Italy through the Lombard invasions of the late 6th and early 7th centuries , and retained a still flourishing urban life and a civilian administration . It was only the increasing threat of the Muslim expansion that thrust it into the limelight .

  "When Governor Shirley 's political opponents engineered his recall in 1757 , Hutchinson sought and received the endorsement of the British military leader Lord Loudoun in an effort to succeed Shirley as governor . During this time Hutchinson was the leading politician in the province due to the age and infirmity of Lieutenant Governor Spencer Phips . Hutchinson 's application was unsuccessful , but he did receive an appointment as lieutenant governor in 1758 , serving under Thomas Pownall . Hutchinson 's relationship with Pownall was awkward , for Pownall was at the center of political activities that dislodged Governor Shirley , under whose patronage Hutchinson had risen in power and influence . Pownall cultivated relations with the populist factions in the state , and sought to remove the influence of Shirley supporters , sometimes asking Hutchinson to turn against people he ( Hutchinson ) had earlier supported . This Hutchinson refused to do , since he saw these actions as harming the province 's stability and taking place at \" the caprice of the governor \" .

He could be 10 feet tall , so everything , even his hair , better look good ! \" Typically , a limited number of motion performances are captured and Massive is used to create further variety , such as in height and walking speed . Because the digital extras were required to be close to the foreground , and to integrate them properly with the live action extras , House of Moves captured twice as much motion data than CIS had used on any other project . CIS created nine distinct digital characters . To eliminate inaccuracies that develop when creating a digital extra of different proportions to the motion capture performer , CIS sent nine skeleton rigs to House of Moves before work began . This gave House of Moves time to properly adapt the rigs to its performers , resulting in motion capture data that required very little editing in Massive .

  "Because of his father 's success in business and his mother 's descent from Hawaiian royalty , the Pitman family was considered quite prosperous and were host to the royal family when they visited Hilo . Besides being one of the leading merchants in town , his father also served the government as district magistrate of Hilo . Henry 's mother , Kinoʻole , had inherited control over much of the lands in Hilo and Ōlaʻa from her own father , and King Kamehameha III had granted her use of the ahupuaʻa of Hilo after her marriage . During Henry 's early childhood , the family lived in the mansion that Benjamin Pitman had built in 1840 , in an area known as Niopola , one of the favored resort spots of ancient Hawaiian royalty .

The council was a virtually full @-@ time institution by the late 15th century , and surviving records from the period indicate it was critical in the working of royal justice .

  "The French Lives provided Shelley with a way to celebrate literary women , particularly salonniéres . In her life of Madame de Sévigné , Shelley celebrates \" her chaste widowhood ; her loyalty as a friend ; [ and ] her maternal devotion \" . However , Orr writes that it is difficult to see a pattern in the way Shelley addresses gender issues in these volumes . She argues that \" the most consistent ' feminism ' displayed throughout [ the second volume of French Lives ] lies in her examination of French attitudes toward love , marriage , and sexuality \" . Shelley sympathetically portrays customs such as taking lovers , explaining the custom in the context of France 's arranged marriages . Overall , Orr explains , Shelley 's \" historical sympathy for the varied circumstances of women 's relationships mirrors her personal practice of understanding and assisting those of her women friends who transgressed moral norms \" . The biographies of Roland and Staël focus on their abilities and the social forces that both helped and hindered them from succeeding . Shelley argues that women are as intellectually capable as men , but lack a sufficient education and are trapped by social systems such as marriage that restrict their rights . The emphasis that Shelley places on education and reading reflect the influence of her mother 's A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1792 ) . In these two biographies , Shelley reinforces contemporary gender roles while at the same time celebrating the achievements of these women . She describes Roland through traditionally feminine roles :",

  "Van der Weyden 's depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany , identified by the time of Pope Gregory I as the repentant prostitute of Luke 7 : 36 – 50 . She then became associated with weeping and reading : Christ 's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful . Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes , associating tears with words , and in turn weeping with reading . Examples can be seen in 16th @-@ century works by Tintoretto and Titian which show the Magdalen reading , often with her eyes averted towards her book ( and presumably away from a male gaze ) , or looking up to the heavens or , sometimes , glancing coyly towards the viewer . Writing in \" The Crying Face \" , Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden 's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a \" pictorial formula for crying \" .",

  "Following the Boer War there were calls for the disbandment of the cavalry by such notable persons as the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Forces Lord Roberts and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle . Between 1900 and 1903 the cavalry 's share of the army budget was cut from six to under 4 @.@ 5 per cent , and recruiting for the cavalry was suspended for a year . Added to this , the Commonwealth Defence Act 1903 proposed a force of nine brigades formed by a militia , with six of the brigades planned to be mounted infantry known as light horse . In the same year , Lord Roberts appointed Robert Baden @-@ Powell of the 5th Dragoon Guards to the position of Inspector General of Cavalry , a surprising choice as Roberts had earlier described him as being \" certainly not a General \" . Within the year , Baden @-@ Powell was endorsing a change in policy , recommending that instead of countering an enemy charge with a countercharge of their own , the cavalry should dismount and engage them with rifle fire . For cavalry to survive , by necessity British cavalry doctrine had to change , as the emphasis was now on dismounted firepower and cavalry charges that were supported by covering fire from the flanks , by their own machine guns , and the guns of the Royal Horse Artillery ( RHA ) . To support this change in policy , cavalrymen were now required to do two hours rifle or sword practice a day . This made them just as proficient as the infantry with their rifles . In 1908 one regiment , the 14th Hussars , recorded having 354 marksmen , 212 first class shots , thirty @-@ five second class , and only four third class shots .",

  "The Polish brigade was withdrawn to Nijmegen and helped defend the airborne corridor before returning to England in early October . Shortly afterward , the British began making Sosabowski and the Polish Brigade a scapegoat for the failure at Arnhem , perhaps to cover their own failings . On 17 October , Montgomery informed Alan Brooke — Chief of the Imperial General Staff — that he felt the Polish forces had \" fought very badly \" at Arnhem and that he did not want them under his command . Author David Bennett observes that Montgomery had almost certainly been fed gross misinformation that supported his own prejudices . A month later , Browning wrote a long and highly critical letter of Sosabowski to Brooke 's deputy . In it , he accused Sosabowski of being difficult , unadaptable , argumentative and \" loth to play his full part in the operation unless everything was done for him and his brigade \" . It is possible that Browning himself wanted to make Sosabowski a scapegoat , although it may equally have been the work of officers of the 43rd Division . Browning recommended that Sosabowski be replaced - suggesting Lieutenant Colonel Jachnik or Major Tonn - and in December the Polish government in exile duly dismissed him in a move almost certainly made under British pressure . Although it may be fair to say that Sosabowski was difficult to work with , his scapegoating is judged as disgraceful by many historical commentators . Brian Urquhart — who had done so much to warn his superiors about the dangers of Arnhem — described the criticism of Sosabowski and the brigade as \" grotesque \" and that his dismissal was a \" shameful act \" .",
  "On the extreme south of the Grebbe Line , the Grebbeberg , the Germans were now deploying three SS battalions including support troops and three fresh infantry battalions of IR.322 ; two of IR.374 laid in immediate reserve . During the evening and night of 12 – 13 May the Dutch had assembled in this sector about a dozen battalions . These forces consisted of the reserve battalions of several army corps , divisions and brigades , and the independent Brigade B , which had been freed when the Main Defence Line in the Land van Maas en Waal had been abandoned as part of the withdrawal of III Army Corps from North Brabant . However , not all of these units would be concentrated into a single effort for a counterattack to retake the main line . Some battalions had been fed immediately into the battle at the Stop Line and others were kept in reserve , mainly behind the fall @-@ back line near the Rhenen railroad . Furthermore , most battalions were a quarter below strength . Four were to be used , under command of Brigade B , for the flanking attack from the north . This attack was delayed for several hours ; when it finally started late in the morning of 13 May , it ran right into a comparable advance by two battalions of Der Fuehrer . This brigade , unaware of Dutch intentions , had shifted its attack axis to the north to roll up the Grebbe Line from behind . A confused encounter fight followed in which the vanguard of the Dutch troops , poorly supported by their artillery , began to give way at around 12 : 30 to the encroaching SS troops . Soon this resulted in a general withdrawal of the brigade , which turned into a rout when the Grebbeberg area was after 13 : 30 bombed by 27 Ju 87 Stukas .",

  "Given the superficial similarities between the two flags , the Italian flag and the Mexican flag have been compared over time . However , the Italian tricolour actually uses lighter shades of green and red and , more importantly , the two have different aspect ratios ; the Italian flag 's aspect ratio is 2 : 3 , while the Mexican flag 's aspect ratio of 4 : 7 results in a more elongated rectangular shape .

  "Attempts were also made to improve navigation on the lower river . Between 1677 and 1678 , Sir John Moulton cut a new channel at \" Vikings Creek \" on the Horsey Levels to remove a large meander ; the old river bed soon silted up , providing 120 acres ( 49 ha ) of new land . A further scheme was proposed in 1723 to improve navigation , shorten the journey time for boats , and recover land by obtaining an Act of Parliament to make an artificial cut across the Steart Peninsula . Eventually , after much debate , the cut was not made due to lack of land owner support and concerns over costs and risks . The English Civil War put a stop to most reclamation work ; however , in 1764 a clyse was built at Dunball to contain tidal influences on a run @-@ off stream near King 's Sedgemoor . Extensive land recovery was undertaken in the Somerset Levels by land owners between 1770 and the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , as part of a general scheme of agricultural improvements , including improvements to the Brue Valley and to King 's Sedgemoor . The latter involved the connection of various drainage schemes into a new hand @-@ dug channel connected to the clyse at Dunball – the King 's Sedgemoor Drain .

  "Although the earliest Pipe roll dates from 1130 , the 31st year of King Henry I 's reign , it is clear that they were being produced by the Exchequer before then , as the 1130 roll is not an experiment .

An extract from an earlier Pipe roll , from the 25th regnal year of Henry I or 1124 , has been found in a 14th @-@ century manuscript now in the Cotton Library at the British Museum . Exactly when the Pipe rolls began to be produced is debated amongst historians . Some hold that they date from Henry I 's reign , whether early or late in the reign , but others feel that they were introduced by King William I ( reigned 1066 – 1087 ) . The precursors of the records probably date to the Anglo @-@ Saxon period , as the historian Pauline Stafford argues that financial records must have been kept in some form during the reigns of Cnut ( reigned 1016 – 1035 ) , Æthelred II ( reigned 978 – 1016 ) , and Edgar the Peaceable ( reigned 959 – 975 ) . There is a reference to the king 's \" rolls \" in a writ from 1110 , which purports to be a grant from Henry I to the abbot of Westminster of ten shillings , but the writ may be a forgery , or parts of it may be genuine with some interpolations .

  "In June 1399 , Louis , Duke of Orléans , gained control of the court of the insane Charles VI of France .

With a small group of followers , Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in Yorkshire towards the end of June 1399 . Men from all over the country soon rallied around the duke . Meeting with Henry Percy , Earl of Northumberland , who had his own misgivings about the king , Bolingbroke insisted that his only object was to regain his own patrimony . Percy took him at his word and declined to interfere . The king had taken most of his household knights and the loyal members of his nobility with him to Ireland , so Henry experienced little resistance as he moved south .

  "Vane lost his position to the elder John Winthrop in the 1637 election .

The relentless expansion of the Palace of Whitehall , which was by now a sprawling jumble of structures , had hemmed in the Privy Garden behind walls and buildings on all sides .

  "Both direct and indirect ways have been found to indicate the presence of a wake depression . The most direct is through the use of surface observations . Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks , or mesonets , it was difficult to find wake lows . With the advent of mesoscale networks , wake lows have become easier to find .

  "Susie Bright described some of the specifically lesbian themes of the film . One is the concept of the hand as a sex organ , highlighted by lingering camera shots of Corky and Violet 's hands . Another is the repeated use of water as a symbolic motif to represent women , present for example when Corky is retrieving Violet 's earring from the sink . Bright describes it as a movie that is \" wet \" ( feminine ) as opposed to \" hard \" ( masculine ) . She says the scene where Corky and Violet have their first conversation is full of \" lesbian signs \" . She highlights the fact that Violet , away from Caesar , is wearing jeans and able to be less overtly feminine . Jennifer Tilly says that whenever Violet is talking to men , her voice becomes high @-@ pitched and \" girly \" — making her seem vulnerable and ensuring she is taken care of . Joe Pantoliano agrees , saying that the result is that \" everyone in the film wants to be with Violet \" . When she is with Corky , Violet can drop the act and talk at a more natural pitch . According to Bright , the more subtle lesbian themes of the film were noticed and appreciated at the LGBT film festival screenings .",

For example , Palmer developed \" the distractor \" , which he used to test if the material shown on Sesame Street captured young viewers ' attention . Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory ; they were shown an episode on a television monitor and a slide show next to it . The slides would change every seven seconds , and researchers recorded when the children 's attention was diverted away from the episode .

It was thus most unlikely that the parties had left the maritime features in the Singapore Straits outside their spheres of influence , as Singapore had contended . Under Article XII of the Treaty , Britain had agreed that \" no British Establishment shall be made on the Carimon Isles , or on the Island of Bantam , Bintang , Lingin , or on any of the other Islands South of the Straits of Singapore ... \" The islands and islets within the Straits therefore fell within the British sphere of influence . This included Pedra Branca , which remained part of the territorial domain of the new Johor Sultanate .

  "A vitamin is an organic compound needed in small quantities that cannot be made in cells .

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ( NAD + ) , a derivative of vitamin B3 ( niacin ) , is an important coenzyme that acts as a hydrogen acceptor . Hundreds of separate types of dehydrogenases remove electrons from their substrates and reduce NAD + into NADH . This reduced form of the coenzyme is then a substrate for any of the reductases in the cell that need to reduce their substrates . Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide exists in two related forms in the cell , NADH and NADPH . The NAD + / NADH form is more important in catabolic reactions , while NADP + / NADPH is used in anabolic reactions .",

  "Aluminum and magnesium are most often welded using alternating current , but the use of direct current is also possible , depending on the properties desired . Before welding , the work area should be cleaned and may be preheated to 175 to 200 ° C ( 347 to 392 ° F ) for aluminum or to a maximum of 150 ° C ( 302 ° F ) for thick magnesium workpieces to improve penetration and increase travel speed . AC current can provide a self @-@ cleaning effect , removing the thin , refractory aluminum oxide ( sapphire ) layer that forms on aluminum metal within minutes of exposure to air . This oxide layer must be removed for welding to occur . When alternating current is used , pure tungsten electrodes or zirconiated tungsten electrodes are preferred over thoriated electrodes , as the latter are more likely to \" spit \" electrode particles across the welding arc into the weld . Blunt electrode tips are preferred , and pure argon shielding gas should be employed for thin workpieces .

  "Another combat timing mechanic featured in the game is the \" Charge Meter \" , which allows players to increase the power of spells or attacks by spending additional time preparing them . This meter is always used for spell casting , as well as when using the \" Charge Attack \" skill used by the \" Monk \" class . Although players can choose to act immediately , an ability will become more powerful the longer that the player charges the attack . However , the greater the amount of time one charges attacks , the longer the charging character must wait before the next turn . As a result of this , players can choose to charge up an ability so that the ability triggers shortly before an enemy acts , or can instead aim for the \" sweet spot \" , a special red area on the charging bar , indicating a charge that allows for less time until the next attack , as well as a smaller mana cost . Overall , deciding on the correct amount of charge and letting go of the button at precisely that time can greatly influence the effectiveness of each character 's attacks during combat .",

  "As part of the work , an earth mound , or motte , 17 @-@ foot ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) high , was piled up around the base of the tower . The original ground floor of the castle was now an underground cellar , probably used as a puteus , or pit , for detaining low status prisoners and reached by ladder from the first floor . Some infilling of the ground floor occurred in order to equalise the pressure on the walls from the mound . It is uncertain how many other towers or keeps have similar mounds , as excavation is usually required before the foundations can be examined , but Totnes and Farnham castles are known to have mottes build against the walls of the keep . The reason for building the mound is uncertain , but it was almost certainly not designed as a serious defensive feature . It was instead probably intended as to superficially imitate older motte and bailey designs , with the completed castle echoing these former symbols of power and reinforcing the current political status of its owner .",

In Massachusetts he was treated politely , but his attempts to implement the crown 's policies ran into trouble , as they had in New York . He was refused a salary by the colonial legislature , although the \" gift \" of £ 1 @,@ 000 he received was more than that typically given other governors of the province . The legislature also made repeated attempts to limit appeals to London of judicial decisions handed down by provincial courts .

He moved to Bournemouth to see his brother Gordon who was now a pilot officer in No. 501 Squadron RAF . At Queen Mary 's Hospital he was fitted with a new arm . MacLachlan explained to the doctors that he required an arm that would allow him to fly a Hurricane .

  "A period 1 element is one of the chemical elements in the first row ( or period ) of the periodic table of the chemical elements . The periodic table is laid out in rows to illustrate recurring ( periodic ) trends in the chemical behaviour of the elements as their atomic number increases : a new row is begun when chemical behaviour begins to repeat , meaning that elements with similar behaviour fall into the same vertical columns . The first period contains fewer elements than any other row in the table , with only two : hydrogen and helium . This situation can be explained by modern theories of atomic structure . In a quantum mechanical description of atomic structure , this period corresponds to the filling of the 1s orbital . Period 1 elements obey the duet rule in that they need two electrons to complete their valence shell . The maximum number of electrons that these elements can accommodate is two , both in the 1s orbital . Therefore , period 1 can have only two elements .",

He was asked to write \" a big bold romantic episode \" which would also serve as a \" sort of reboot episode \" and a good introduction to Doctor Who . Whithouse was asked to set it \" anywhere in the world \" that was romantic , and he chose Venice , which he called \" one of my favourite places in the world \" . Whithouse believed that the vampires fit into the setting . Whithouse had a positive experience writing the episode , reflecting that \" writing on the show is a delight and a pleasure \" . As he is executive producer of Being Human , he was pleased he only had to write the episode and not worry about the other aspects of production . The major plot point of \" sinking Venice \" was conceived as Whithouse needed to use the identity of the location and it was a very aquatic city , and Venice was \" constantly fighting \" enemies in its history but this time it proved to be its own worst enemy .",

  "The Quadruple Process Model involves a stimulus ( ex : Black male ) activating an association ( ex : threat ) in which the strength of the association ( stereotype ) prompts a behavior ( ex : shoot response ) . To survive , evolutionarily , humans must be to reliably identify threats . The stimulus , association , stereotype , behavior system prompts the identification of a threat and initiates a response to the stimulus . Threat relevant associates are emotionally saturate and essential for survival . Not only can threat perception be influenced by emotionally salient factors , cultural stereotypes , and their strength combine to disadvantage blacks to be perceived as more threatening . Recent stereotypes suggest that Blacks , even when unarmed , may be perceived as threatening . Shooter bias is a tendency to shoot armed Blacks quicker and more frequently than armed Whites , but deciding not to shoot unarmed Whites quicker and more frequently than unarmed Blacks . Individuals with greater knowledge of this cultural stereotype or a predisposition to link Blacks to violence displayed more extreme shooter bias and especially biased threat perceptions that led to especially biased behavior .",

  "The earliest breeding of the ancestors of the Cleveland Bay was done in large part by English churches and monasteries , to meet a need for pack horses to carry trade goods between abbeys and monasteries in northeast England . These medieval horses gained the nickname of \" Chapman Horses \" because of their use by travelling merchants known as \" chapmen \" . What is now the Cleveland Bay was developed from Barb and Andalusian horses crossed with Chapman Horse mares . The Barb blood came mainly from horses imported by wealthy young men on their Grand Tour of Europe , bought off the docks in Marseilles and transported back to England . The Andalusian blood came from horses bred at the royal stud in Cordoba and given to English royalty by the King of Spain . The stallions were often available for breeding to local horses , and the first infusion of Andalusian blood was added to the native Chapman Horses . The Spanish horses also made their way to the outlying estates of English nobility , and were then taken by Oliver Cromwell 's men after the English Civil War . Once in the hands of Cromwell 's men , many of the stallions were made available for locals to cross with the existing Chapman Horses , adding a second infusion of Andalusian bloodlines . In the late 17th century a second infusion of Barb blood was added when Cleveland breeders purchased horses directly from soldiers at Tangier or from the Moors themselves .",

  "The school is run as a democracy , with students deciding affairs that range from the curriculum to the behavior code . Lessons are non @-@ compulsory . Neill emphasizes \" self @-@ regulation \" , personal responsibility , freedom from fear , \" freedom in sex play \" , and loving understanding over moral instruction or force . In his philosophy , all attempts to mold children are coercive in nature and therefore harmful . Caretakers are advised to \" trust \" in the natural process and let children self @-@ regulate such that they live by their own rules and consequently treat with the highest respect the rights of others to live by their own rules . Neill 's \" self @-@ regulation \" constitutes a child 's right to \" live freely , without outside authority in things psychic and somatic \" — that children eat and come of age when they wants , are never hit , and are \" always loved and protected \" . Children can do as they please until their actions affect others . In an example , a student can skip French class to play music , but cannot disruptively play music during the French class . Against the popular image of \" go as you please schools \" , Summerhill has many rules . However , they are decided at a schoolwide meeting where students and teachers each have one vote apiece . This does not necessarily mean total cessation to the children , as Neill thought adults were right to bemoan child destruction of property . He considered this tension between adult and child living styles to be natural . Neill felt that most schoolwork and books kept children from their right to play , and that learning should only follow play and not be mixed \" to make [ work ] palatable \" . Neill found that those students interested in college would complete the prerequisites in two years and of their own volition .",

  "In many countries during the 1950s a large number of trained pilots wanted to continue flying . Many were also aeronautical engineers who could design , build and maintain gliders .

This stimulated the development of both gliding and gliders , for example the membership of the Soaring Society of America increased from 1 @,@ 000 to 16 @,@ 000 by 1980 . The increased numbers of pilots , greater knowledge and improving technology helped set new records , for example the pre @-@ war altitude record was doubled by 1950 , and the first 1 @,@ 000 @-@ kilometre ( 620 mi ) flight was achieved in 1964 . New materials such as glass fiber and carbon fiber , advances in wing shapes and airfoils , electronic instruments , the Global Positioning System and improved weather forecasting have since allowed many pilots to make flights that were once extraordinary . Today over 550 pilots have made flights over 1 @,@ 000 kilometres ( 620 mi ) . Although there is no Olympic competition , there are the World Gliding Championships .

  "Due to the extreme tidal range in the Bristol Channel , finding a suitable launching site for lifeboats proved an arduous task for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution ( RNLI ) . Davits were installed on the pier in 1882 , enabling a lifeboat to be lowered into the water below , even at low tide . A new , larger lifeboat was stationed here in 1889 and a boathouse was built for it on the north east side of the island with a 100 feet ( 30 m ) slipway beside the pier . This facility was replaced in 1902 when a new boathouse was built on the south east side of the island . This had a 368 feet ( 112 m ) slipway which enabled the lifeboat to be launched at most states of the tide and was the longest in England . The slipway was closed in 2007 due to its poor condition , since when the lifeboats have been launched from the north east side of the island .

  "Commercial solar water heaters began appearing in the United States in the 1890s . These systems saw increasing use until the 1920s but were gradually replaced by cheaper and more reliable heating fuels . As with photovoltaics , solar water heating attracted renewed attention as a result of the oil crises in the 1970s but interest subsided in the 1980s due to falling petroleum prices . Development in the solar water heating sector progressed steadily throughout the 1990s and annual growth rates have averaged 20 % since 1999 . Although generally underestimated , solar water heating and cooling is by far the most widely deployed solar technology with an estimated capacity of 154 GW as of 2007 .",

  "Naoki Hisaya , who wrote Ayu 's story , commented in an interview that the night before he was to present the beginning of a Kanon scenario , he suddenly remembered wanting to write for some time about a ghost girl who waits for the protagonist to come back to her . He said that he wanted to write this no matter what and quickly drew up an outline for the premise of Ayu 's scenario . At the time , Ayu 's premise was the start of the entire Kanon story , though it was still very vague . Eventually , Hisaya was able to form her story into the style of a romance visual novel , and in the process the characters in the story started to multiply . Hisaya said that Ayu was the one character in Kanon that he felt he grasped the best , but noted it was very difficult to write her character due to Ayu being primarily energetic . Hisaya said that he is much better at writing about quiet characters , so Ayu gave him a lot of trouble . Hisaya noted that Ayu 's frequent use of \" ugū \" was not decided from the beginning , and that it merely turned out that way during the natural writing process .",

  "Ecology studies the distribution and abundance of living organisms , and the interactions between organisms and their environment . The habitat of an organism can be described as the local abiotic factors such as climate and ecology , in addition to the other organisms and biotic factors that share its environment .

Lin Yu mentioned also that the ' fierce fire oil ' derived ultimately from one of China 's maritime contacts in the ' southern seas ' , Arabia ( Dashiguo ) . In the Battle of Langshan Jiang in 919 , the naval fleet of the Wenmu King from Wuyue defeated a Huainan army from the Wu state ; Wenmu 's success was facilitated by the use of ' fire oil ' ( ' huo you ' ) to burn their fleet , signifying the first Chinese use of gunpowder in a battle . The Chinese applied the use of double @-@ piston bellows to pump petrol out of a single cylinder ( with an upstroke and downstroke ) , lit at the end by a slow @-@ burning gunpowder match to fire a continuous stream of flame . This device was featured in description and illustration of the Wujing Zongyao military manuscript of 1044 . In the suppression of the Southern Tang state by 976 , early Song naval forces confronted them on the Yangtze River in 975 . Southern Tang forces attempted to use flamethrowers against the Song navy , but were accidentally consumed by their own fire when violent winds swept in their direction .",

  "In the last two decades , photovoltaics ( PV ) , also known as solar PV , has evolved from a pure niche market of small scale applications towards becoming a mainstream electricity source . A solar cell is a device that converts light directly into electricity using the photoelectric effect . The first solar cell was constructed by Charles Fritts in the 1880s . In 1931 a German engineer , Dr Bruno Lange , developed a photo cell using silver selenide in place of copper oxide . Although the prototype selenium cells converted less than 1 % of incident light into electricity , both Ernst Werner von Siemens and James Clerk Maxwell recognized the importance of this discovery . Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s , researchers Gerald Pearson , Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the crystalline silicon solar cell in 1954 .

A core group of three persons , all withdrawn , Epicurean and decadent figures , allow the intrusion of Gore Pirgu , a low @-@ class and uncultured self @-@ seeker , whose character comes to embody the new political class of Greater Romania . Researcher Constantin Amăriuței proposed that there is an intrinsic connection between Pirgu and Mitică , a voluble clerk depicted in several sketch stories by Ion Luca Caragiale , and best remembered as a stereotype of Bucharesters ; according to Amăriuței , Pirgu is \" the eternal and real Mitică of the Romanian world \" . According to Matei Călinescu , the story is intertextually shaped by two of Ion Luca 's prose works : one of them , titled Inspecțiune ... ( \" Inspection ... \" ) , is part of the Mitică cycle , while the other , Grand Hotel \" Victoria română \" , is one of the earliest depictions of anxiety in the literature of Romania . For Matei Călinescu , Pirgu and the other protagonists stand as allegories for a set of essentially Romanian traits that , he argues , were still observable in the early 21st century .",

  "Jainism speaks of karmic \" dirt \" , as karma is thought to be manifest as very subtle and microscopically imperceptible particles pervading the entire universe . They are so small that one space @-@ point — the smallest possible extent of space — contains an infinite number of karmic particles ( or quantity of karmic dirt ) . It is these karmic particles that adhere to the soul and affect its natural potency . This material karma is called dravya karma ; and the resultant emotions — pleasure , pain , love , hatred , and so on — experienced by the soul are called bhava karma , psychic karma . The relationship between the material and psychic karma is that of cause and effect . The material karma gives rise to the feelings and emotions in worldly souls , which — in turn — give rise to psychic karma , causing emotional modifications within the soul . These emotions , yet again , result in influx and bondage of fresh material karma . Jains hold that the karmic matter is actually an agent that enables the consciousness to act within the material context of this universe . They are the material carrier of a soul 's desire to physically experience this world . When attracted to the consciousness , they are stored in an interactive karmic field called kārmaṇa śarīra , which emanates from the soul . Thus , karma is a subtle matter surrounding the consciousness of a soul . When these two components — consciousness and ripened karma — interact , the soul experiences life as known in the present material universe .",

In 1922 , the Communist Party of Guatemala was created , and became a significant influence among urban laborers ; however , it had little reach among the rural and Indian populations .

Fearing the possibility of a revolution , the landed elite lent their support to Jorge Ubico y Castañeda , who had built a reputation for ruthlessness and efficiency as a provincial governor . Ubico won the election that followed in 1931 , in which he was the only candidate .",

  "The historian Barbara Yorke says of Wilfrid at this time that he \" seems to have continued a campaign against any survival of ' Irish errors ' and distrusted any communities that remained in contact with Iona or other Irish religious houses which did not follow the Roman Easter \" . He also worked to combat pagan practices , building a church at Melrose on a pagan site . Contemporaries said of him that he was the first native bishop to \" introduce the Catholic way of life to the churches of the English \" . He did not neglect his pastoral duties in his diocese , making visits throughout the diocese to baptise and perform other episcopal functions , such as consecrating new churches . Some of the monasteries in his diocese were put under his protection by their abbots or abbesses , who were seeking someone to help protect their endowments . In ruling over such monasteries , Wilfrid may have been influenced by the Irish model of a group of monasteries all ruled by one person , sometimes while holding episcopal office .",
  "The current alignment of PA 652 was classified as a state highway as early as 1920 , nine years after the Sproul Road Bill was passed by the Pennsylvania State Legislature .

Signs were changed by April of that year .",
  "Stone and Ream 's model received the most praise . Stone 's model was praised by several naval officers who called it \" true to life \" and \" unsurpassed by similar works . \" Ream 's model received praise from several high profile individuals , most notably President Ulysses S. Grant , who called it \" first rate \" . Admiral David Dixon Porter said the model \" of Miss Vinnie Ream is the only likeness in the lot . \" General William Tecumseh Sherman , who was reportedly infatuated with Ream , also became a strong advocate for her model . He wrote to the committee that \" the plaster model of Vinnie Ream struck me decidedly as the best likeness , and recalled the memory of the Admiral 's face and figure more perfectly than any other model there on exhibition . \" The decision by the committee ultimately ended in a three @-@ way tie between Ream , Stone , and MacDonald . The project stalled until the next Congress convened in 1874 . A commission to select the winning model was created and consisted of Virginia , Sherman , and Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson . Virginia and Sherman voted to approve Ream 's design , though Robeson refused to accept the result and tried in vain to convince Virginia to change her mind . Two months after the vote , Robeson relented and Ream 's model was officially selected .",
  "Although the astronomical armillary sphere ( representing the celestial sphere ) existed in China since the 1st century BCE , the mathematician and court astronomer Zhang Heng ( 78 – 139 CE ) provided it with motive power by using the constant pressure head of an inflow water clock to rotate a waterwheel that acted on a set of gears . Zhang Heng was also the first to address the problem of the falling pressure head in the inflow water clock ( which gradually slowed the timekeeping ) by setting up an additional tank between the reservoir and inflow vessel .",

  "On July 14 , 1931 , Assistant Mint Director Mary Margaret O 'Reilly wrote to Moore , asking the Commission 's advice on a design competition for the new quarter . Moore replied , stating that as Fraser had won the competition for the medal , she should adapt her design for the quarter . Secretary Mellon responded to Moore , stating that as the Treasury had been no party to the earlier design agreement , it was not bound by it , and would not follow it . The Treasury proceeded to hold a design competition , and when the Fine Arts Commission met to consider the submitted designs in an advisory role , it selected those submitted by Fraser . The designs were submitted to Mellon in November 1931 ; he selected Flanagan 's design and notified Moore of the decision . Moore and commission member Adolph Weinman ( who had designed the Mercury dime and Walking Liberty half dollar ) attempted to get Mellon to change his mind , but only got him to agree to allow the various sculptors more time to improve their entries — they had asked for more time just for Fraser . On January 20 , 1932 , following resubmissions , the commission affirmed its support of the Fraser designs .",

Whatever the role of alcohol , it was clear that shipboard routine was breaking down ; as Tyson remarked , \" There is so little regularity observed .
