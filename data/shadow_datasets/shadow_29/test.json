  "Thomas Charles @-@ Edwards has suggested that the kingdom of Dál Riata was a cross @-@ roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland , with which the Scots settlers in what is now Argyll kept close contacts . This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd , which combine Pictish and Irish elements . This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the Hunterston brooch , found in Ayrshire , which may have been made in Dál Riata , but with elements that suggest Irish origins . These and other finds , including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration ( or pressblech ) , perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn , indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed . In the eighth and ninth centuries the Pictish elite adopted true penannular brooches with lobed terminals from Ireland .

  "Mahler 's Hamburg post was as chief conductor , subordinate to the director , Bernhard Pohl ( known as Pollini ) who retained overall artistic control . Pollini was prepared to give Mahler considerable leeway if the conductor could provide commercial as well as artistic success . This Mahler did in his first season , when he conducted Wagner 's Tristan und Isolde for the first time and gave acclaimed performances of the same composer 's Tannhäuser and Siegfried . Another triumph was the German premiere of Tchaikovsky 's Eugene Onegin , in the presence of the composer , who called Mahler 's conducting \" astounding \" , and later asserted in a letter that he believed Mahler was \" positively a genius \" . Mahler 's demanding rehearsal schedules led to predictable resentment from the singers and orchestra with whom , according to music writer Peter Franklin , the conductor \" inspired hatred and respect in almost equal measure . \" He found support , however , from Hans von Bülow , who was in Hamburg as director of the city 's subscription concerts .

Recommend you come right immediately ! \" , but this message was relayed by \" talkers \" ( men charged with relaying messages for officers to different stations ) and the talker who was supposed to pass Peckham 's message to Brown had a tendency to mumble badly . At the same time Peckham was attempting to alert Brown of the impending grounding , Morris again approached Brown and recommended coming right to avoid the shoal water . Captain Brown did not recall being informed of this , and made no reply to Morris . At this point Morris took a bearing on Thimble Shoals , and alarmed at the impending grounding Morris frantically returned to the captain waving his arms and shouting \" Come right ! There 's shoal water ahead ! \" A disbelieving Captain Brown dismissed Morris pleas by stating that it was his belief that the navigator did not know where they were . To verify Morris ' claims of impending shoal water , Brown asked Commander Millet to check Morris 's position . As a precautionary move , Brown then ordered Quartermaster Travis , Missouri 's helmsman , to alter course to 058 , but this order came too late .",

  "Sigma Phi Epsilon ( \" Sig Ep \" ) at Dartmouth College was founded on April 22 , 1908 , as the local fraternity Omicron Pi Sigma . In 1909 , the local fraternity became New Hampshire Alpha Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon . By the late 1960s , the house had become disenchanted with the national organization and felt that the Dartmouth membership would be better served as a local fraternity . The brothers voted to dissociate from the national organization on January 18 , 1967 . A vote of the alumni of the New Hampshire Alpha chapter on February 1 , 1967 , supported the decision . The new local fraternity adopted the name Sigma Theta Epsilon ( which was also used by an unrelated national fraternity ) . The Sigma Phi Epsilon national continued to communicate with the local Sigma Theta Epsilon fraternity at Dartmouth , and by 1981 was willing to offer significant financial support for building renovations in exchange for reaffiliation . Convinced that the national organization had reformed in its commitment to the individual chapters , the local fraternity voted to rejoin Sigma Phi Epsilon on February 18 , 1981 . The national Sigma Phi Epsilon organization is known for its Balanced Man Program , an ongoing program of development through which members challenge themselves and to use their different talents and backgrounds to help each other become balanced men ( having a Sound Mind in a Sound Body ) and balanced servant leaders for the world 's communities . Members of Sigma Phi Epsilon become members the moment they join the fraternity , without having to endure a traditional pledge period . However , they commit to taking on a series of personal and leadership development challenges for the rest of their time as an undergraduate . The New Hampshire Alpha Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon was actually the first chapter to adopt the Balanced Man Program . Prominent alumni of the New Hampshire Alpha chapter include Theodor S.

  "After a tank is cleaned , provided that it is going to be prepared for entry , it will be purged . Purging is accomplished by pumping inert gas into the tank until hydrocarbons have been sufficiently expelled .

  "Once a droplet has frozen , it grows in the supersaturated environment , which is one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point . The droplet then grows by deposition of water molecules in the air ( vapor ) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected . Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance , the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets . This process is known as the Wegener – Bergeron – Findeisen process . The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the droplets to evaporate , meaning that the ice crystals grow at the droplets ' expense . These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation , since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass , and may collide and stick together in clusters , or aggregates . These aggregates are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground . Guinness World Records list the world 's largest ( aggregate ) snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh , Montana ; allegedly one measured 15 inches ( 38 cm ) wide . Although this report by a farmer is doubtful , aggregates of three or four inches width have been observed . Single crystals the size of a dime ( 17 @.@ 91 mm in diameter ) have been observed .",

The school board insisted on seeing the script and immediately objected to the violence against teenage children and the cynical , dark dialogue , including that of the fictional school principal . Local newspapers criticized the project , and irate parents objected to such a film taking place at their children 's school . Comparisons were made between film violence and the kidnap and murder of Polly Klaas three years prior , which had left the area sensitized toward violence . The producers received support from the school 's students and some local residents , who recognized that economic benefits would be generated by the film 's presence .

Given the strong medieval trade connections between south @-@ east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy , the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch krick ( -e ) , meaning a stick ; or the Olde English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff .

Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel , meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church , the shape of which resembled the two stump wicket used in early cricket .

A psychodrama therapy group , under the direction of a licensed psychodramatist , reenacts real @-@ life , past situations ( or inner mental processes ) , acting them out in present time . Participants then have the opportunity to evaluate their behavior , reflect on how the past incident is getting played out in the present and more deeply understand particular situations in their lives . Psychodrama offers a creative way for an individual or group to explore and solve personal problems . It may be used in a variety of clinical and community @-@ based settings , and is most often utilized in a group setting , in which the members of the group serve as therapeutic agents for one another in the enacted drama . Psychodrama is not , however , a form of group therapy , and is instead an individual psychotherapy that is executed from within a group . There are \" side @-@ benefits \" that the other group members may experience , as they make relevant connections and insights to their own lives from the psychodrama of another . A psychodrama is best conducted and produced by a person trained in the method , called a psychodrama director .",

  "Although the main characters were designed by Fujisaka , the character Legna , previously known as the \" Black Dragon \" , was designed by Taro Hasegawa , who was also monster designer for both Drakengard and Drakengard 2 . In addition to designing the characters , Fujisaka drew the character portraits used for character dialogue boxes during in @-@ game cutscenes , a feature he initially objected to . Nowe , in contrast to the other protagonists of the Drakengard series , was designed around the concept of a stereotypical hero . Nowe was one of Fujisaka 's favorite characters to design , although Shiba was less enthusiastic . Manah 's redesign in Drakengard 2 reflected both her evolved personality and her more traditional depiction as a fantasy heroine . Elements of their designs were taken from Caim and Furiae , representing \" passing the torch \" between characters . Because of Legna 's different roles in Drakengard and Drakengard 2 , his design and movements were altered for his second incarnation . Eris 's design was inspired by Casca , a character from Berserk : while he tried not to copy any parts of Casca 's design , Fujisaka tried to convey it using aspects of her personality . He also tried to balance this part of her depiction with a tender and more feminine side . Another idea he had in mind was the image of an honors student . Her dance @-@ like fighting style was generally suggested by the game 's staff . Caim 's redesign was meant to represent his status as a wanderer .",

It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe , sites built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture . The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain . Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and , as a result , trading patterns shifted .

Tropical storms and nor 'easters are common occurrences along the Atlantic coast of Florida ; the St. Johns River lies between 10 and 30 miles ( 16 and 48 km ) inland , so any storm striking the counties of Indian River north to Duval produces rain that is drained by the St. Johns River . Tropical Storm Fay in 2008 deposited 16 inches ( 410 mm ) of rain in a 5 @-@ day period , most of it located near Melbourne . The St. Johns near Geneva in Seminole County rose 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) in four days , setting a record . The river near Sanford rose 3 feet ( 1 m ) in 36 hours . Fay caused severe flooding in the middle basin due not only to the deluge but the flat slopes of the river . Typically , however , the St. Johns basin receives between 50 and 54 inches ( 1 @,@ 300 and 1 @,@ 400 mm ) of rain annually , half of it in summer months . The rate of evapotranspiration corresponds to rainfall , ranging between 27 and 57 inches ( 690 and 1 @,@ 450 mm ) a year , most of it occurring in the summer .",

  "The lower the values of ionization energy , electronegativity and electron affinity , the more metallic character the element has . Conversely , nonmetallic character increases with higher values of these properties . Given the periodic trends of these three properties , metallic character tends to decrease going across a period ( or row ) and , with some irregularities ( mostly ) due to poor screening of the nucleus by d and f electrons , and relativistic effects , tends to increase going down a group ( or column or family ) . Thus , the most metallic elements ( such as caesium and francium ) are found at the bottom left of traditional periodic tables and the most nonmetallic elements ( oxygen , fluorine , chlorine ) at the top right . The combination of horizontal and vertical trends in metallic character explains the stair @-@ shaped dividing line between metals and nonmetals found on some periodic tables , and the practice of sometimes categorizing several elements adjacent to that line , or elements adjacent to those elements , as metalloids .",

This early theory has since been rejected , however , because \" Faustinus \" was historically a common name , and it only occurs on a single spoon in the hoard . Furthermore , the logic of using inscriptions on individual items in the hoard to determine ownership of the hoard as a whole is considered flawed . Based on the dating of the coins in the hoard , the majority of which belong to the period 394 – 405 , it also has been speculated that the contents of the hoard originally belonged to a military family that accompanied Count Theodosius to Britain in 368 – 369 , and which may have left with Constantine III in 407 .",

  "The basic technique for GMAW is quite simple , since the electrode is fed automatically through the torch ( head of tip ) . By contrast , in gas tungsten arc welding , the welder must handle a welding torch in one hand and a separate filler wire in the other , and in shielded metal arc welding , the operator must frequently chip off slag and change welding electrodes . GMAW requires only that the operator guide the welding gun with proper position and orientation along the area being welded . Keeping a consistent contact tip @-@ to @-@ work distance ( the stick out distance ) is important , because a long stickout distance can cause the electrode to overheat and also wastes shielding gas . Stickout distance varies for different GMAW weld processes and applications . The orientation of the gun is also important — it should be held so as to bisect the angle between the workpieces ; that is , at 45 degrees for a fillet weld and 90 degrees for welding a flat surface . The travel angle , or lead angle , is the angle of the torch with respect to the direction of travel , and it should generally remain approximately vertical . However , the desirable angle changes somewhat depending on the type of shielding gas used — with pure inert gases , the bottom of the torch is often slightly in front of the upper section , while the opposite is true when the welding atmosphere is carbon dioxide .",

  "Weber was also influenced by Kantian ethics , which he nonetheless came to think of as obsolete in a modern age lacking in religious certainties . In this last respect , the influence of Friedrich Nietzsche 's philosophy is evident . According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy , the \" deep tension between the Kantian moral imperatives and a Nietzschean diagnosis of the modern cultural world is apparently what gives such a darkly tragic and agnostic shade to Weber 's ethical worldview \" . Another major influence in Weber 's life was the writings of Karl Marx and the workings of socialist thought in academia and active politics . While Weber shares some of Marx 's consternation with bureaucratic systems and maligns them as being capable of advancing their own logic to the detriment of human freedom and autonomy , Weber views conflict as perpetual and inevitable and does not host the spirit of a materially available utopia . Though the influence of his mother 's Calvinist religiosity is evident throughout Weber 's life and work , and though he maintained a deep , lifelong interest in the study of religions , Weber was open about the fact that he was personally irreligious .",

  "J. B. Haggin , an American breeder and owner of the historic Elmendorf Farm , had begun to ship large contingents of horses to England for sale , including the 1908 Grand National steeplechase winner Rubio , and the fear was that if other American breeders followed his lead , the English racing market would be overwhelmed . As a first step , the English racing authorities began to limit the number of training licences at Newmarket Racecourse , turning away a number of American breeders . The General Stud Book rules for registration were also amended in 1909 to restrict registration to horses whose ancestry entirely traced to horses already registered in the General Stud Book , but horses registered in other national stud books were still allowed to be imported and registered .",

  "McCarthy and President Truman clashed often during the years both held office . McCarthy characterized Truman and the Democratic Party as soft on , or even in league with , Communists , and spoke of the Democrats ' \" twenty years of treason \" . Truman , in turn , once referred to McCarthy as \" the best asset the Kremlin has \" , calling McCarthy 's actions an attempt to \" sabotage the foreign policy of the United States \" in a cold war and comparing it to shooting American soldiers in the back in a hot war . It was the Truman Administration 's State Department that McCarthy accused of harboring 205 ( or 57 or 81 ) \" known Communists \" . Truman 's Secretary of Defense , George Catlett Marshall , was the target of some of McCarthy 's most vitriolic rhetoric . Marshall had been Army Chief of Staff during World War II and was also Truman 's former Secretary of State . Marshall was a highly respected General and statesman , remembered today as the architect of victory and peace , the latter based on the Marshall Plan for post @-@ war reconstruction of Europe , for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 . McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall , later published in 1951 as a book titled America 's Retreat From Victory : The Story of George Catlett Marshall . Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China , and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the loss of China to Communism . In the speech McCarthy also implied that Marshall was guilty of treason ; declared that \" if Marshall were merely stupid , the laws of probability would dictate that part of his decisions would serve this country 's interest \" ; and most famously , accused him of being part of \" a conspiracy so immense and an infamy so black as to dwarf any previous venture in the history of man \" .",

Over Roskilde , Denmark , he caught a Ju 88 after a 10 @-@ minute chase and shot it down — his 28th victory . On 12 May Braham repeated the operation . This time he took Bill Gregory with him . Operating over the Aalborg – Copenhagen line he spotted a Fw 190 near Hurning . Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109 — his presence clearly detected by German radar . His Mosquito was hit in the port wing and the fuel line were ruptured . The Bf 109 then disappeared . Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190 . At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames , stalled and crashed near Aalborg . The range was so close — around 100 yards — the Focke @-@ Wulf nearly collided with Braham . The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground , meant that the chances of reaching England were slim . He climbed to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received . He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half .

  "In the winter of 1896 – 97 , William T. Brooke of London discovered some anonymous manuscripts in a \" barrow of books about to be trashed \" or a \" street bookstall \" . Brooke thought that they might be lost works by Henry Vaughan and showed them to Alexander Grosart ( 1827 – 99 ) , a Scottish clergyman and expert on Elizabethan and Jacobean literature who reprinted rare works . Grosart agreed that the manuscripts were by Vaughan and planned to include them in an edition of Vaughan 's works that he was preparing for publication . Grosart died in 1899 and the proposed edition was never completed . Grosart 's collection , including the manuscripts , was purchased by Charles Higham , a London bookseller , who asked his friend Bertram Dobell ( 1842 – 1914 ) to examine them . Dobell was convinced that they were not by Vaughan and soon discovered that they were by Traherne . The manuscripts , which included poetry as well as a collection of contemplative paragraphs \" embodying reflexions on religion and morals \" , were published as Centuries of Meditations .",

  "The Cabinet War Rooms is an underground complex that served as a British government command centre throughout the Second World War .

  "Monitor was soon in trouble as the storm increased in ferocity . Large waves were splashing over and completely covering the deck and pilot house so the crew temporarily rigged the wheel atop the turret which was manned by Helmsman Francis Butts .

In this way new combinations of genes can occur in the offspring of a mating pair . Genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never recombine . However , they do via the cellular process of chromosomal crossover . During crossover , chromosomes exchange stretches of DNA , effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes . This process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis , a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells .",

Two thousand refugees from Saint @-@ Domingue had recently arrived in the city in flight from the Haitian Revolution . They represented five percent of the city 's total population .

It includes the hit singles \" My Sweet Lord \" and \" What Is Life \" , as well as songs such as \" Isn 't It a Pity \" and the title track that were turned down by the Beatles .

They varied in size from the very large , such as the Bass of Inverurie , to more modest designs like Balmaclellan . In England many of these constructions were converted into stone \" keep @-@ and @-@ bailey \" castles in the twelfth century , but in Scotland most of those that were in continued occupation became stone castles of \" enceinte \" from the thirteenth century , with a high embattled curtain wall . The need for thick and high walls for defence forced the use of economic building methods , often continuing the Scottish tradition of dry @-@ stone rubble building , which were then covered with a lime render , or harled for weatherproofing and a uniform appearance . In addition to the baronial castles there were royal castles , often larger and providing defence , lodging for the itinerant Scottish court and a local administrative centre . By 1200 these included fortifications at Ayr and Berwick . In Scotland Alexander II ( r . 1198 – 1249 ) and Alexander III ( 1241 – 86 ) undertook a number of castle building projects in the modern style . Alexander III 's early death sparked conflict in Scotland and English intervention under Edward I in 1296 . The resulting Wars of Independence brought this phase of castle building to an end and began a new phase of siege warfare .",

  "In coordination with the Chinese assaults against Seoul in the western sector of the Third Phase Campaign , the North Koreans deployed the KPA II , III and V Corps — an estimated total of 61 @,@ 500 soldiers — against the UN forces on the central front . The North Korean plan was a frontal attack at Wonju by Major General Pang Ho San 's KPA V Corps , while Major General Ch 'oe Hyon 's KPA II Corps would infiltrate the US X Corps rear as guerrillas and block Route 29 . The aim of the offensive was to push the US X Corps back in concert with the Chinese attacks on Seoul , thereby isolating the South Korean forces in the Taebaek Mountains . As part of the Chinese attacks against Seoul , the Chinese 42nd and 66th Corps were deployed near Chuncheon in support of the KPA V Corps during the opening phase of the battle . Meanwhile , the KPA III Corps would act as reinforcements for the KPA II and V Corps .

  "As the place where English first evolved , the British Isles , and particularly England , are home to the most variegated pattern of dialects . Within the United Kingdom , the Received Pronunciation ( RP ) , an educated dialect of South East England , is traditionally used as the broadcast standard , and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects . The spread of RP ( also known as BBC English ) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede , as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects . At the time of the Survey of English Dialects , grammar and vocabulary differed across the country , but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear . Nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary , and in fact only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP , the remainder speaking regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence . There is also variability within RP , particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life . Within Britain there is also considerable variation along lines of social class , and some traits though exceedingly common are considered \" non @-@ standard \" and are associated with lower class speakers and identities . An example of this is H @-@ dropping , which was historically a feature of lower class London English , particularly Cockney , but which today is the standard in all major English cities — yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society .",

  "Cyathus striatus , commonly known as the fluted bird 's nest , is a common saprobic bird 's nest fungus with a widespread distribution throughout temperate regions of the world .

C. striatus can be distinguished from most other bird 's nest fungi by its hairy exterior and grooved ( striated ) inner walls .

The color and size of this species can vary somewhat , but they are typically less than a centimeter wide and tall , and grey or brown in color . Another common name given to C. striatus , splash cups , alludes to the method of spore dispersal : the sides of the cup are angled such that falling drops of water can dislodge the peridioles and eject them from the cup . The specific epithet is derived from the Latin stria , meaning \" with fine ridges or grooves \" .",

On the road the travelers encounter Hardcastle 's stepson , Tony Lumpkin , who in revenge for punishment his stepfather has inflicted , directs Marlow and his friend to the Hardcastle mansion , claiming that it is an inn where they will be well treated . In the meantime , great preparations are being made at the Hardcastle home for the reception of Hardcastle 's old friend , and when Tony ushers in young Marlow , thinking Hardcastle merely the proprietor of an inn , he treats him with scant courtesy and orders him about , much to the older man 's chagrin . Hardcastle is subjected to his daughter 's extravagant costumes , and she appears on this memorable evening dressed in a simple dress and wearing the cap and apron that housewives in the neighborhood assume . This costume greatly pleases her father , but leads young Marlow further astray . He immediately jumps to the conclusion that she is a most attractive barmaid and loses his heart to her in short order . Upon the arrival of his father , Marlow learns his mistake as regards the inn question , but flatly refuses to marry Hardcastle 's daughter , claiming that she is too grand for him , and citing his preference for the maid servant . While in the act of making love to the supposed barmaid he is discovered by his father , and , when told that this is the young lady his father had intended him to marry , he is overjoyed , as he feels sure that his bashful disposition would never have allowed him to woo and win her had he known her to be a lady of fashion . \"",

  "This shark 's behavior and social structure is not well understood . In South Africa , white sharks have a dominance hierarchy depending on the size , sex and squatter 's rights : Females dominate males , larger sharks dominate smaller sharks , and residents dominate newcomers . When hunting , great whites tend to separate and resolve conflicts with rituals and displays . White sharks rarely resort to combat although some individuals have been found with bite marks that match those of other white sharks . This suggests that when a great white approaches too closely to another , they react with a warning bite . Another possibility is that white sharks bite to show their dominance .",

  "Jeremy Krikler has argued that Mansfield wanted to ensure that commercial law remained as helpful to Britain 's overseas trade as possible and as a consequence was keen to uphold the principle of \" general average \" , even in relation to the killing of humans . This principle holds that a captain who jettisons part of his cargo in order to save the rest can claim for the loss from his insurers . For Mansfield to have found in favour of the insurers would have greatly undermined this idea . The revelation that rain had fallen during the period of the killings enabled Mansfield to order a retrial , while leaving the notion of \" general average \" intact . He emphasised that the massacre would have been legally justified and the owners ' insurance claim would have been valid , if the water shortage had not arisen from mistakes made by the captain .",

  "Different theories have been proposed to explain the designs of Indian and Pakistani leaders in this period .

  "In early 1997 , after months of negotiations , the San Diego Padres signed a working agreement with the Chiba Lotte Marines that gave the Padres exclusive signing rights to another Nomura client , Hideki Irabu . Although both Irabu and Nomura stated that Irabu would only sign with the New York Yankees , neither the Padres nor the Marines consulted Irabu before finalizing their deal . The Major League Baseball Players Association ( MLBPA ) sided with Irabu , stating that the arrangement unfairly disregarded a player 's expressed wishes . However , MLB 's executive council ruled that the Padres had not violated any existing rule , and therefore legally held the rights to Irabu . Following this decision , Irabu contemplated a number of different options , including playing in NPB until he became a free agent , and taking the matter to the U.S. judicial system .

  "The warfare with the Prussians relied on guerilla raids in the border regions . Small groups of men , a dozen to a hundred , made quick raids on farms , villages , border posts , etc . This was a positional warfare where neither side could defeat the other , but the Teutonic Knights relied on future reinforcements from Germany and Europe , while Prussians were draining their local resources . After the massacre of surrendered Teutonic soldiers in the Battle of Krücken in 1249 , the Knights refused to negotiate with the Prussians . The Prussians were also unable to coordinate their efforts and develop a common strategy : while each clan had its own leader , there was no one to lead all the clans .

  "From 1995 through early 1996 , Bell authored an essay entitled \" Assassination Politics \" in which he described the idea of using digital signatures through email to create an assassination market , \" predicting \" the deaths of government employees . Bell also speculated that some people could use these net @-@ based markets quite openly without encryption ( Part 10 of the essay ) . So there were two ways theorized to operate the scheme , one complex and secure and the other more open and potentially insecure . In effect , the arrangement would create an incentive for people to assassinate corrupt government officials , offering a reward that could be claimed by someone willing to submit an entry predicting a given person 's death at a particular time . If that person died at about that time , the correct bettor would win the pool money . Bell published his idea in a 10 @-@ part essay titled \" Assassination Politics \" on the alt.anarchism USENET newsgroup . Described by Wired as \" an unholy mix of encryption , anonymity , and digital cash to bring about the ultimate annihilation of all forms of government \" , the essay was nominated for a Chrysler Award for Innovation in Design in 1998 as \" an imaginative and sophisticated prospective for improving governmental accountability \" . Although the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that advocating violence against government officials is , in the absence of an \" incitement to imminent lawless action \" , protected by the First Amendment , the publication of \" Assassination Politics \" put Bell under the scrutiny of federal investigators in 1995 . The Cypherpunks list archives includes many references to , what became known as ' AP ' and ' APster ' from 1996 onwards . The name 's ' assassination politics ' and ' Jim Bell ' also cropped up in the US governments pursuit and prosecution of Carl Johnson ( The CJ Files ) . In 2001 , an Australian anarchist claimed to be acting on the ' Part 10 ' part of Assassination politics . This was covered by Declan McCullagh in Wired 's story titled \" Online Cincy Cop Threats Probed \" . Later , in 2003 , The Denver Post published a similar story titled \" Online threats target Denver investigators - Anarchist says e @-@ mails harmless ; feds disagree \" . This story was written by Jim Hughes . The essay attracted interest from theorists long before and after its author 's legal entanglements ; libertarian economist Bob Murphy criticised the assassination politics scheme in a pair of articles titled \" The Politics of Destruction \" in 2002 . Murphy claimed that assassination politics was both technically infeasible and ideologically undesirable – from an anarcho @-@ capitalist perspective ( crypto @-@ anarchism being a form of anarcho @-@ capitalism ) . Others , such as R. Sukumaran , argue that assassination markets as suggested by Bell are perhaps technically feasible , but because they are so revolutionary , they \" threaten elites \" and will be made illegal . However , Sukumaran argues that AP was revived within DARPA by Poindexter with FutureMAP , an attempt to \" extrapolate the Iowa Presidential markets system to the prediction of terroristic events \" under the \" interest of national security . \" Mike Huben has argued that were Assassination Politics ever to be accepted then governments would merely operate secretly ( critiques of libertarianism ) . Almost all commentary so far has focused on the first nine parts of the essay and there is little on part 10 .",

  "In 2005 , Resident Evil 4 attempted to redefine the genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming , broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action genre . Its ambitions paid off , earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005 , and the top rank on IGN 's Readers ' Picks Top 99 Games list . However , this also led some reviewers to suggest that the Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre , by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established . Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action , such as Silent Hill Homecoming , and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark . These changes were part of an overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay . These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games . Jim Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface , thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat . Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics , which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror .",

The assessment also includes a mental state examination , which is an assessment of the person 's current mood and thought content , in particular the presence of themes of hopelessness or pessimism , self @-@ harm or suicide , and an absence of positive thoughts or plans . Specialist mental health services are rare in rural areas , and thus diagnosis and management is left largely to primary @-@ care clinicians . This issue is even more marked in developing countries . The mental health examination may include the use of a rating scale such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression or the Beck Depression Inventory or the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire @-@ Revised . The score on a rating scale alone is insufficient to diagnose depression to the satisfaction of the DSM or ICD , but it provides an indication of the severity of symptoms for a time period , so a person who scores above a given cut @-@ off point can be more thoroughly evaluated for a depressive disorder diagnosis . Several rating scales are used for this purpose .",

The commanding officer of Fighter Squadron , Squadron Leader Johnny Summers , considered that it gave personnel \" most useful experience in the handling and maintenance of their aircraft under adverse conditions \" . One of No. 1 FTS 's leading instructors during the early 1930s , Flight Lieutenant Frederick Scherger , was also a flight commander in Fighter Squadron . In October 1931 , during a flight to Adelaide to take part in an aero club pageant , Scherger had to land at Nhill , Victoria , in strong winds ; his Bulldog finished up on its nose but the damage was slight , allowing him to complete the journey and win his air race with a top speed of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) .",

This writing project may have been a reaction to Waugh 's immediate circumstances ; he was in the last weeks of his Oxford career , contemplating failure in his examinations and irritated by the fact that most of his contemporaries appeared to be on the verge of brilliant careers . On 22 June 1924 he spent time working out the plot , a continuation of the supernatural theme explored in \" Unacademic Exercise \" . The basic premise was an undergraduate inheriting a country house of which nothing was left except an 18th @-@ century folly , where he set up house and practised black magic .",
  "Towards the end of the ninth century , due to the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire the Catholic Church had to rely upon powerful European nobles for support . Pope Stephen V approached Arnulf of Carinthia to protect Rome from \" pagan and evil Christians \" . After he refused , Stephen V had to rely upon Guy III of Spoleto instead . Guy agreed to protect Rome as long as he was named as the Holy Roman Emperor , to which Stephen V acceded . After Stephen V 's death , Pope Formosus was elected . Formosus and Guy were reluctant allies , and Guy forced Formosus to crown him emperor again and to name his son , Lambert , as co @-@ emperor and successor . Formosus did so , but after Guy 's death , he lobbied Arnulf to rescue Rome from the Spoletans . Arnulf agreed , and Formosus subsequently appointed him as the Holy Roman Emperor in 894 . Both Arnulf and Formosus died within a few years of the coronation , and the new pope , Stephen VI , crowned Lambert as the new emperor shortly thereafter .",

  "The puffins are energetic burrow @-@ engineers and repairers and the grassy slopes may be undermined by a network of tunnels . This causes the turf to dry out in summer , vegetation to die and dry soil be whirled away by the wind .

A colony on Grassholm was lost through erosion when there was so little soil left that burrows could not be made . New colonies are very unlikely to start up spontaneously because this gregarious bird will only nest where others are already present . Nevertheless , the Audubon Society had success on Eastern Egg Rock Island in Maine , where , after a gap of ninety years , puffins were reintroduced and started breeding again .

  "An amendment to the Government of India 's Environment Impact Assessment Notification of 1994 was made in 2004 , which required that environmental clearance be granted to any parcel of land that falls under the Yamuna floodplain before beginning any construction activities . Since Akshardham commenced construction activities in 2000 , prior to the enactment of this amendment , it did not apply to Akshardham . However certain NGOs and activists felt that the temple was constructed without obtaining the necessary environmental clearances . On January 2005 , the U.P. Employees Federation presented their case before the Supreme Court of India that the temple had not obtained necessary environmental clearances and that it would be harmful to the environment . After hearing the case , the Supreme Court observed that in the construction of Akshardham , all the Land Use Plans had been adhered to and clearance of expert bodies like the Central Water Commission and the National Environment Engineering Research Institute has been obtained . Thus , the Supreme Court ruled that the Akshardham construction was lawful and did not violate environmental norms . Despite this ruling , some activists and politicians continued to assert that the Akshardham construction was illegal and posed a threat to the Yamuna River floodplains . In a 2009 ruling on a related issue , the Supreme Court further clarified that it rejected as false the assertions that Akshardham did not have environmental permissions and was harmful to the Yamuna riverbed . It reiterated its earlier 2005 Ruling that Akshardham had received all necessary environmental permissions from Central Water Commission and NEERI , which is an autonomous body , and that the Akshardham site was not located on the Yamuna “ riverbed ” or “ floodplain ” , but 1700 meters away from the Yamuna River bank .",

  "The virus has been identified in the pulmonary nodules of African elephants as far back as the 1970s . The first recognised fatal case of EEHV in an Asian elephant was identified at the National Zoo in Washington , D.C. , in 1995 ; testing on stored tissue samples was able to identify a number of earlier deaths as being due to the same virus . These cases have so far been identified as early as 1983 . Since this date , there have been a total of 54 more cases in North America and Europe , nine of which were successfully treated . The May 2009 deaths of two calves at Whipsnade Zoo were not included in this calculation . This gives a fatality rate of over 80 % among known symptomatic disease cases . In cases where antiviral medication was applied , treatment was effective in about one in three cases . As of 2005 , there were twelve cases where famciclovir had been used , eight of which were fatal . As a fraction of the overall population , it has been calculated that of the 78 Asian elephants born in captivity in North America between 1978 and 2007 , 19 are known to have died of EEHV , and five more were successfully treated with antiviral medication .",

  "A distributed element filter is an electronic filter in which capacitance , inductance and resistance ( the elements of the circuit ) are not localised in discrete capacitors , inductors and resistors as they are in conventional filters . Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass , but to block others . Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors , and the circuits so built are described by the lumped element model , which considers each element to be \" lumped together \" at one place . That model is conceptually simple , but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases , or equivalently as the wavelength decreases . The distributed element model applies at all frequencies , and is used in transmission line theory ; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line . In the distributed view of circuits , the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and are inextricably mixed together . The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance , but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate \" lumped \" capacitors and inductors . There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the microwave band ( wavelength less than one metre ) .",

  "Writing in Defining Cult Movies , Jancovich et al. quote academic Jeffrey Sconce , who defines cult films in terms of paracinema , marginal films that exist outside critical and cultural acceptance : everything from exploitation to beach party musicals to softcore pornography . However , they reject cult films as having a single unifying feature ; instead , they state that cult films are united in their \" subcultural ideology \" and opposition to mainstream tastes , itself a vague and undefinable term . Cult followings themselves can range from adoration to contempt , and they have little in common except for their celebration of nonconformity – even the bad films ridiculed by fans are artistically nonconformist , albeit unintentionally . At the same time , they state that bourgeois , masculine tastes are frequently reinforced , which makes cult films more of an internal conflict within the bourgeoisie , rather than a rebellion against it . This results in an anti @-@ academic bias despite the use of formal methodologies , such as defamiliarization . This contradiction exists in many subcultures , especially those dependent on defining themselves in terms of opposition to the mainstream .

  "Livermorium is projected to be the fourth member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 16 ( VIA ) in the Periodic Table , below polonium . While it is the least theoretically studied of the 7p elements , its chemistry is expected to be quite similar to that of polonium . The group oxidation state of + 6 is known for all the chalcogens apart from oxygen which lacks available d @-@ orbitals for expansion of its octet and is itself one of the strongest oxidizing agents among the chemical elements . Oxygen is thus limited to a maximum + 2 state , exhibited in the fluoride OF2 . The + 4 state is known for sulfur , selenium , tellurium , and polonium , undergoing a shift in stability from reducing for sulfur ( IV ) and selenium ( IV ) through being the most stable state for tellurium ( IV ) to being oxidizing in polonium ( IV ) . This suggests a decreasing stability for the higher oxidation states as the group is descended due to the increasing importance of relativistic effects , especially the inert pair effect . The most stable oxidation state of livermorium should thus be + 2 , with a rather unstable + 4 state . The + 2 state should be about as easy to form as it is for beryllium and magnesium , and the + 4 state should only be achieved with strongly electronegative ligands , such as in livermorium ( IV ) fluoride ( LvF4 ) . The + 6 state should not exist at all due to the very strong stabilization of the 7s electrons , making the valence core of livermorium only four electrons . The lighter chalcogens are also known to form a − 2 state as oxide , sulfide , selenide , telluride , and polonide ; due to the destabilization of livermorium 's 7p3 / 2 subshell , the − 2 state should be very unstable for livermorium , whose chemistry should be essentially cationic , though the larger subshell and spinor energy splittings of livermorium as compared to polonium should stabilize Lv2 − slightly .",

For the rebuttal phases in the game , Eshiro wanted to try out new things that could not be done in courtroom battles : during rebuttals , several characters come in and out during each scene at a rapid pace , providing the player with evidence , to create drama with tension . Ace Attorney Investigations has a larger focus on the environment than previous Ace Attorney titles had ; previous titles featured gameplay elements in which the player finds contradictions in suspects ' statements , whereas the goal of Ace Attorney Investigations is to find things at the crime scene that contradict the evidence the player has . The game 's third person perspective was specifically chosen to be different from the main series ' first person perspective , and to show the environment so that players can walk around inside it . The game system was designed specifically for Ace Attorney Investigations , with the aim of being different from the main series ; therefore , Eshiro felt that a lot of its features should stay within the Investigations series , and not be used in other Ace Attorney titles .",

  "Alliteration is the repetition of letters or letter @-@ sounds at the beginning of two or more words immediately succeeding each other , or at short intervals ; or the recurrence of the same letter in accented parts of words . Alliteration and assonance played a key role in structuring early Germanic , Norse and Old English forms of poetry . The alliterative patterns of early Germanic poetry interweave meter and alliteration as a key part of their structure , so that the metrical pattern determines when the listener expects instances of alliteration to occur . This can be compared to an ornamental use of alliteration in most Modern European poetry , where alliterative patterns are not formal or carried through full stanzas . Alliteration is particularly useful in languages with less rich rhyming structures .",

  "In many places during the nesting season , workers and volunteers search the coastline for nests , and researchers may also go out during the evening to look for nesting females for tagging studies and gather barnacles and tissues samples . Volunteers may , if necessary , relocate the nests for protection from threats , such as high spring tides and predators , and monitor the nests daily for disturbances . After the eggs hatch , volunteers uncover and tally hatched eggs , undeveloped eggs , and dead hatchlings . Any remaining live hatchlings are released or taken to research facilities . Typically , those that lack the vitality to hatch and climb to the surface die . Hatchlings use the journey from nest to ocean to build strength for the coming swim . Helping them to reach the ocean bypasses this strength @-@ building exercise and lowers their chances of survival .",
  "Chaco Canyon is watered by winter storms and localized summer rains that fill the arroyos . Chaco Wash is deep , and it drains to the water table located 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) below the canyon floor . Farming terraces on the mesa wall behind Chetro Ketl may have been used for growing specialized crops such as tobacco , and canals running from Pueblo Bonito to Chetro Ketl probably carried rain water . Chetro Ketl 's position in downtown Chaco and its proximity to South Gap further aided agricultural efforts near the great house , as summer storms tended to linger in the opening , funneling moisture to the area .",

  "Concerning the gameplay , Milligan criticized the fact that all enemies on a screen must be defeated to progress through some passages , and the possibility for characters and enemies to be hidden from the player 's view behind large objects . The unintuitive angle made by Arthur 's sword when attacking and the Knights ' artificial intelligence were also denounced as poorly conceived , as were the lack of animation when a character or enemy is hit . While Milligan noted no major glitches or bugs in the game , Schmitz felt the testers rushed their job . The game seemed \" unfinished and underdeveloped \" for the Video Game Bible , as well as by Milligan , who called the packaging \" nice \" and the manual readable , wondering why \" thinking human beings \" would ever agree to make a game \" this unambitious and dull \" .",

  "It soars high while searching for food , holding its wings horizontally when gliding . It flaps in short bursts which are followed by short periods of gliding . Its flight is less efficient than that of other vultures , as the wings are not as long , forming a smaller wing area . In comparison with the turkey vulture , the black vulture flaps its wings more frequently during flight . It is known to regurgitate when approached or disturbed , which assists in predator deterrence and taking flight by decreasing its takeoff weight . Like all New World vultures , the black vulture often defecates on its own legs , using the evaporation of the water in the feces and / or urine to cool itself , a process known as urohidrosis . It cools the blood vessels in the unfeathered tarsi and feet , and causes white uric acid to streak the legs . Because it lacks a syrinx , the black vulture , like other New World vultures , has very few vocalization capabilities . It is generally silent , but can make hisses and grunts when agitated or while feeding . The black vulture is gregarious , and roosts in large groups . In areas where their ranges overlap , the black vulture will roost on the bare branches of dead trees alongside groups of turkey vultures . The black vulture generally forages in groups ; a flock of black vultures can easily drive a rival turkey vulture , which is generally solitary while foraging , from a carcass .",

Others have noted that the accuracy of horizon astronomy is limited by variations in refraction near the horizon . A deeper criticism of Green archaeoastronomy is that while it can answer whether there was likely to be an interest in astronomy in past times , its lack of a social element means that it struggles to answer why people would be interested , which makes it of limited use to people asking questions about the society of the past . Keith Kintigh wrote : \" To put it bluntly , in many cases it doesn 't matter much to the progress of anthropology whether a particular archaeoastronomical claim is right or wrong because the information doesn ’ t inform the current interpretive questions . \" Nonetheless the study of alignments remains a staple of archaeoastronomical research , especially in Europe .",

  "Many mutagens fit into the space between two adjacent base pairs , this is called intercalation . Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules ; examples include ethidium bromide , acridines , daunomycin , and doxorubicin . For an intercalator to fit between base pairs , the bases must separate , distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix . This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication , causing toxicity and mutations . As a result , DNA intercalators may be carcinogens , and in the case of thalidomide , a teratogen . Others such as benzo [ a ] pyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication . Nevertheless , due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication , other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells .",

  "The Nuova Cronica by Villani stands as a milestone achievement in the history of European chronicles . Mark Phillips writes that Villani 's account provided the basis for the historical works of Leonardo Bruni and Niccolò Machiavelli . Villani 's extensive work has also allowed for greater study of his contemporary Dante Alighieri by modern historians . Yet the Nuova Cronica also has its limitations , mostly with relying on inaccurate accounts of eras preceding its compilation . Earlier chronicles , such as the Chronica de origine civitatis of 1231 , provided little substantive or factual material , relying instead on legendary accounts and not venturing to analyze their historicity or question their validity . The historian Nicolai Rubinstein called Villani 's chronicle a much more \" mature expression \" of validated Florentine history , yet Villani still relied on the Chronica de origine civitatis for covering events of Florence 's earliest history ; hence he adopted some of the highly questionable legendary accounts as true historical events . Although Villani 's work is most reliable when it comes to historical events that occurred within his lifetime , there are some factual errors even in the contemporary biographies he presented . Kenneth R. Bartlett writes that Villani 's interest and elaboration in economic details , statistical information , and political and psychological insight signifies him as a more modern late medieval chronicler of Europe . However , he adds that Villani 's reliance upon divine providence aligned him more with the medieval tradition of chroniclers than the more credible historians of the Renaissance .",

The other mechanism is the nonlexical or sublexical route , which is the process whereby the reader can \" sound out \" a written word .

  "Changeling begins with an abduction , but largely avoids framing the story as a family drama to concentrate on a portrait of a woman whose desire for independence is seen as a threat to male @-@ dominated society . The film depicts 1920s Los Angeles as a city in which the judgment of men takes precedence ; women are labeled \" hysterical and unreliable \" if they dare to question it . Film critic Prairie Miller said that in its portrayal of female courage the film was \" about as feminist as Hollywood can get \" , and that because of this it had been the subject of sexist disdain . She compared this with the sexism shown to the women in Changeling and those who vied for high political office in 2008 . Miller surmised that attitudes to independent , career @-@ minded women had not changed significantly in the intervening years : Collins defies male @-@ generated cultural expectations that women are not suited for professional careers and are punished for it . Rather than \" an expression of feminist awareness \" , David Denby argues , the film — like Eastwood 's Million Dollar Baby — is \" a case of awed respect for a woman who was strong and enduring \" . The portrait of a vulnerable woman whose mental state is manipulated by the authorities was likened to the treatment of Ingrid Bergman 's character in Gaslight ( 1944 ) , who also wondered if she might be insane ; Eastwood cited photographs that show Collins smiling with the child she knows is not hers . Like many other women of the period who were deemed disruptive , Collins is forced into the secret custody of a mental institution . The film shows that psychiatry became a tool in the gender politics of the era , only a few years after women 's suffrage in the United States was guaranteed by the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment . As women ceased to be second @-@ class citizens and began to assert their independence , the male establishment used mental institutions in an effort to disempower them ; in common with other unmanageable women , Collins is subjected to medical treatment designed to break her spirit and compel obedience , though some of the treatments , specifically the electroconvulsive therapy depicted in the film , did not exist ca . 1928 @-@ 1930 . The film quotes the testimony of the psychiatrist who treated Collins . Eastwood said the testimony evidenced how women were prejudged , and that the behavior of the police reflected how women were seen at the time . He quoted the words of the officer who sent Collins to the mental facility : \" ' Something is wrong with you . You 're an independent woman . ' \" Clint Eastwood said , \" The period could not accept [ it ] \" .",

  "The enormous effort of the estimated population of 100 to 150 thousands of residents of the Gniezno region , who were involved in building or modernizing Gniezno and several other main Piast gords ( all of the local supply of oak timber was exhausted ) , was made in response to a perceived deadly threat , not just to help them pursue regional conquests . After 935 , when the Gniezno people were probably already led by Mieszko 's father Siemomysł , the Czechs conquered Silesia and soon moved also against Germany . The fear of desecration of their tribal cult center by the advancing Czechs could have mobilized the community . Also a Polabian Slavs uprising was suppressed around 940 by Germany under Otto I , and the eastbound moving Saxons must have added to the sense of danger at that time ( unless the Piast state was already allied with Otto , helping restrain the Polabians ) . When the situation stabilized , the Piast state consolidated and the huge gords turned out to be handy for facilitating the Piast 's own expansion , led at this stage by Siemomysł .",

  "Peers were , and still are hypothetically , subject to impeachment . Impeachment was a procedure distinct from the aforementioned procedure of trial in the House of Lords , though the House of Lords is the court in both cases . Charges were brought by the House of Commons , not a Grand Jury . Additionally , while in normal cases the House of Lords tried peers only for felonies or treason , in impeachments the charges could include felonies , treason and misdemeanours . The case directly came before the House of Lords , rather than being referred to it by a writ of certiorari . The Lord High Steward presided only if a peer was charged with high treason ; otherwise the Lord Chancellor presided . Other procedures in trials of impeachment were similar , however , to trials before the House of Lords : at the conclusion of the trial , the spiritual peers withdrew , and the temporal Lords gave their votes on their honour . The last impeachment was that of Henry Dundas , 1st Viscount Melville , in 1806 for misappropriating public money ( he was acquitted ) . Since then , impeachment has become an obsolete procedure in the United Kingdom .",

  "The Latin tradition consists of three authors writing in the later 4th and early 5th centuries — Jerome , Orosius , and Vincent of Lérins . The tradition is represented in Jerome 's Liber de viris inlustribus and Chronicon , Orosius ' Historiarum Adversum Paganos , and Vincent of Lérins ' Commonitorum Primum . Most scholars hold that all of these accounts ultimately derive from Eusebius of Caesarea 's Historia . These authors follow the Greek tradition , and probably takes all of their information from Eusebius , Eusebius ' sources , or Jerome . These authors are more forceful in their claims than Eusebius , as demonstrated by their use of primus , or \" first \" , as in \" first Christian emperor \" , when referring to Philip . Jerome is the most important , both since he is the earliest of the three , and because , as the editor and translator of Eusebius ' Chronicon ( Chronicle ) , he is closest to Eusebius .",

  "Coinage began on the first United States silver dollar , known as the Flowing Hair dollar , in 1794 following the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint . The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89 @.@ 2 % silver and 10 @.@ 8 % copper . However , Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual fineness , so it was decided to strike them in an unauthorized alloy of 90 % silver instead .

  "According to Eliot biographer Lyndall Gordon , in \" Ash Wednesday \" and the Ariel poems , \" Eliot wonders if he does not belong to those who espouse Christianity officially without being properly committed , whose ostentatious piety is ' tainted with a self @-@ conceit . ' \" The poem is inherently tied to Eliot 's religious conversion experience , and connected to Eliot 's reading of Anglican divine Lancelot Andrewes during this time . Andrewes , in an 1619 Ash Wednesday sermon , emphasised that conversion \" must come from both mind and heart , thought and feeling , ' the principall [ sic ] and most proper act of a true turning to God . ' \" Andrewes ' words are channelled again , when Eliot 's Simeon \" sees a faith that he cannot inhabit in \" the still unspeaking and unspoken Word ' \" . Eliot uses the image of the winding staircase — an image that also appears in \" Ash Wednesday \" — which Gordon indicates is a direct reference to Andrewes ' sermon . According to Gordon , \" Eliot 's penitent ... ' turning on the winding stair ' , acts out the two mental turns Andrewes prescribed for a conversion : a turn that looks forward to God and a turn that looks backward to one ’ s sins , sentencing oneself for the past \" .",

  "The regency council of the infant King Henry VI was inclined to have James released as soon as possible . In the early months of 1423 their attempts to resolve the issue met with little response from the Scots , clearly influenced by the Albany Stewarts and adherents . Archibald , Earl of Douglas was an astute and adaptable power in Southern Scotland whose influence even eclipsed that of the Albany Stewarts . Despite his complicity in James 's brother 's death in Albany 's castle in 1402 Douglas was still able to engage with the king . From 1421 , Douglas had been in regular contact with James and they formed an alliance that was to prove pivotal in 1423 . Although Douglas was the pre @-@ eminent Scottish magnate his position in the borders and Lothians was jeopardized — not only did he have to forcibly retake Edinburgh Castle from his own designated warden but was very likely under threat from the earls of Angus and March . In return for James 's endorsement of Douglas 's position in the kingdom , the earl was able to deliver his affinity in the cause of the king 's home @-@ coming . Also , the relationship between Murdoch — now Duke of Albany following his father 's death in 1420 — and his own appointee Bishop William Lauder seemed to be under strain perhaps evidence of an influential grouping at odds with Murdoch 's stance . Pressure from these advocates for the king almost certainly compelled Murdoch to agree to a general council in August 1423 when it was agreed that a mission should be sent to England to negotiate James 's release . James 's relationship with the House of Lancaster changed in February 1423 when he married Joan Beaufort , a cousin of Henry VI and the niece of Thomas , Duke of Exeter and Henry , Bishop of Winchester . A ransom treaty of £ 40 @,@ 000 sterling ( less a dowry remittance of 10 @,@ 000 marks ) was agreed at Durham on 28 March 1424 to which James attached his own seal .

  "The first standard strips began to emerge in the 1870s , with many clubs opting for colours associated with the schools or other sporting organisations from which the clubs had emerged . Blackburn Rovers , for example , adopted shirts of a halved design based on those of the team for former pupils of Malvern College , one of the schools where the sport had developed . Their original colours of light blue and white were chosen to reflect an association with Cambridge University , where a number of the club 's founders had been educated . Colours and designs often changed dramatically between matches , with Bolton Wanderers turning out in both pink shirts and white shirts with red spots within the same year . Rather than the modern shorts , players wore long knickerbockers or full @-@ length trousers , often with a belt or even braces . Lord Kinnaird , an early star of the game , was noted for always being resplendent in long white trousers . There were no numbers printed on shirts to identify individual players , and the programme for an 1875 match between Queen 's Park and Wanderers in Glasgow identifies the players by the colours of their caps or stockings . The first shin pads were worn in 1874 by the Nottingham Forest player Sam Weller Widdowson , who cut down a pair of cricket pads and wore them outside his stockings . Initially the concept was ridiculed but it soon caught on with other players . By the turn of the century pads had become smaller and were being worn inside the stockings .",

  "Unlike other species of the family Cotingidae , the Guianan cock @-@ of @-@ the @-@ rock makes its nest on rocky cliff faces and caves rather than in the trees . The female lays one or two eggs in the nest of mud and plant material , which is attached by saliva to a vertical rock . The male does not participate in the building of the nest or the incubation of the eggs . Eggs typically incubate for 27 – 28 days . The ideal nesting sites for this species are usually located in a cave or vertical rock face with crevices that provide some shelter and protection from the elements . The nests themselves are solid moldings formed from mud and plant material deposited into the crevices . Due to the solid nature of these nests , they typically persist from one breeding season to the next . Females will make repairs to their nests as a breeding season begins .",

  "Individuals differ in their inherited tendency to develop cancer , and cancer is a genetic disease . The process of cancer development in the body is a combination of events . Mutations occasionally occur within cells in the body as they divide . Although these mutations will not be inherited by any offspring , they can affect the behavior of cells , sometimes causing them to grow and divide more frequently . There are biological mechanisms that attempt to stop this process ; signals are given to inappropriately dividing cells that should trigger cell death , but sometimes additional mutations occur that cause cells to ignore these messages . An internal process of natural selection occurs within the body and eventually mutations accumulate within cells to promote their own growth , creating a cancerous tumor that grows and invades various tissues of the body .",

Each of the other candidates had hindrances to his nomination : Bayard had spoken in favor of secession in 1861 , making him unacceptable to Northerners ; Butler , conversely , was reviled throughout the South for his actions during the Civil War ; Thurman was generally well liked , but was growing old and infirm , and his views on the silver question were uncertain . Cleveland , too , had detractors — Tammany remained opposed to him — but the nature of his enemies made him still more friends . Cleveland led on the first ballot , with 392 votes out of 820 . On the second ballot , Tammany threw its support behind Butler , but the rest of the delegates shifted to Cleveland , who won . Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana was selected as his running mate .",

  "The fundamental idea of \" restoration \" or \" Christian Primitivism \" is that problems or deficiencies in the church can be corrected by using the primitive church as a \" normative model . \" The call for restoration is often justified on the basis of a \" falling away \" that corrupted the original purity of the church . This falling away is identified with the development of Catholicism and denominationalism . New Testament verses that discuss future apostasy ( 2 Thessalonians 2 : 3 ) and heresy ( e.g. , Acts 20 : 29 , 1 Timothy 4 : 1 , 2 Tim 4 : l @-@ 4 : 4 ) are understood to predict this falling away . The logic of \" restoration \" could imply that the \" true \" church completely disappeared and thus lead towards exclusivism . Another view of restoration is that the \" true Church ... has always existed by grace and not by human engineering \" ( italics in the original ) . In this view the goal is to \" help Christians realize the ideal of the church in the New Testament – to restore the church as conceived in the mind of Christ \" ( italics in the original ) . Early Restoration Movement leaders did not believe that the church had ceased to exist , but instead sought to reform and reunite the church . A number of congregations ' web sites explicitly state that the true church never disappeared . The belief in a general falling away is not seen as inconsistent with the idea that a faithful remnant of the church never entirely disappeared . Some have attempted to trace this remnant through the intervening centuries between the New Testament and the beginning of the Restoration Movement in the early 1800s .",

  "New markets in Europe and South America increased the demand for Britain 's cheap cotton goods . Supplies of raw cotton were exported from plantations in the United States to Manchester . From the markets in Manchester , mill owners from Chadderton and neighbouring towns bought their cotton to be processed into yarn and cloth . Supplies were cut during the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861 – 65 as a result of the American Civil War , leading to the formation of the Chadderton Local Board of Health in 1873 , whose purpose was to ensure social security and maintain hygiene and sanitation in the locality following the crisis . Despite a brief economic depression , the urban growth of Chadderton accelerated after the famine . The profitability of factory based cotton spinning meant that much of Chadderton 's plentiful cheap open land , used for farming since antiquity , vanished under distinctive rectangular multi @-@ storey brick @-@ built factories — 35 by 1891 . Chadderton 's former villages and hamlets agglomerated as a mill town around these factories and a network of newly created roads , canals and railways . The Chadderton landscape was \" dominated by mill chimneys , many with the mill name picked out in white brick \" . Neighbouring Oldham ( which by the 1870s had emerged as the largest and most productive mill town in the world ) encroached upon Chadderton 's eastern boundary , urbanising the town and surrounds , and forming a continuous urban cotton @-@ spinning district with Royton , Lees and Shaw and Crompton — the Oldham parliamentary constituency — which at its peak was responsible for 13 per cent of the world 's cotton production . These Victorian era developments shifted the commercial focus away from Chadderton Fold to the major arterial Middleton Road , by Chadderton 's eastern boundary with Oldham . Sixty cotton mills were constructed in Chadderton between 1778 and 1926 , and 6 @,@ 000 people , a quarter of Chadderton 's population , worked in these factories by the beginning of the 20th century .

Stott 's mills in Chadderton were some of the largest to be built in the United Kingdom , multiplying the town 's industrial capacity and in turn increasing its population and productivity .",

  "In neuroscience , a great deal of effort has gone into investigating how the perceived world of conscious awareness is constructed inside the brain . The process is generally thought to involve two primary mechanisms : ( 1 ) hierarchical processing of sensory inputs , and ( 2 ) memory . Signals arising from sensory organs are transmitted to the brain and then processed in a series of stages , which extract multiple types of information from the raw input . In the visual system , for example , sensory signals from the eyes are transmitted to the thalamus and then to the primary visual cortex ; inside the cerebral cortex they are sent to areas that extract features such as three @-@ dimensional structure , shape , color , and motion . Memory comes into play in at least two ways . First , it allows sensory information to be evaluated in the context of previous experience . Second , and even more importantly , working memory allows information to be integrated over time so that it can generate a stable representation of the world — Gerald Edelman expressed this point vividly by titling one of his books about consciousness The Remembered Present . In computational neuroscience , Bayesian approaches to brain function have been used to understand both the evaluation of sensory information in light of previous experience , and the integration of information over time . Bayesian models of the brain are probabilistic inference models , in which the brain takes advantage of prior knowledge to interpret uncertain sensory inputs in order to formulate a conscious percept ; Bayesian models have successfully predicted many perceptual phenomena in vision and the nonvisual senses .",

  "When Hayes appeared to have lost the presidential election the following month to Democrat Samuel Tilden , the Republicans launched efforts to reverse the result in Southern states where they held the governorship : South Carolina , Louisiana , and Florida . If Hayes won all three states , he would take the election by a single electoral vote . Grant asked Garfield to serve as a \" neutral observer \" in the recount in Louisiana . The observers soon recommended to the state electoral commissions that Hayes be declared the winner — Garfield recommended that the entire vote of West Feliciana Parish , which had given Tilden a sizable majority , be thrown out . The Republican governors of the three states certified that Hayes had won their states , to the outrage of Democrats , who had the state legislatures submit rival returns , and threatened to prevent the counting of the electoral vote — under the Constitution , Congress is the final arbiter of the election . Congress then passed a bill establishing the Electoral Commission , to determine the winner . Although he opposed the Commission , feeling that Congress should count the vote and proclaim Hayes victorious , Garfield was appointed to it over the objections of Democrats that he was too partisan . Hayes emerged the victor by a Commission vote of 8 to 7 , with all eight votes being cast by Republican politicians or appointees of that party to the Supreme Court .

  "The period that historians refer to as the \" tyranny \" of Richard II began towards the end of the 1390s . The king had Gloucester , Arundel and Warwick arrested in July 1397 . The timing of these arrests and Richard 's motivation are not entirely clear . Although one chronicle suggested that a plot was being planned against the king , there is no evidence that this was the case . It is more likely that Richard had simply come to feel strong enough to safely retaliate against these three men for their role in events of 1386 – 88 and eliminate them as threats to his power . Arundel was the first of the three to be brought to trial , at the parliament of September 1397 . After a heated quarrel with the king , he was condemned and executed . Gloucester was being held prisoner by the Earl of Nottingham at Calais while awaiting his trial . As the time for the trial drew near , Nottingham brought news that Gloucester was dead . It is thought likely that the king had ordered him to be killed to avoid the disgrace of executing a prince of the blood . Warwick was also condemned to death , but his life was spared and his sentence reduced to life imprisonment . Arundel 's brother Thomas Arundel , the Archbishop of Canterbury , was exiled for life . Richard then took his persecution of adversaries to the localities . While recruiting retainers for himself in various counties , he prosecuted local men who had been loyal to the appellants .
