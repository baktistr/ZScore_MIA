  "In 2007 , the New Jersey Department of Transportation proposed the elimination of the Netcong Traffic Circle , located at the intersections of U.S. Route 46 and Route 183 just north of the interchange with Interstate 80 . The project was to produce two outcomes : replacement of the New Jersey Transit bridge that Route 183 crosses , and the elimination of the Netcong Circle with a signalized intersection . The project had issues dealing with the vertical clearance of the overpass for U.S. Route 46 westbound . The removal of the circle would eliminate this bridge , and the land would go to use as the new signalized intersection , with pedestrian and bicycle fittings . The entire project cost about $ 13 @.@ 3 million ( 2009 USD ) of state and local funds to construct . The Netcong Circle was replaced with a temporary junction in January 2013 ; the permanent intersection configuration opened in August of that year . The new bridge over the New Jersey Transit line opened in March 2013 .",
  "Consonant symbols in Khmer are divided into two groups , or series . The first series carries the inherent vowel / ɑː / while the second series carries the inherent vowel / ɔː / . The Khmer names of the series , / aʔkʰosaʔ / ( ' voiceless ' ) and / kʰosaʔ / ( ' voiced ' ) , respectively , indicate that the second series consonants were used to represent the voiced phonemes of Old Khmer . As the voicing of stops was lost , however , the contrast shifted to the phonation of the attached vowels which , in turn , evolved into a simple difference of vowel quality , often by diphthongization . This process has resulted in the Khmer alphabet having two symbols for most consonant phonemes and each vowel symbol having two possible readings , depending on the series of the initial consonant :",

  "Intertwining pink silk ribbons are draped over the mirror and curl over its frame . The ribbon 's function has been the subject of much debate by art historians ; suggestions include an allusion to the fetters used by Cupid to bind lovers , that it was used to hang the mirror , and that it was used to blindfold Venus moments before . The critic Julián Gallego found Cupid 's facial expression to be so melancholy that he interprets the ribbons as fetters binding the god to the image of Beauty , and gave the painting the title \" Amor conquered by Beauty \" .",
  "Ununpentium is predicted to be the third member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 15 ( VA ) in the Periodic Table , below bismuth . In this group , each member is known to portray the group oxidation state of + 5 but with differing stability . For nitrogen , the + 5 state is mostly a formal explanation of molecules like N2O5 : it is very difficult to have five covalent bonds to nitrogen due to the inability of the small nitrogen atom to accommodate five ligands . The + 5 state is well represented for the essentially non @-@ relativistic typical pnictogens phosphorus , arsenic , and antimony . However , for bismuth it becomes rare due to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbitals known as the inert pair effect , so that the 6s electrons are reluctant to bond chemically . It is expected that ununpentium will have an inert pair effect for both the 7s and the 7p1 / 2 electrons , as the binding energy of the lone 7p3 / 2 electron is noticeably lower than that of the 7p1 / 2 electrons . Nitrogen ( I ) and bismuth ( I ) are known but rare and ununpentium ( I ) is likely to show some unique properties , probably behaving more like thallium ( I ) than bismuth ( I ) . Because of spin @-@ orbit coupling , flerovium may display closed @-@ shell or noble gas @-@ like properties ; if this is the case , ununpentium will likely be typically monovalent as a result , since the cation Uup + will have the same electron configuration as flerovium , perhaps giving ununpentium some alkali metal character . However , the Uup3 + cation would behave like its true lighter homolog Bi3 + . The 7s electrons are too stabilized to be able to contribute chemically and hence the + 5 state should be impossible and ununpentium may be considered to have only three valence electrons . Ununpentium would be quite a reactive metal , with an oxidation potential of about 1 @.@ 5 V.",
  "The war had also demonstrated to the Romans that the defensive system in the East , as put in place by Augustus , was no longer adequate . Thus the following years saw a major reorganization of the Roman East : the client kingdoms of Pontus and Colchis ( in 64 AD ) , Cilicia , Commagene and Lesser Armenia ( in 72 AD ) were made into Roman provinces , the number of legions in the area increased , and Roman presence in the Caucasian client states of Iberia and Albania strengthened , with the aim of strategically encircling Armenia . Direct Roman control was extended to the entire line of the Euphrates , marking the beginning of the Eastern limes that would survive until the Muslim conquests of the 7th century .",

  "The semantic study of meaning assumes that meaning is located in a relation between signs and meanings that are firmly established through social convention . However , semantics does not study the way in which social conventions are made and affect language . Rather , when studying the way in which words and signs are used , it is often the case that words have different meanings , depending on the social context of use . An important example of this is the process called deixis , which describes the way in which certain words refer to entities through their relation between a specific point in time and space when the word is uttered . Such words are , for example , the word , \" I \" ( which designates the person speaking ) , \" now \" ( which designates the moment of speaking ) , and \" here \" ( which designates the position of speaking ) . Signs also change their meanings over time , as the conventions governing their usage gradually change . The study of how the meaning of linguistic expressions changes depending on context is called pragmatics . Deixis is an important part of the way that we use language to point out entities in the world . Pragmatics is concerned with the ways in which language use is patterned and how these patterns contribute to meaning . For example , in all languages , linguistic expressions can be used not just to transmit information , but to perform actions . Certain actions are made only through language , but nonetheless have tangible effects , e.g. the act of \" naming \" , which creates a new name for some entity , or the act of \" pronouncing someone man and wife \" , which creates a social contract of marriage . These types of acts are called speech acts , although they can of course also be carried out through writing or hand signing .",

The tidal effect of the Sun on Earth 's oceans is almost half that of the Moon , and their gravitational interplay is responsible for spring and neap tides .",

Many agencies had programs in place to ensure that members of the government were not communists . Minton 's vote proved to be the deciding factor in cases regarding loyalty tests . In the case of Bailey v. Richardson , Minton 's vote upheld the legality of the loyalty tests , while in the decision he authored in the case of Joint Anti @-@ Fascist Refugee Committee v. McGrath , he voted to uphold the plaintiff 's position that he had been terminated illegally because of his support of fascist ideology . Minton 's position gradually shifted to allowing the loyalty tests to take place , and in Adler v. Board of Ed. of City of New York he wrote the majority opinion allowing the tests and upholding New York 's Feinberg Law . This proved to be the most important vote as it allowed the tests to be given with only minimal suspicion of a person 's disloyalty to the government .",

Becher decided to sail up a channel of the Taedong River known as Short Cut , which according to his charts should have allowed him five to ten feet of clearance . The chart proved inaccurate , and Warramunga ran aground at 23 : 15 ; Becher 's only option was to wait for the rising tide to float the destroyer off . Warramunga came free at 23 : 50 without having sustained damage , and was able to resume her mission , escorting troop transports south . Later , Becher brought Warramunga alongside Bataan and entreated the latter 's commander , via megaphone , to keep quiet about the incident .

  "Palladio would often model his villa elevations on Roman temple facades . The temple influence , often in a cruciform design , later became a trademark of his work . Palladian villas are usually built with three floors : a rusticated basement or ground floor , containing the service and minor rooms . Above this , the piano nobile accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps , containing the principal reception and bedrooms , and above it is a low mezzanine floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation . The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3 : 4 and 4 : 5 , and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios .

  "Although the Antarctic scallop has a circum @-@ polar distribution , this is very disjunct , and overall it is not common . In some places it is found at densities of up to 90 per square metre and in Terra Nova Bay in the Ross Sea , at depths between 40 metres ( 130 ft ) and 80 metres ( 260 ft ) , some scallop beds were found to be so crowded that adult individuals were lying on top of others . In other locations that seem eminently suitable in many ways , it was entirely absent . A possible explanation for this lies in the fact that its paper thin shell is characteristic of bivalves living in stable , deep water areas with little water movement . The shallower locations in which it now thrives are characterised by being protected bays or by having extensive sea ice coverage , each of which provides a stable environment unaffected by storm waves and where iceberg scouring does not normally occur . It is also absent from habitats dominated by other benthic suspension feeding communities whereas it is found in habitats with soft sediments and no dominant cnidarian and sponge communities . This might be because its larvae face such heavy predation in these locations that it is unable to establish itself .",

  "As the December release date approached , United Artists launched a campaign to reform public perception of the film , downplaying the role of Tom Cruise as a German war hero and instead pitching Valkyrie as \" a character @-@ driven suspense thriller \" . The new campaign also played up the reputation of director Bryan Singer , who had directed the thrillers The Usual Suspects ( 1995 ) and Apt Pupil ( 1998 ) . Terry Press urged foregoing an awards campaign for the film ; Cruise agreed with the consultant , while Singer was disappointed about the decision . Instead , the studio focused on audience appeal in a competitive time frame in late December . A second theatrical trailer and a new poster were unveiled in October 2008 by United Artists to renew Valkyrie 's viability with audiences and accolades . The poster was designed to have flashy graphics and to emulate the posters from the war films The Great Escape ( 1963 ) and The Dirty Dozen ( 1967 ) in having a team as a central visual . The team element was based on market research from the studio 's focus groups who indicated that they liked Cruise as \" a character leading a group of people toward solving a problem \" . The new trailer accentuated action , and was widely considered an improvement over the first trailer . An internal MGM memo reported the reception of the trailer by online communities to be \" significantly favorable \" compared to the previous trailer . The studio sought two demographic quadrants : males over 35 years old as well as younger males . Since United Artists reported that the film cost $ 75 million to make and that $ 60 million was spent on marketing , the studio faced high financial stakes . The film also tested the determination of its distributor Metro @-@ Goldwyn @-@ Mayer and the mettle of Cruise as a superstar .",

  "\" Ode to a Nightingale \" is the longest of the 1819 odes with 8 stanzas containing 10 lines each . The poem begins by describing the state of the poet , using negative statements to intensify the description of the poet 's physical state such as \" numbless pains \" and \" not through envy of thy happy lot \" ( lines 1 – 5 ) . While the ode is written \" to a Nightingale \" , the emphasis of the first line is placed upon the narrator rather than the bird , and Helen Vendler suggests that the negation of the reader as a party in the discourse happens just as the song of the nightingale becomes the \" voice of pure self @-@ expression \" . In the third stanza , the poet asks the nightingale to \" Fade far away \" , casting it off just as the narrator in \" Ode to Indolence \" rejects the Love , Ambition , and Poesy and the poet in \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" banishes the figures on the urn to silence . In the fourth stanza , the poet states that he will fly to the nightingale rather than it to him , moving upon the \" wings of Poesy \" , which leaves Walter Jackson Bate to believe that while the poet intends to identify with the bird by describing the poem as being \" to \" it , the real identification in the narrative exists between the poet and his perceptions of the nightingale 's song . In its closing , the poem questions whether the bird 's song has been real or part of a dream : \" Was it a vision , or a waking dream ? / Fled is that music : — do I wake or sleep ? \" ( lines 79 – 80 ) , and the theme of imagination once again arises as the poet appears , according to Timothy Hilton , unable to distinguish between his own artistic imagination and the song which he believes to have spurred it into action .",

  "The giant planets ( Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus , and Neptune ) formed further out , beyond the frost line , the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where the material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid . The ices that formed the Jovian planets were more abundant than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial planets , allowing the giant planets to grow massive enough to capture hydrogen and helium , the lightest and most abundant elements . Planetesimals beyond the frost line accumulated up to 4 M ⊕ within about 3 million years . Today , the four giant planets comprise just under 99 % of all the mass orbiting the Sun . Theorists believe it is no accident that Jupiter lies just beyond the frost line . Because the frost line accumulated large amounts of water via evaporation from infalling icy material , it created a region of lower pressure that increased the speed of orbiting dust particles and halted their motion toward the Sun . In effect , the frost line acted as a barrier that caused material to accumulate rapidly at ~ 5 AU from the Sun . This excess material coalesced into a large embryo ( or core ) on the order of 10 M ⊕ , which began to accumulate an envelope via accretion of gas from the surrounding disc at an ever increasing rate . Once the envelope mass became about equal to the solid core mass , growth proceeded very rapidly , reaching about 150 Earth masses ~ 105 years thereafter and finally topping out at 318 M ⊕ . Saturn may owe its substantially lower mass simply to having formed a few million years after Jupiter , when there was less gas available to consume .",

  "With Lana 's boyfriend gone by season two , the door opened for Clark , but Welling stated he understood why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart , even after Whitney 's departure : \" There 's the cliché that television shows with a main lover interest fail once they get it together . \" After briefly being together at the beginning of the fifth season , Clark 's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five . Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way , but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana 's safety in jeopardy .

To achieve the rich overdubbed sound of the album on stage , Townshend wanted Chris Stainton ( who had played piano on some tracks ) to join as a touring member . Daltrey objected to this and believed the Who 's performances should only have the four core members .

Their parent cloud can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus , or as significant as a thunderstorm . Waterspouts normally develop as their parent clouds are in the process of development , and it is theorized that they spin up as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal wind shear near the surface , and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus or thunderstorm . Weak tornadoes , known as landspouts , across eastern Colorado have been witnessed to develop in a similar manner . An outbreak occurred in the Great Lakes in late September and early October 2003 along a lake effect band .

  "After the 1929 London festival The Times music critic wrote that Delius \" belongs to no school , follows no tradition and is like no other composer in the form , content or style of his music \" . This \" extremely individual and personal idiom \" was , however , the product of a long musical apprenticeship , during which the composer absorbed many influences . The earliest significant experiences in his artistic development came , Delius later asserted , from the sounds of the plantation songs carried down the river to him at Solano Grove . It was this singing , he told Fenby , that first gave him the urge to express himself in music ; thus , writes Fenby , many of Delius 's early works are \" redolent of Negro hymnology and folk @-@ song \" , a sound \" not heard before in the orchestra , and seldom since \" . Delius 's familiarity with \" black \" music possibly predates his American adventures ; during the 1870s a popular singing group , the Fisk Jubilee Singers from Nashville , Tennessee , toured Britain and Europe , giving several well @-@ received concerts in Bradford . When Delius wrote to Elgar in 1933 of the \" beautiful four @-@ part harmonies \" of the black plantation workers , he may have been unconsciously alluding to the spirituals sung by the Fisk group .",

  "One of the things that have marked the modern NFL as different from other major professional sports leagues is the apparent parity between its 32 teams . While from time to time , dominant teams have arisen , the league has been cited as one of the few where every team has a realistic chance of winning the championship from year to year . The league 's complex labor agreement with its players ' union , which mandates a hard salary cap and revenue sharing between its clubs , prevents the richest teams from stockpiling the best players and gives even teams in smaller cities such as Green Bay and New Orleans the opportunity to compete for the Super Bowl . One of the chief architects of this labor agreement was former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue , who presided over the league from 1989 to 2006 . In addition to providing parity between the clubs , the current labor contract , established in 1993 and renewed in 1998 and 2006 , has kept player salaries low — the lowest among the four major league sports in the United States — and has helped make the NFL the only major American professional sports league since 1993 not to suffer any player strike or work stoppage .",

  "Stars generate energy by the nuclear fusion of elements . Unlike the Sun , massive stars possess the mass needed to fuse elements that have an atomic mass greater than hydrogen and helium , albeit at increasingly higher temperatures and pressures , causing increasingly shorter stellar life spans . The degeneracy pressure of electrons and the energy generated by these fusion reactions are sufficient to counter the force of gravity and prevent the star from collapsing , maintaining stellar equilibrium . The star fuses increasingly higher mass elements , starting with hydrogen and then helium , progressing up through the periodic table until a core of iron and nickel is produced .

  "Almost a thousand impact craters on Venus are evenly distributed across its surface . On other cratered bodies , such as Earth and the Moon , craters show a range of states of degradation . On the Moon , degradation is caused by subsequent impacts , whereas on Earth it is caused by wind and rain erosion . On Venus , about 85 % of the craters are in pristine condition . The number of craters , together with their well @-@ preserved condition , indicates the planet underwent a global resurfacing event about 300 – 600 million years ago , followed by a decay in volcanism . Whereas Earth 's crust is in continuous motion , Venus is thought to be unable to sustain such a process . Without plate tectonics to dissipate heat from its mantle , Venus instead undergoes a cyclical process in which mantle temperatures rise until they reach a critical level that weakens the crust . Then , over a period of about 100 million years , subduction occurs on an enormous scale , completely recycling the crust .",

  "Also known as single cell thunderstorms , these are the typical summer thunderstorms in many temperate locales . They also occur in the cool unstable air which often follows the passage of a cold front from the sea during winter . Within a cluster of thunderstorms , the term \" cell \" refers to each separate principal updraft . Thunderstorm cells occasionally form in isolation , as the occurrence of one thunderstorm can develop an outflow boundary which sets up new thunderstorm development . Such storms are rarely severe and are a result of local atmospheric instability ; hence the term \" air mass thunderstorm \" . When such storms have a brief period of severe weather associated with them , it is known as a pulse severe storm .

  "In a letter dated August 1 , 1835 , Patterson proposed that Sully create a Seated Liberty figure for the obverse , suggesting that the \" figure be in a sitting posture — sitting , for example , on a rock . \" Patterson also suggested that the seated figure should hold in her right hand a pileus atop a pole to be \" emblematic of Liberty \" . Numismatic historian Don Taxay notes the similarity between Patterson 's Seated Liberty concept and designs already in use on British copper coinage : \" Liberty thus emerged as a refurbished Britannia , her trident replaced by a staff and pileus . \" In the same letter , Patterson also informed Sully of his vision for the reverse , which Peale would execute : \" I propose an Eagle flying , and rising in flight , amidst a constellation , irregularly dispersed , of 24 stars [ representing the number of states then forming the Union ] , and carrying in its claws a scroll with the words E PLURIBUS UNUM \" . Patterson preferred a soaring eagle because he believed that the heraldic eagle commonly used on American coins , which he dismissed as a \" mere creature of imagination \" , was unappealing as a design .

  "The Appaloosa is an American horse breed best known for its colorful spotted coat pattern . There is a wide range of body types within the breed , stemming from the influence of multiple breeds of horses throughout its history . Each horse 's color pattern is genetically the result of various spotting patterns overlaid on top of one of several recognized base coat colors . The color pattern of the Appaloosa is of interest to those who study equine coat color genetics , as it and several other physical characteristics are linked to the leopard complex mutation ( LP ) . Appaloosas are prone to develop equine recurrent uveitis and congenital stationary night blindness ; the latter has been linked to the leopard complex .",

  "Proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome with covalent modification of a lysine residue that requires the coordinated reactions of three enzymes . In the first step , a ubiquitin @-@ activating enzyme ( known as E1 ) hydrolyzes ATP and adenylylates a ubiquitin molecule . This is then transferred to E1 's active @-@ site cysteine residue in concert with the adenylylation of a second ubiquitin . This adenylylated ubiquitin is then transferred to a cysteine of a second enzyme , ubiquitin @-@ conjugating enzyme ( E2 ) . In the last step , a member of a highly diverse class of enzymes known as ubiquitin ligases ( E3 ) recognizes the specific protein to be ubiquitinated and catalyzes the transfer of ubiquitin from E2 to this target protein . A target protein must be labeled with at least four ubiquitin monomers ( in the form of a polyubiquitin chain ) before it is recognized by the proteasome lid . It is therefore the E3 that confers substrate specificity to this system . The number of E1 , E2 , and E3 proteins expressed depends on the organism and cell type , but there are many different E3 enzymes present in humans , indicating that there is a huge number of targets for the ubiquitin proteasome system .",

  "Before the present Junagarh Fort was built , an old stone fort existed in the city . This fort was built in 1478 by Rao Bika who established the city of Bikaner in 1472 . Rao Bika was the second son of Maharaja Rao Jodha of the Rathor clan , the founder of Jodhpur city . He conquered the large arid lands to the northern region of Rajasthan to set up his domain . As the second son of Jodha he had no chance of inheriting his father ’ s territory of Jodhpur or to the title of Maharaja . He , therefore , reconciled and decided to build his own kingdom at Bikaner at the place then called \" Jungladesh \" . Bikaner , though a partly of the Thar Desert , was considered an oasis on the trade route between Central Asia and the Gujarat coast since it had adequate spring water sources . Bika ’ s name was thus tagged to the Bikaner city as well as to the then state of Bikaner ( “ the settlement of Bika ” ) that he established . The history of Bikaner and the fort within it thus start with Bika . It was only about 100 years later that Bikaner ’ s fortunes flourished under Raja Rai Singhji , the sixth ruler of Bikaner , who ruled from 1571 to 1611 . During the Mughal Empire ’ s rule in the country , he accepted the suzerainty of the Mughals and held a high position of an army general in the court of Emperor Akbar and his son Emperor Jahangir . His successful war exploits by way of winning half of Mewar kingdom won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors . He was gifted the jagirs ( lands ) of Gujarat and Burhanpur . With the large revenue earned from these jagirs , he built the Junagarh fort on a plain land , which has an average elevation of 760 feet ( 230 m ) . The formal foundation ceremony for the fort was held on 17 February 1589 and the fort was completed on 17 January 1594 . Raja Rai Singhji , was an expert in arts and architecture and the knowledge that he acquired during his several sojourns to several countries are amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built in the Junagarh fort . Thus the fort , a composite structure , became an outstanding example of architecture and a unique centre of art , amidst the Thar desert .",

Faulting in the area is strike @-@ slip @-@ oriented probably because of the Alabama @-@ New York Lineament , which runs adjacent to the fault . Several scientists believe that the small earthquakes from the zone highlight the reactivation of deep , ancient faults . Alabama has seen roughly 20 earthquakes since the beginning of the 20th century . The earthquakes have been moderate , never reaching above magnitude 5 @.@ 1 , and tend to cause damage only near their epicenters while reaching areas much further away . Major events include those in 1916 , 1997 , and 2003 . Despite the lack of powerful seismic events in Alabama , earthquakes from nearby fault zones , including the New Madrid Seismic Zone , pose a serious threat to infrastructure . Even an earthquake similar in size to the 1916 Irondale event today could damage thousands of buildings and cause up to $ 1 billion in damage .",

  "Following this appeal , the Allies also beached their ships , and began to prepare to assault the camp . The Persians , guessing that their Samian contingent would support the allies , took away their armour . Furthermore , they sent the Milesians to guard the passes over Mycale , suspecting that the Milesians might also defect . Thus rid of two potential internal threats , the Persians left their camp , and prepared for battle . It is probable that the relatively small number of marines that the Allies had disembarked for the battle made them overconfident , encouraging the Persians to leave the safety of their camp .",
  "The serious nature of the environmental problems the lake has been experienced has been widely publicised and has been brought to the attention of the Supreme Court of India . Public Interest Litigations ( PILs ) have been filed in court demonstrating the environmental dangers posed to the lake by sewage , wastes and effluents . The PILs have sought injunctions of the court for setting up of an integrated ring sewage system encircling the Lake ; release of funds by the Government of India to undertake measures to check pollution and to inaugurate a High Powered Committee to monitor proper utilisation of the allotted funds . The committee is under obligation to post feedback of progression developments from time to time , directly to the Supreme Court . The PIL , filed in 2001 , has resulted in a number of directives from the court to the funding and implementing agencies and the case is continuing . Consequently , under the National Lake Conservation Plan of the Ministry of Environment and Forests of the Government of India , funds to the extent Rs 2987 @.@ 6 million were sanctioned in September 2005 for the conservation of the lake . The restoration and rehabilitation measures envisaged under the \" Conservation and Management of Dal Lake \" are under various stages of implementation with the funds allocated by the Government of India for the purpose . Some of the measures undertaken for rehabilitating the lake to bring it to its original eutrophication free status involved measures such as construction of siltation tanks , mechanical deweeding , regrouping of houseboats , deepening of outflow channel and removal of bunds and barricades , including some floating gardens . In addition , a moratorium has been imposed on new construction works close to the lakefront , including the building of new house boats .

  "Physically , American kestrels are leaner and less muscular than larger falcons .

  "The Raja Veda Padasala , established by Govinda Dikshitar during 1542 in Kumbakonam , teaches Sanskrit vedic scriptures in specialised fields of Rig Veda , Yajur Veda , Sama Veda , Agamas and Sastras . Kumbakonam emerged as an important centre of education in the late 19th century and was known as the \" Cambridge of South India \" . The Government Arts College , established in Kumbakonam in 1867 , is one of the oldest educational institutions in the Madras Presidency . It began as a provincial school on October 19 , 1854 , before being upgraded to a government college in 1867 . It was affiliated to the Madras University in 1877 . One of the early principals of the college was William Archer Porter , a Cambridge Wrangler , who , along with T. Gopala Rao , was instrumental in its elevation to a government college . He is also credited with framing the college 's acclaimed educational policy . In 1881 , it became a full @-@ fledged college and high school courses ceased to be taught . Notable faculty members included U. V. Swaminatha Iyer ( 1855 – 1942 ) while the Indian mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan ( 1887 – 1920 ) who studied from 1904 until 1906 when he dropped out and V.

  "Modern historians of this period , such as Hans @-@ Jürgen Lüsebrink , Simon Schama and Monique Cottret , concur that the actual treatment of prisoners in Bastille was much better than the public impression left through these writings . Nonetheless , fuelled by the secrecy that still surrounded the Bastille , official as well as public concern about the prison and the system that supported it also began to mount , prompting reforms . As early as 1775 , Louis XVI 's minister Malesherbes had authorised all prisoners to be given newspapers to read , and to be allowed to write and to correspond with their family and friends . In the 1780s Breteuil , the Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi , began a substantial reform of the system of lettres de cachet that sent prisoners to the Bastille : lettres were now required to list the length of time a prisoner would be detained for , and the offence for which they were being held .",

  "While patterns can provide more effective crypsis than solid colour when the camouflaged object is stationary , any pattern , particularly one with high contrast , stands out when the object is moving .

After the war , most nations returned to a unicoloured uniform for their troops . Some nations , notably Austria and Israel , continue to use solid colour combat uniforms today . Similarly , while larger military aircraft traditionally had a disruptive pattern with a darker top over a lighter lower surface ( a form of countershading ) , modern fast fighter aircraft often wear gray overall .",

  "Three main factors determine the quality of preserved material in a coal ball : the mineral constituents , the speed of the burial process , and the degree of compression before undergoing permineralisation . Generally , coal balls resulting from remains that have a quick burial with little decay and pressure are better preserved , although plant remains in most coal balls almost always show differing signs of decay and collapse . Coal balls containing quantities of iron sulfide have far lower preservation than coal balls permineralised by magnesium or calcium carbonate , which has earned iron sulfide the title \" chief curse of the coal ball hunter \" .",

  "Surface currents only affect the top few hundred meters ( yards ) of the sea , but there are also large @-@ scale flows in the ocean depths caused by the movement of deep water masses . A main deep ocean current flows through all the world 's oceans and is known as the thermohaline circulation or global conveyor belt . This movement is slow and is driven by differences in density of the water caused by variations in salinity and temperature . At high latitudes , the water is chilled by the low atmospheric temperature and becomes saltier as sea ice crystallizes out . Both these factors make it denser and the water sinks . From the deep sea near Greenland , such water flows southwards between the continental landmasses on either side of the Atlantic . When it reaches the Antarctic , it is joined by further masses of cold , sinking water and flows eastwards . It then splits into two streams that move northwards into the Indian and Pacific Oceans . Here it is gradually warmed , becomes less dense , rises towards the surface , and loops back on itself . Some flows back into the Atlantic . It takes a thousand years for this circulation pattern to be completed .",

  "Although these traits are shared among both living and extinct lemurs , they are uncommon among primates in general . Two prevailing hypotheses to explain these unique adaptations are the energy frugality hypothesis by Patricia Wright ( 1999 ) and the evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis by Carel van Schaik and Peter M. Kappeler ( 1996 ) . The energy frugality hypothesis expanded on Alison Jolly 's energy conservation hypotheses by claiming that most lemur traits not only help conserve energy , but also maximize the use of highly limited resources , enabling them to live in severely seasonal environments with low productivity . The evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis postulated that living lemurs are in the process of evolving to fill open ecological niches left by the recently extinct subfossil lemurs . For example , small nocturnal prosimians are typically nocturnal and monogamous , while the larger living lemurs are generally active both day and night ( cathemeral ) and live in small groups ( gregarious ) . Cathemerality and increased gregariousness might indicate that the larger living lemurs are evolving to fill the role of the giant lemurs , which were thought to be diurnal ( day @-@ living ) and more monkey @-@ like in behavior . Since most giant subfossil lemurs have been shown to share many of the unique traits of their living counterparts , and not those of monkeys , Godfrey et al .

Many English seaside resorts built piers in the 1850s to attract tourists . At Clevedon tourism grew following the opening of a branch line from Yatton railway station which connected it to the Bristol to Exeter Line , enabling travel from the rest of the country .

Still , Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring 's size , its angle relative to Earth , its red colour , and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun . The ring system was definitively discovered on March 10 , 1977 by James L. Elliot , Edward W. Dunham , and Jessica Mink using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory . The discovery was serendipitous ; they planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 ( also known as HD 128598 ) by Uranus to study its atmosphere . When their observations were analysed , they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus . They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus . Later they detected four additional rings . The rings were directly imaged when Voyager 2 passed Uranus in 1986 . Voyager 2 also discovered two additional faint rings , bringing the total number to eleven .",

  "The city was defended in medieval times by Bristol Castle , a Norman fortification built on the site of a wooden predecessor . The castle played a key role in the civil wars that followed the death of Henry I. Stephen of Blois reconnoitred Bristol in 1138 and claimed that the town was impregnable . After Stephen 's capture , in 1141 , he was imprisoned in the castle . The castle was later taken into royal hands , and Henry III spent lavishly on it , adding a barbican before the main west gate , a gate tower , and a magnificent hall . By the 16th century , the castle had fallen into disuse , but the city authorities had no control over royal property , and so the castle became a refuge for lawbreakers . In 1630 , the city purchased the castle ; Oliver Cromwell ordered its destruction in 1656 . An area outside the castle , known as Old Market , was used as a mustering point for troops . It later became a market for the country people to set up stalls and sell their wares . Old Market was also the site of an autumn fair . The market may have existed as early as the 12th century , and was the site of the first suburb outside the city walls . It had side roads which could accommodate the traffic on market days .",

  "Another of Przybylo 's articles , Asexuality and the feminist politics of ' not doing it ' , was published in 2011 , and takes a feminist lens to scientific writings on asexuality . She argues that asexuality is made possible only through the Western context of \" sexual , coital , and heterosexual imperatives \" . She addresses earlier works by Dana Densmore , Valerie Solanas , and Breanne Fahs , who argued for \" asexuality and celibacy \" as radical feminist political strategies against patriarchy . While Przybylo does make some distinctions between asexuality and celibacy , she considers blurring the lines between the two to be productive for a feminist understanding of the topic . In 2013 , \" Producing Facts : Empirical Asexuality and the Scientific Study of Sex . \" was published in Feminism & Psychology . In it , Przybylo distinguishes between two different stages of asexual research - that of the late 1970s to the early 1990s , which often included a very limited understanding of asexuality , and the more recent revisiting of the subject which she says began with Bogaert 's 2004 study ( see above ) and has popularized the subject and made it more \" culturally visible \" . In this article , Przybylo once again asserts the understanding of asexuality as a cultural phenomenon , and continues to be critical of its scientific study .",

  "This brings the issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture , and why it so immediately replaced the Oksywie culture . According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes , the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia ( under King Berig ) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores , followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids . Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region , and then , some years later ( under King Filimer , the fifth one counting from Berig ) , continued their migration toward the Black Sea . This story , in the past dismissed , is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed . The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different ( although related ) people , who mixed with the Oksywie culture population , and being more advanced possibly dominated it ( at least culturally ) to some degree , is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD .",

  "According to Registro Oficial No. 1272 , a decree signed into law on 5 December 1900 , there are two official designs of the national flag . Article Two established the national banner as the tricolor with the yellow stripe doubling the size of the blue and red stripes . Article Three establishes the national flag charged with the coat of arms and is directed to be used by the military , government offices and diplomatic agents outside of Ecuador . While this law establishes the flag with the coat of arms as the state flag , it did not forbid the civilian population from using the flag . The only restriction is stated in Article Six where the merchant marine is restricted to using the flag without the coat of arms . Because of this , this has been construed to be the civil flag as it was practiced in other South American countries , such as Peru , Bolivia and Argentina . Unlike Ecuador , several of these South American countries forbade the civilian population from using the national flag with the coat of arms or , in the case of Argentina until 1985 , the national flag charged with the Sun of May in the middle . Peru and Bolivia still restricts the usage of the state flag to just the government bodies and institutions and reserves the plain flags for national celebrations or as directed by law . However , in practice the flag with the coat of arms is often used in place of the plain flag , especially when it is important to distinguish the latter from the flag of Colombia . In the case when Colombian merchant marine ships are at sea , the Colombian national flag is charged with a red and blue oval with a white star in the center . For city governments , Article 4 in the 1900 decree forbids them from using the national flag with the coat of arms . A special flag was created for the city governments to use ; it is a plain national flag charged with white stars that are placed in a circle pattern . The number of white stars will correspond to the number of provinces in Ecuador . However , this flag is identical to Venezuela 's flag from 1905 until 1930 , and similar to Venezuela 's current flag ( the stars are now in a semi circle pattern ) .",

Shortly thereafter the wartime direction of trade began when the British asked the Australian government to place certain restrictions upon overseas trade in order to secure resources vital to the war effort and to limit the ability of the Central Powers from obtaining these goods from Commonwealth nations via neutral third parties . To an extent these restrictions served to reduce the ability of Australian producers to find buyers for their products , at least initially , however , in many cases the British stepped in to buy these goods , thus alleviating Australian concerns about a significant reduction in the standard of living .

  "Anamorphic or imperfect fungi are those that seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle , and typically reproduce by the process of mitosis in structures called conidia . In some cases , the sexual stage — or teleomorph stage — is later identified , and a teleomorph @-@ anamorph relationship is established between the species . The International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants permits the recognition of two ( or more ) names for one and the same organism , one based on the teleomorph , the other ( s ) restricted to the anamorph . The name of the anamorphic state of S. coccinea is Molliardiomyces eucoccinea , first described by Marin Molliard in 1904 . Molliard found the growth of the conidia to resemble those of the genera Coryne and Chlorosplenium rather than the Pezizaceae , and he considered that this suggested an affinity between Sarcoscypha and the family Helvellaceae . In 1972 , John W. Paden again described the anamorph , but like Molliard , failed to give a complete description of the species . In 1984 , Paden created a new genus he named Molliardiomyces to contain the anamorphic forms of several Sarcoscypha species , and set Molliardiomyces eucoccinea as the type species . This form produces colorless conidiophores ( specialized stalks that bear conidia ) that are usually irregularly branched , measuring 30 – 110 by 3 @.@ 2 – 4 @.@ 7 µm .

  "From the 17th century onwards , some keeps were deliberately destroyed . In England , many were destroyed after the end of the Second English Civil War in 1649 , when Parliament took steps to prevent another royalist uprising by slighting , or damaging , castles so as to prevent them from having any further military utility . Slighting was quite expensive and took considerable effort to carry out , so damage was usually done in the most cost efficient fashion with only selected walls being destroyed . Keeps were singled out for particular attention in this process because of their continuing political and cultural importance , and the prestige they lent their former royalist owners – at Kenilworth , for example , only the keep was slighted , and at Raglan , the keep was the main focus of parliamentary activity . There was some equivalent destruction of keeps in France in the 17th and 18th centuries , such as the slighting of Montaiguillon by Cardinal Richelieu in 1624 , but the catalogue of damage was far less than that of the 1640s and early 1650s in England .",

  "Gandhi 's reaction to the Lahore Resolution was muted ; he called it \" baffling \" , but told his disciples that Muslims , in common with other people of India , had the right to self @-@ determination . Leaders of the Congress were more vocal ; Jawaharlal Nehru referred to Lahore as \" Jinnah 's fantastic proposals \" while Chakravarti Rajagopalachari deemed Jinnah 's views on partition \" a sign of a diseased mentality \" . Linlithgow met with Jinnah in June 1940 , soon after Winston Churchill became the British prime minister , and in August offered both the Congress and the League a deal whereby in exchange for full support for the war , Linlithgow would allow Indian representation on his major war councils . The Viceroy promised a representative body after the war to determine India 's future , and that no future settlement would be imposed over the objections of a large part of the population . This was satisfactory to neither the Congress nor the League , though Jinnah was pleased that the British had moved towards recognising Jinnah as the representative of the Muslim community 's interests . Jinnah was reluctant to make specific proposals as to the boundaries of Pakistan , or its relationships with Britain and with the rest of the subcontinent , fearing that any precise plan would divide the League .",

This view was explored during the 1970s rise of feminist literary criticism . Although abridged editions of Austen 's novels had been published in the United States since 1832 , a distinct American response to Austen was not heard before 1870 . According to Southam , \" For American literary nationalists Jane Austen 's cultivated scene was too pallid , too constrained , too refined , too downright unheroic \" . Austen was not a democratic author , and her canvas did not extend to the frontier themes which had come to define American literature . By the turn of the 20th century , the American response was represented by a debate between American novelist and critic William Dean Howells and writer and humourist Mark Twain . In a series of essays , Howells painted Austen as a canonical popular figure ; Twain used her as an argument against anglophilia , demonstrating the distinctiveness of American literature by disparaging that from England . In his book , Following the Equator , Twain described his ship 's library : \" Jane Austen 's books ... are absent from this library . Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn 't a book in it . \"",

Airstrikes began on 30 August , initially targeting VRS air defences , and striking targets near Sarajevo . The campaign was briefly suspended on 1 September and its scope was expanded to target artillery and storage facilities around the city . The bombing resumed on 5 September , and its scope extended to VRS air defences near Banja Luka by 9 September as NATO had nearly exhausted its list of targets near Sarajevo . On 13 September , the Bosnian Serbs accepted NATO 's demand for the establishment of an exclusion zone around Sarajevo and the campaign ceased .",
  "In December 2001 , a Fox News report raised the concern that wiretapping equipment provided by Comverse Infosys to the U.S. government for electronic eavesdropping may have been vulnerable , as these systems allegedly had a back door through which the wiretaps could be intercepted by unauthorized parties . Fox News reporter Carl Cameron said there was no reason to believe the Israeli government was implicated , but that \" a classified top @-@ secret investigation is underway \" . A March 2002 story by Le Monde recapped the Fox report and concluded : \" Comverse is suspected of having introduced into its systems of the ' catch gates ' in order to ' intercept , record and store ' these wire @-@ taps .

While no real evidence has been presented against Comverse or Verint , the allegations have become a favorite topic of conspiracy theorists .",
  "In September 1968 Caetano Veloso gave two tumultuous performances at the third annual International Popular Song Festival in Rio , where the audience included a large contingent of left @-@ wing students who were vehemently opposed to the Tropicalistas . When Veloso ( backed by Os Mutantes ) performed in the first round of the Festival 's song competition on 12 September , he was initially greeted with enthusiastic applause , but the situation soon turned ugly . Dressed in a shiny green plastic suit , festooned with wires and necklaces strung with teeth , Veloso provoked the students with his sensual movements and startling new psychedelic music . He was bombarded by insults , jeers and boos from the students , who became even more incensed when American pop singer John Dandurand made a surprise appearance during the song . The ideological conflict climaxed three days later when Veloso returned for the second round of the competition on 15 September , at which he performed a new song entitled \" Prohibido a Prohibir \" ( \" It is Forbidden to Forbid \" ) , which was recorded live and later released as single .",

  "\" Lovebird \" was written by Bonnie McKee , Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke , and produced by Josh Abrahams , Oligee , and Coleman ( under his production name , Ammo ) . The song was engineered by Ryan Williams , assisted by Daniela Rivera . \" Lovebird \" was mixed by Phil Tan at the Ninja Beat Club in Atlanta , Georgia and mastered by Colin Leonard at SING Mastering using SING Technology , both located in Atlanta . The song was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles . \" Lovebird \" is a power ballad of three minutes and thirty seconds . The song 's musical structure bears strong resemblances to one of Lewis ' previous singles , \" Bleeding Love \" , from her début studio album Spirit ( 2007 ) . The track opens with a piano introduction similar to that on \" Bleeding Love \" , and features an \" instantly hummable chorus \" . Lewis informs her lover in the lyrics – with the lines \" But the time went on , the wind has blown , and I have grown \" – that enough time has passed since their relationship started for her to have developed as a person . As power ballad beats and \" airy synths \" play , she sings \" Your lovebird 's flying away / Cos my heart 's been stuck in a cage \" . The hook consists of Lewis singing \" I 've got to sing my song , so pretty / Dum , dum , diddy \" .",

  "Deimatic displays are made by insects including the praying mantises ( Mantidae ) and stick insects ( Phasmatodea ) . While undisturbed , these insects are usually well camouflaged . When disturbed by a potential predator , they suddenly reveal their hind wings , which are brightly coloured . In mantises , the wing display is sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs , and accompanied by a loud hissing sound created by stridulation . For example , the grasshopper Phymateus displays red and yellow areas on its hind wings ; it is also aposematic , producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax . Similarly the threat display of the walking stick phasmid ( Peruphasma schultei ) is not a bluff : the insect sprays defensive dolichodial @-@ like monoterpene chemical compounds at attackers .",

  "Frame Analysis : An Essay on the Organization of Experience ( 1974 ) is Goffman 's attempt to explain how conceptual frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual 's perception of society . This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society . A frame is a set of concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals , groups and societies . Frame analysis , then , is the study of the organization of social experience . To illustrate the concept of the frame , Goffman gives the example of a picture frame : a person uses the frame ( which represents structure ) to hold together his picture ( which represents the content ) of what he is experiencing in his life .",

  "Chesbro pitched the Highlanders ' first game . He finished the 1903 season with a 21 – 15 record . Chesbro began throwing a spitball in the 1904 season , which he learned from Elmer Stricklett , the inventor of the spitball . Chesbro also began working on a \" slow ball \" . That year , he started 51 games and finished 48 while posting a 1 @.@ 82 ERA , striking out 239 batters , and recording 41 wins and 48 complete games over 454 2 ⁄ 3 innings pitched , setting MLB records for wins , complete games , and innings pitched in a season . That year , no other pitcher in the league won more than 26 . Chesbro won 14 straight games from May 14 through July 4 , a New York franchise record that stood until Roger Clemens broke it in 2001 . His 239 strikeouts remained a team record until Ron Guidry struck out 248 in 1978 . On the last day of the season , in a game against the Boston Americans ( now known as the Boston Red Sox ) , he threw a wild pitch in the top of the ninth inning , allowing the winning run to score from third base and causing the Highlanders to lose the pennant to Boston . The ruling on this play was controversial . Even after Chesbro 's death in 1931 , his widow , with the support of former Highlanders manager Clark Griffith , continued to claim that the pitch was a passed ball , and blamed the winning run on catcher Red Kleinow .",

  "Alfred , by [ c.885 ] in full control of Wessex and at the height of his power , was clearly bent on trying to settle the kingship on his son , Edward , to the exclusion of his brother Æthelred 's heirs . That kingship was never in Alfred 's gift , but clearly the greater amount of landed wealth he could entail on Edward , the stronger he made that son 's position in any future contest for the kingship . We must , therefore , treat anything he tells us of the terms of the disputed inheritance of his rival nephews with the utmost caution , if not scepticism . The support which Alfred tells us he received from the witan counts for little . As king , Alfred controlled immense patronage in relation to his thegns , who stood to benefit from backing their lord against claims which his nephews made on his property . It is significant that the case ever came before the witan at all . That it did , suggests that Æthelhelm and Æthelwold were by then young men who commanded some independent support and sympathy in Wessex .",

  "Cibber 's career as both actor and theatre manager is important in the history of the British stage because he was one of the first in a long and illustrious line of actor @-@ managers that would include such luminaries as Garrick , Henry Irving , and Herbert Beerbohm Tree . Rising from actor at Drury Lane to advisor to the manager Christopher Rich , Cibber worked himself by degrees into a position to take over the company , first taking many of its players — including Thomas Doggett , Robert Wilks , and Anne Oldfield — to form a new company at the Queen 's Theatre in the Haymarket . The three actors squeezed out the previous owners in a series of lengthy and complex manoeuvres , but after Rich 's letters patent were revoked , Cibber , Doggett and Wilks were able to buy the company outright and return to the Theatre Royal by 1711 . After a few stormy years of power @-@ struggle between the prudent Doggett and the extravagant Wilks , Doggett was replaced by the upcoming actor Barton Booth and Cibber became in practice sole manager of Drury Lane . He set a pattern for the line of more charismatic and successful actors that were to succeed him in this combination of roles . His near @-@ contemporary Garrick , as well as the 19th @-@ century actor @-@ managers Irving and Tree , would later structure their careers , writing , and manager identity around their own striking stage personalities . Cibber 's forte as actor @-@ manager was , by contrast , the manager side . He was a clever , innovative , and unscrupulous businessman who retained all his life a love of appearing on the stage . His triumph was that he rose to a position where , in consequence of his sole power over production and casting at Drury Lane , London audiences had to put up with him as an actor . Cibber 's one significant mistake as a theatre manager was to pass over John Gay 's The Beggar 's Opera , which became an outstanding success for John Rich 's theatre at Lincoln 's Inn Fields . When Cibber attempted to mimic Gay 's success with his own ballad @-@ opera — Love in a Riddle ( 1729 ) — it was shouted down by the audience and Cibber cancelled its run .

  "Political realism formed the basis of Kennan 's work as a diplomat and diplomatic historian and remains relevant to the debate over American foreign policy , which since the 19th century has been characterized by a shift from the Founding Fathers ' realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations . According to the realist tradition , security is based on the principle of a balance of power , whereas Wilsonianism ( considered impractical by realists ) relies on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft . According to the Wilsonians the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is important and morals are valid universally . During the Presidency of Bill Clinton , American diplomacy represented the Wilsonian school to such a degree that those in favor of the realism likened President Clinton 's policies to social work . According to Kennan , whose concept of American diplomacy was based on the realist approach , such moralism without regard to the realities of power and the national interest is self @-@ defeating and will result in the decrease of American power .",

In examining populations in southern Queensland , they reported that the two forms were distinct in growth habit and habitat , and that they did not find any intermediate forms . New South Wales botanists Joseph Maiden and Julius Henry Camfield had collected this taller form of B. oblongifolia in Kogarah in 1898 , and given it the name Banksia latifolia variety minor — B. latifolia being a published name by which B. robur was known — before Maiden and Ernst Betche renamed it Banksia robur variety minor .

  "John Harold Wilson argues that the famously virile stage presence of Hart as Horner must be taken into account when interpreting the play . As personified by Hart , Horner will have won women not so much through clever trickery as \" the old @-@ fashioned way \" , by being \" dangerously attractive \" , and it is only fools like Sir Jaspar Fidget who really believe him harmless . Harcourt / Kynaston , although by 1675 a well @-@ regarded and skilful actor of male roles , would clearly have been overshadowed by Horner / Hart . The actresses associated with each hero must also have tended to make the Horner plot more striking on the stage than the true @-@ love plot .

  "Although Stanisław Lem worked with Tarkovsky and Friedrich Gorenstein in developing the screenplay , Lem maintained that he \" never really liked Tarkovsky 's version \" of his novel . Tarkovsky wanted a film story based on the novel but artistically independent of its origin . However , Lem opposed any divergence of the screenplay from the novel . Lem went as far as to say that Tarkovsky made Crime and Punishment rather than Solaris , omitting epistemological and cognitive aspects of his book . Tarkovsky claimed that Lem did not fully appreciate cinema and that he expected the film to merely illustrate the novel without creating an original cinematic piece . Tarkovsky 's film is about the inner lives of its scientists as human beings . Lem 's novel is about the conflicts of man 's condition in nature and the nature of man in the universe . For Tarkovsky , Lem 's exposition of that existential conflict was the starting point for describing the inner lives of the characters .",

  "Despite the Geneva Accord requiring the immediate withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia , the JNA remained there for another seven to eight months .

The 2 January ceasefire allowed the JNA to retain its positions in East and West Slavonia , which were on the brink of military collapse . As a consequence of organizational problems and breaches of the previous ceasefire agreement , the UNPROFOR did not start to arrive until 8 March and took two months to fully deploy in the UNPAs . Even though UNPROFOR had placed most of the RSK 's heavy weapons in storage areas jointly controlled by the UN and the RSK by January 1993 , the peacekeeping troops were unable to fulfil the provisions of the Vance plan , such as the disarmament of the RSK militia , the return of refugees , the restoration of civilian authority and establishment of an ethnically mixed police force . The RSK military was retitled as police while the ethnic cleansing of areas under its control continued unchecked .

To prevent corrosion , Maunsell incorporated a vertical metal cover above the front buffer beam to protect the inside cylinder and valve gear assembly , the main visual difference from the N class . Maunsell and Holcroft anticipated that the standard N class chimney would choke the exhaust blast produced by the three cylinders . To mitigate this , a wider @-@ diameter blastpipe was cast for the locomotive and a new smokebox fabricated to accommodate a wide @-@ diameter cast chimney .

  "Following the first skirmish in Pakrac in March , a predominantly Serb @-@ populated area east of the town , straddling the Pakrac – Bučje – Požega road , remained generally beyond the control of Croatian authorities . In early July , the insurrection spread to the entire area between the towns of Pakrac and Požega and north to the northern slopes of Papuk and Bilogora . This development threatened to interdict the Croatian use of the Varaždin – Osijek road , as it was within range of Croatian Serb artillery near Slatina . After the Serb rebels declared the Serbian Autonomous Oblast of Western Slavonia ( SAO Western Slavonia ) and expanded the territory under their control to include the town of Okučani , the most significant transport route between Zagreb and Slavonia — the Zagreb – Belgrade motorway between Novska and Nova Gradiška — was severed . SAO Western Slavonia comprised no major settlements . In order to address this deficiency , Croatian Serb forces launched an offensive early on 19 August . The objectives of the offensive were to capture the towns of Grubišno Polje , Daruvar , Pakrac and Lipik , and consolidate the territory of SAO Western Slavonia . The offensive failed after the arrival of Croatian reinforcements from Zagreb and Bjelovar , but the line of control remained in close proximity to the four towns .",
  "Sir George Ralph Collier , 1st Baronet KCB ( 1774 – 24 March 1824 ) was an officer of the Royal Navy during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars , and the War of 1812 . He had an eventful early life , being shipwrecked early in his career and later captured by the French . Nevertheless , he saw enough service to attract the attention of powerful patrons that secured his rise through the ranks . An officer of considerable ability , he won a noteworthy victory against a stronger French opponent , before embarking on a period of distinguished service off the Spanish and Portuguese coasts , working closely with the British generals fighting the Peninsular War , and markedly contributing to their success . His good service led to a prime posting in command of a squadron despatched to hunt down and neutralise the American super frigates during the War of 1812 . He came close to capturing the USS Constitution , but lost her in circumstances that were unclear and would later return to haunt him . The years of peace that followed the end of the Napoleonic Wars saw him rewarded with a baronetcy , and his continued to serve in the navy where he was tasked with the suppression of the slave trade . The publishing of William James 's account of the War of 1812 , which lambasted him for incompetence and cowardice in his failure to catch the Constitution , broke his personal peace . Having failed to clear his name , and increasingly depressed by the accusations , Collier took his own life .",

  "In certain situations , law enforcement may perform a search when they have a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity , even if it falls short of probable cause necessary for an arrest . Under Terry v. Ohio ( 1968 ) , law enforcement officers are permitted to conduct a limited warrantless search on a level of suspicion less than probable cause under certain circumstances .

Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [ Stanford 's ] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral , the better for his musical reputation . \" The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884 , three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden .

And I do think that there might be more tune . Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely . \" In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had \" just such a ' book ' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier . He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera .

  "Santiago , rather than listening to popular radio , borrowed rock and roll records from the public library as he was growing up ; he first discovered Les Paul and Jimi Hendrix , who led to jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery . Santiago later commented on Montgomery 's influence : \" And that 's when I said , ' Ah , that 's a hook . That 's some hooky stuff in the jazz world ' \" . He discovered jazz and country artists such as Joe Pass and Chet Atkins after studying the liner notes of albums . Santiago was directly influenced by the \" Hendrix chord \" , the sharp 9th dominant chord which , in the words of author Ben Sisario , \" tapped a hidden rage that matched the horror of Thompson 's scream \" . As a teenager , Santiago also listened to classic rock and protopunk artists such as The Who , The Rolling Stones , The Velvet Underground and Iggy Pop .",

  "Helium as a breathing gas has no narcotic properties , so helium mixtures such as trimix , heliox and heliair are used for deep diving to reduce the effects of narcosis , which worsen with increasing depth . As pressure increases with depth , the density of the breathing gas also increases , and the low molecular weight of helium is found to considerably reduce the effort of breathing by lowering the density of the mixture . This reduces the Reynolds number of flow , leading to a reduction of turbulent flow and an increase in laminar flow , which requires less work of breathing . At depths below 150 metres ( 490 ft ) divers breathing helium – oxygen mixtures begin to experience tremors and a decrease in psychomotor function , symptoms of high @-@ pressure nervous syndrome . This effect may be countered to some extent by adding an amount of narcotic gas such as hydrogen or nitrogen to a helium – oxygen mixture .",
  "In a letter to Vera Zasulich dated 8 March 1881 , Marx contemplated the possibility of Russia 's bypassing the capitalist stage of development and building communism on the basis of the common ownership of land characteristic of the village mir . While admitting that Russia 's rural \" commune is the fulcrum of social regeneration in Russia \" , Marx also warned that , in order for the mir to operate as a means for moving straight to the socialist stage without a preceding capitalist stage , it \" would first be necessary to eliminate the deleterious influences which are assailing it ( the rural commune ) from all sides \" . Given the elimination of these pernicious influences , Marx allowed that \" normal conditions of spontaneous development \" of the rural commune could exist . However , in the same letter to Vera Zasulich , Marx points out that \" at the core of the capitalist system ... lies the complete separation of the producer from the means of production . \" In one of the drafts of this letter , Marx reveals his growing passion for anthropology , motivated by his belief that future communism would be a return on a higher level to the communism of our prehistoric past . He wrote that \" the historical trend of our age is the fatal crisis which capitalist production has undergone in the European and American countries where it has reached its highest peak , a crisis that will end in its destruction , in the return of modern society to a higher form of the most archaic type — collective production and appropriation \" . He added that \" the vitality of primitive communities was incomparably greater than that of Semitic , Greek , Roman , etc. societies , and , a fortiori , that of modern capitalist societies \" . Before he died , Marx asked Engels to write up these ideas , which were published in 1884 under the title The Origin of the Family , Private Property and the State .",

  "Males reach sexual maturity at 3 – 5 weeks ; females can be fertile as early as four weeks and can carry litters before they are adults . Females that have never given birth may develop irreversible fusing of the pubic symphysis , a joint in the pelvis , due to calcification which may occur between six and 10 months of age . If they become pregnant after this has happened , the birth canal will not widen sufficiently ; this may lead to dystocia and death as they attempt to give birth . Calcification of the female 's pubic symphysis ( if not bred ) is a common myth . The reason for potential calcification is a metabolic disease , like ochronosis . A healthy , normal female guinea pig 's pubic symphysis does not calcify . Females can become pregnant 6 – 48 hours after giving birth , but it is not healthy for a female to be thus constantly pregnant .",
  "For galaxies more distant than the Local Group and the nearby Virgo Cluster , but within a thousand megaparsecs or so , the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy 's distance . This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and has come to be known as Hubble 's law . Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts , in about the year 1912 , while Hubble correlated Slipher 's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law . In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity , redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space : this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us , the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy , so the more the light has been stretched , the more redshifted the light is , and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us . Hubble 's law follows in part from the Copernican principle . Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are , measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements , so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble 's law .",

  "The badnjak ( Cyrillic : бадњак , Serbian pronunciation : [ bǎdɲaːk ] ) , also called veseljak ( весељак , [ ʋɛˈsɛ ̌ ʎaːk ] , literally \" jovial one \" in Serbian ) , is a log brought into the house and placed on the fire on the evening of Christmas Eve , a central tradition in Serbian Christmas celebrations much like a yule log in other European traditions . The tree from which the badnjak is cut , preferably a young and straight oak , is ceremonially felled early on the morning of Christmas Eve . The felling , preparation , bringing in , and laying on the fire , are surrounded by elaborate rituals , with many regional variations . The burning of the log is accompanied by prayers that the coming year brings food , happiness , love , luck , and riches . The log burns on throughout Christmas Day , when the first visitor strikes it with a poker or a branch to make sparks fly , while wishing that the family 's happiness and prosperity be as abundant as the sparks . As most Serbs today live in towns and cities , the badnjak is often symbolically represented by a cluster of oak twigs with brown leaves attached , with which the home is decorated on Christmas Eve .",

The style uses a complex system of metaphors that are often very closely tied to the land , flora and culture of the particular writer , especially in the case of Roa Bastos . Magic realism is a Neobaroque concept that applies such systems of metaphor to otherwise realistic settings ( Yo , el Supremo being a notable example of the form ) . The Neobaroque style was used by many Paraguayan writers in exile after 1947 and until the 1980s . At the core of much of the work from this group are ideas of political freedom and the emancipation of their homeland .",

  "The Cunningham – Rawnsley team used the AI specifically to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy . Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner , it was difficult to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape . Usually the blackness of the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter . As they approached , the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous ; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim . Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream . The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first , which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully . Bob Braham , a rival night fighter ace , also used this tactic .",

  "The prospect of a Gore candidacy arose again between 2006 and early 2008 in light of the upcoming 2008 presidential election . Although Gore frequently stated that he had \" no plans to run \" , he did not reject the possibility of future involvement in politics which led to speculation that he might run . This was due in part to his increased popularity after the release of the 2006 documentary , An Inconvenient Truth . The director of the film , Davis Guggenheim , stated that after the release of the film , \" Everywhere I go with him , they treat him like a rock star . \" After An Inconvenient Truth was nominated for an Academy Award , Donna Brazile ( Gore 's campaign chairwoman from his 2000 campaign ) speculated that Gore might announce a possible presidential candidacy during the Oscars . During the 79th Academy Awards ceremony , Gore and actor Leonardo DiCaprio shared the stage to speak about the \" greening \" of the ceremony itself . Gore began to give a speech that appeared to be leading up to an announcement that he would run for president . However , background music drowned him out and he was escorted offstage , implying that it was a rehearsed gag , which he later acknowledged . After An Inconvenient Truth won the Academy Award for Best Documentary , speculation increased about a possible presidential run . Gore 's popularity was indicated in polls which showed that even without running , he was coming in second or third among possible Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , and John Edwards . Grassroots draft campaigns also developed with the hope that they could encourage Gore to run . Gore , however , remained firm in his decision and declined to run for the presidency .",
  "Fruit bodies were first collected in Austin , Texas , and the species was named Urnula geaster in 1893 ; later it was found in Kyushu in 1937 , but the mushroom was not reported again in Japan until 1973 . Although the new genus Chorioactis was proposed to accommodate the unique species a few years after its original discovery , it was not until 1968 that it was accepted as a valid genus . Its classification has also been a source of confusion . Historically , Chorioactis was placed in the fungus family Sarcosomataceae , despite inconsistencies in the microscopic structure of the ascus , the saclike structure in which spores are formed . Phylogenetic analyses of the past decade have clarified the fungus 's classification : Chorioactis , along with three other genera , make up the family Chorioactidaceae , a grouping of related fungi formally acknowledged in 2008 . In 2009 , Japanese researchers reported discovering a form of the fungus missing the sexual stage of its life cycle ; this asexual state was named Kumanasamuha geaster .",

  "Wellek and Warren write that the relationship between literature and other forms of art , such as architecture , sculpture , music , or visual art , is \" highly various and complex \" . For example , literature may inspire the other art forms , or vice versa . A work of literature may also attempt to have the same effect as another art , through visualization , musicality , or other techniques . However , literature remains a separate art form , and effects found within are conveyed imperfectly . The emotions triggered by a work , or the intentions or theories behind it , will likewise not completely parallel those of another art form ; individual forms of art have also \" evolved \" differently . Instead , Wellek and Warren suggest that works of art , like literature , can only be truly understood by looking at the works of art themselves and not their extrinsic aspects . A comparison between literature and another art form , thus , is secondary to establishing \" outlines of strictly literary evolution \" .",

  "A large quantity of funerary urns have been excavated from the bases of buildings ; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns .

  "Like the video , Campbell noted the song for merging disparate and contradictory musical features in it . He found that the simple melody of \" Like a Prayer \" offered an easy listen , as the contrasts in sound , rhythm and texture appealed to different target audiences . He also believed that the usage of choir and organ paved the way for gospel music to be more mainstream than before . In 1999 , the University of Michigan School of Music , Theatre & Dance held a seminar on the different implications and metaphors present in the song ; it was headed by professors Martin Katz , George Shirley and Michael Daugherty . The main topic discussed was the fact that there can be different metaphorical meanings of the song , as the word \" like \" can be taken in separate contexts . Shirley explained that although when one thinks of \" Like a Prayer \" , they would first think of its visual aspects , but for him the lyrics are far more important as they reinforce the postmodern nature of the video . The ambiguity of the word \" like \" blurs distinctions between a human lover and God , evident strongly in the line \" Like a child , you whisper softly to me \" . This was further explained by Katz , who added : \" The music of ' Like a Prayer ' is probably a mitigating one , blunting and softening the harder edges , the more challenging content of the lyrics and the video . \"",

  "By the time Rainier learned of the outbreak of war , Linois was already at Isle de France , where his ships had arrived without incident on 16 August . Decaen was installed as governor and some of the troops disembarked to reinforce the garrison , although Linois retained the rest on board his squadron . On the journey to India , Linois and Decaen had fallen out , and the effects of their distaste for one another would be a repeated feature of the following campaign . Britain 's declaration of war reached Isle de France at the end of August aboard the corvette Berceau , which Linois added to his squadron . By 8 October his preparations were complete , and the French admiral issued his orders for his squadron to sail . Atalante was detached to raid shipping in the area of Muscat , an important Portuguese trading post . The rest of the squadron , except the troopships , was to sail with Linois to Réunion ( soon to be renamed Île Bonaparte ) , where the garrison was reinforced . It then sailed eastwards to the Dutch East Indies , diverting to raid British shipping lanes , where many merchant ships were still unaware of the outbreak of war . Linois 's first combat cruise was successful , and he captured a number of undefended prizes from the country ships encountered en route to the East Indies . In early December , shortly before he reached Batavia on Java , Linois stopped at the minor British trading town of Bencoolen . The local maritime pilot believed the squadron to be British and brought them into the harbour , anchoring them just outside the range of the port 's defensive battery but within range of the small merchant ships clustered in the bay . These merchant ships recognised the French warships and fled , pursued closely by Berceau and Sémillante . Six were scuttled by their crews at Sellebar 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the south and two more burnt by French landing parties after grounding . The French also destroyed three large warehouses containing cargoes of spices , rice and opium and captured three ships , losing two men killed when a cannon shot from the shore struck Sémillante . On 10 December the squadron arrived at Batavia for the winter , disembarking the remaining soldiers to augment the Dutch garrison .",

  "Although several key elements of Evans 's designs — such as bucket elevators and Archimedean screws — were merely modified rather than invented by him , the combination of many machines into an automated and continuous production line was a unique idea that would prove pivotal to both the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production . Scientific and technical historians now generally credit Evans as the first in a line of industrialists that culminated with Henry Ford and the modern assembly line . His concept of industrial automation was far ahead of its time , and the paradigm shift within manufacturing towards that concept would take more than a century to be fully realized . However continuous process manufacturing would spread from Evans 's milling designs , first to related industries such as brewing and baking , then eventually to a wide variety of products , as technology and prevailing opinion caught up .

The US would still have the airborne alert force and its own small ICBM fleet , but the USSR would have its entire bomber fleet and any missiles they did not launch , leaving them with a massive strategic advantage . To ensure this could not happen , the Report called for the installation of active defenses at SAC bases , Hercules in the short term and an ABM for the 1959 period , along with new early warning radars for ballistic missiles to allow alert aircraft to get away before the missiles hit . Even Zeus would come too late to cover this period , and some consideration was given to an adapted Hercules or a land based version of the Navy 's RIM @-@ 8 Talos as an interim ABM .",
