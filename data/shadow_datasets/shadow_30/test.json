  "Several factors converged to make possible a twenty @-@ cent piece in the 1870s . The first was a shortage of small change in the far West , where base @-@ metal coins did not circulate . Government payments in silver and gold had been suspended during the economic chaos caused by the civil war — coins containing precious metal were hoarded except on the Pacific Coast , and did not pass at face value in trade . Although the base @-@ metal nickel was not widely accepted in the far West , the silver half dime had been struck in increasing numbers at the San Francisco Mint until the silver coin , which did not circulate in the East , was abolished by Congress in 1873 . A shortage of small change resulted , especially as half dimes were used in the jewelry trade ; customers complained they could not get full change for an item costing ten cents for which they paid with a quarter . Prices in the West were sometimes in bits ( 121 ⁄ 2 cents , based on the old Spanish colonial real , although those pieces no longer circulated ) , adding to the change problem . Numismatist David Lange states that a shipment of nickels out West could have solved everything , but that they might not have been accepted due to the prejudice against money which did not contain precious metal .",

Section 28 states the default position is that trustees are entitled to remuneration if it says so in the trust instrument or if a trustee acts in a \" professional capacity \" . A trust can differ from this default , but the Act confirms the recent developments in the common law from the old default position that trustees were entitled to nothing unless it was explicitly stated that they were . Section 29 goes on to say that non @-@ charitable professional trustees are entitled to \" reasonable remuneration \" which will be a sum that the court thinks is comensurate to the work done , along the principles of quantum meruit . This is automatic if the trustee is a corporation , but will require consent of all other trustees if the trustees are natural persons . Section 30 stipulates that rules on charitable trustee remuneration are to be found in a statutory instrument drawn up by the Secretary of State . Trustees will be reimbursed from the trust fund itself , as will be authorised agents , nominees and custodians who are properly appointed by the trustees all so long as the expenses and payable remuneration are incurred while conducting the affairs of the trust .",

  "The period did lead to some reform of internal Society statutes , such as in 1823 and 1831 . The most important change there was the requirement that the Treasurer publish an annual report , along with a copy of the total income and expenditure of the Society . These were to be sent to Fellows at least 14 days before the general meeting , with the intent being to ensure the election of competent Officers by making it readily apparent what existing Officers were doing . This was accompanied by a full list of Fellows standing for Council positions , where previously the names had only been announced a couple of days before .

  "In late 1899 , MacLaren joined a private cricket tour of America and Canada organised by the cricket @-@ playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji . The following March , he was appointed as an assistant secretary at Lancashire . The position was a sinecure ; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket , despite his amateur status . Surviving records do not indicate his salary , but some sources suggest he was paid comfortably more than Lancashire 's leading professionals . In addition , MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express , reporting on matches in which he played , a common practice at the time for amateurs . Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side , and freed from his teaching responsibilities , MacLaren played from the beginning of the 1900 season , planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship . His batting form suffered initially , but the team dominated the start of the season . Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren 's captaincy . However , he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game , when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win . In the latter stages of the season , MacLaren scored prolifically , making a succession of high scores at rapid pace . He ended the 1900 season with 1 @,@ 554 runs at 36 @.@ 13 . During that season , the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no @-@ balled for throwing , but MacLaren defended him in the press . At a meeting of county captains in December , MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold 's bowling action , and in 1901 , Mold was again no @-@ balled and his career was effectively over . MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901 , and his batting form suffered . He frequently dropped low in the batting order , and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly . His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful , and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford 's pitch . In total , he scored 1 @,@ 069 first @-@ class runs at 31 @.@ 44 .",

  "Around 820 Coenwulf forced Wulfred into an unfavourable settlement by which Wulfred gained control over the debated monasteries in exchange for a large payment of gold and the loss of a very large estate to the king . Nor did Coenwulf and his followers quickly cede control of Minster and Reculver to the archbishop . In September 822 , Wulfred reached a settlement with Coenwulf 's successor Ceolwulf signified by the consecration of Ceolwulf as king , which had been delayed about a year because of the dispute with the archbishop . After Ceolwuf 's deposition in 823 Wulfred 's situation improved . The new Mercian king , Beornwulf , presided over another council at Clofesho in 825 where the conflict was finally settled in Wulfred 's favour and an account of the whole conflict up to that point was written down . Coenwulf 's daughter Cwenthryth , abbess of Winchcombe and Minster , paid compensation to Wulfred and lost control over the houses in Kent . Later in 825 ( or possibly the following year ) , however , Kent was lost to Mercia after Egbert of Wessex defeated Beornwulf at Ellendun . Relations between Wulfred and the new West Saxon rulers were cold , and coinage in Wulfred 's name appears to have ceased for a time , though it had been restored before Wulfred 's death in 832 .

  "The thermal efficiency of geothermal electric plants is low , around 10 – 23 % , because geothermal fluids do not reach the high temperatures of steam from boilers . The laws of thermodynamics limits the efficiency of heat engines in extracting useful energy . Exhaust heat is wasted , unless it can be used directly and locally , for example in greenhouses , timber mills , and district heating . System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel , but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant . In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume , electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles . Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy , unlike , for example , wind or solar , its capacity factor can be quite large – up to 96 % has been demonstrated .

  "People whose PTE does not respond to medication may undergo surgery to remove the epileptogenic focus , the part of the brain that is causing the seizures . However surgery for PTE may be more difficult than it is for epilepsy due to other causes , and is less likely to be helpful in PTE than in other forms of epilepsy . It can be particularly difficult in PTE to localize the epileptic focus , in part because TBI may affect diffuse areas of the brain . Difficulty locating the seizure focus is seen as a deterrent to surgery . However , for people with sclerosis in the mesial temporal lobe ( in the inner aspect of the temporal lobe ) , who comprise about one third of people with intractable PTE , surgery is likely to have good outcome . When there are multiple epileptic foci or the focus cannot be localized , and drug therapy is not effective , vagus nerve stimulation is another option for treating PTE .",

Lee reported British soldiers on Governors Island spotted the submersible and rowed out to investigate . He then released the charge ( which he called a \" torpedo \" ) , \" expecting that they would seize that likewise , and thus all would be blown to atoms . \" Suspicious of the drifting charge , the British retreated back to the island .

British records contain no accounts of an attack by a submarine or any reports of explosions on the night of the supposed attack on HMS Eagle .",
  "Most neptunium ( and plutonium ) now encountered in the environment is due to atmospheric nuclear explosions that took place between the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945 and the ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963 .

  "With a large part of the French Empire 's forces now entangled in the bloody Peninsular War , the Austrian Empire believed that its best opportunity to avenge the humiliating defeat of 1805 had finally come . The Austrians were looking to defeat France and regain their former influence in Italy and Germany . In early 1809 , the Austrian war preparations were so intense that Napoleon was forced to leave Spain and head back to Paris to reorganise his main army in Germany . In spring , Nansouty was therefore recalled to the command of 1st of the three heavy cavalry divisions of the Cavalry Reserve , placed this time under the command of Marshal Jean @-@ Baptiste Bessières . As the War of the Fifth Coalition broke out , Nansouty 's division was soon detached from the Reserve and temporarily attached to Marshal Louis Nicolas Davout 's III Corps , the force that was assigned the most difficult tasks during the early military operations of this war .

  "The capillary or loop is mounted on a goniometer , which allows it to be positioned accurately within the X @-@ ray beam and rotated . Since both the crystal and the beam are often very small , the crystal must be centered within the beam to within ~ 25 micrometers accuracy , which is aided by a camera focused on the crystal . The most common type of goniometer is the \" kappa goniometer \" , which offers three angles of rotation : the ω angle , which rotates about an axis perpendicular to the beam ; the κ angle , about an axis at ~ 50 ° to the ω axis ; and , finally , the φ angle about the loop / capillary axis . When the κ angle is zero , the ω and φ axes are aligned .

  "The life cycle of Chirocephalus diaphanus is extremely fast . The typical duration of a full life cycle is not known , but a figure of around 3 months has been suggested . The eggs are tolerant to drying out ; when their habitat fills with water again , some of the eggs will hatch , while others remain dormant . This enables the species to continue to survive in an unpredictable habitat , since some eggs remain in case the habitat does not persist for long enough for the animals to mate and produce offspring . Dispersal between bodies of water can occur through the movements of animals such as cattle , deer and horses .",

  "The discovery in 1823 of Q1 — whose existence had been quite unsuspected — caused considerable interest and excitement , raising many questions of editorial practice and interpretation . Scholars immediately identified apparent deficiencies in Q1 , which was instrumental in the development of the concept of a Shakespearean \" bad quarto \" .

  "The Puritans wanted to do away with the ceremony of the Church of England and govern their churches based on a consensus of the parishioners . They preferred to eliminate bishops appointed by the monarchs , choose their own church elders ( or governors ) , and provide for a lay leader and two ministers — one a teacher in charge of doctrine , and the other a pastor in charge of people 's souls . By 1633 , Cotton 's inclination toward such Puritan practices had attracted the attention of Archbishop William Laud , who was on a campaign to suppress any preaching and practices that did not conform to the practices of the established Anglican Church . In that year , Cotton was removed from his ministry , and he went into hiding . Threatened with imprisonment , he made a hasty departure for New England aboard the ship Griffin , taking his pregnant wife . She gave birth to their child during the voyage to the colonies , whom they named Seaborn .",

  "The demise of Star Cops after just nine episodes has been seen as indicative of the decline of British television science fiction in the 1980s and , after Doctor Who followed Star Cops into cancellation in 1989 , there would be no British regular science fiction drama series on British television until Bugs began in 1995 .

  "These Northmen may have been some of those who were driven out of Dublin in 902 , but could also have been the same group who had defeated Domnall in 900 . The Chronicle states that the Northmen were killed in Srath Erenn , which is confirmed by the Annals of Ulster which records the death of Ímar grandson of Ímar and many others at the hands of the men of Fortriu in 904 . This Ímar was the first of the Uí Ímair , that is the grandsons of Ímar , to be reported ; three more grandsons of Ímar appear later in Constantín 's reign . The Fragmentary Annals of Ireland contain an account of the battle , and this attributes the defeat of the Norsemen to the intercession of Saint Columba following fasting and prayer .

  "Anne 's older sister Mary had moved to the Netherlands after her marriage to William of Orange . Protestant opposition to James was therefore increasingly focused around Anne and George instead of Mary , who was heiress presumptive . The social and political grouping centred on George and Anne was known as the \" Cockpit Circle \" after their London residence . On 5 November 1688 , William invaded England in an action , known as the \" Glorious Revolution \" , which ultimately deposed King James . George was forewarned by the Danish envoy in London , Frederick Gersdorff , that William was assembling an invasion fleet . George informed Gersdorff that James 's army was disaffected , and as a result he would refuse any command under James , but only serve as an uncommissioned volunteer . Gersdorff 's alternative plan to evacuate George and Anne to Denmark was rejected by George . George accompanied the King 's troops to Salisbury in mid @-@ November , but other nobles and their soldiers soon deserted James for William . At each defection , George apparently exclaimed , \" Est @-@ il possible ? \" ( Is it possible ? ) . He abandoned James on 24 November , and sided with William . \" So ' Est @-@ il possible ' is gone too \" , James supposedly remarked . In his memoirs , James dismissed George 's defection as trivial , saying the loss of one good trooper was of more consequence , but Gersdorff claimed the defection greatly perturbed the King . The defection of George and other nobles was instrumental in whittling away the King 's support . In December , James fled to France , and early the following year William and Mary were declared joint monarchs , with Anne as heiress presumptive .

  "Damage to the airways can cause subcutaneous emphysema ( air trapped in the subcutaneous tissue of the skin ) in the abdomen , chest , neck , and head . Subcutaneous emphysema , present in up to 85 % of people with TBI , is particularly indicative of the injury when it is only in the neck . Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs ( pneumothorax ) in about 70 % of TBI . Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air ; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear . Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum , the center of the chest cavity ( pneumomediastinum ) . If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck , a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made .

  "The appreciation of castles developed as the century progressed . During the 1770s and 1780s the concept of the picturesque ruin was popularised by the English clergyman William Gilpin . Gilpin published several works on his journeys through Britain , expounding the concept of the \" correctly picturesque \" landscape . Such a landscape , Gilpin argued , usually required a building such as a castle or other ruin to add \" consequence \" to the natural picture . Paintings in this style usually portrayed castles as indistinct , faintly coloured objects in the distance ; in writing , the picturesque account eschewed detail in favour of bold first impressions on the sense . The ruins of Goodrich particularly appealed to Gilpin and his followers ; Conwy was , however , too well preserved and uninteresting . By contrast the artistic work of antiquarians James Bentham and James Essex at the end of the century , while stopping short of being genuine archaeology , was detailed and precise enough to provide a substantial base of architectural fine detail on medieval castle features and enabled the work of architects such as Wyatt .",

The realignment eliminated overlaps with NY 425 and NY 93 , the latter of which had used NY 3 's former routing east of Cambria – Wilson Road since it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering . Even though all of the former routing had a designation , it was also designated as NY 3A anyway . As a result , the designations of all of NY 3 's spur routes were increased by one letter , meaning the existing NY 3A became NY 3B , NY 3C became NY 3D , and so forth .",

Then , when the stadium was taking losses in 1981 , he sold Stadium Corp. itself to the Browns for $ 6 million . This led to a fight the following year with Bob Gries , whose family had been part of the Browns ' ownership group since its founding and had 43 % of the team to Modell 's 53 % . Gries 's complaint was that Modell treated the Browns and Stadium Corp. as his own fiefdom , rarely consulting him about the team 's business . The sale of Stadium Corp. to the Browns , he argued , enriched Modell at the team 's expense . Gries 's case went to the Ohio Supreme Court , where he won . In 1986 , Modell had to reverse the Browns ' purchase of Stadium Corp. and pay $ 1 million in Gries 's legal fees . This left Modell in need of financial help , and it came in the form of Al Lerner , a banking and real estate executive who bought half of Stadium Corp. and 5 % of the Browns in 1986 .",

  "Döblin wrote the novel between fall 1921 and summer 1923 . According to the author , the novel set out to explore the question : \" What will become of the human being if he keeps living like he lives now ? \" Döblin would later write that the original inspiration for the novel was the sight of pebbles rolling in the surf on the Baltic Sea coast during a family vacation in the summer of 1921 ; this epiphanic vision provoked a sudden and uncharacteristic interest in nature for Döblin , who began taking extensive notes in various Berlin museums and libraries on natural history and science , geology , geography , climatology , ethnography , and other fields . If he had originally conceived of the novel as a \" hymn to the city \" and to technology , as he got into the project it increasingly became an encomium to nature . In early 1922 he closed his medical practice for a month to further his research for the novel . The section on Iceland and Greenland , which occurs towards the end of the published novel , was one of the first sections Döblin envisioned and drafted , and an advance publication of this section appeared in the Vossische Zeitung on New Year 's Day 1922 with the title Die Enteisung Grönlands im Jahre 2500 . Das Zauberschiff ( The Melting of Greenland 's Ice in the Year 2500 : The Magical Ship ) . In May 1922 Döblin rented a villa in Zehlendorf to complete the draft of the novel , a setting explicitly referenced in the novel 's unusual \" Dedication \" . The exertions of drafting the novel provoked a sort of nervous breakdown : as he would later write , \" the fantasy was too wild and my brain would not release me . \" In a 2011 biography , Wilfried Schoeller has suggested that there was an additional reason for Döblin 's breakdown — namely , that the temporary move to Zehlendorf was also his unsuccessful attempt to leave his wife in favor of his lover Charlotte Niclas . According to Schoeller , this personal dimension left its mark on the novel , especially on the novel 's dedication .",

  "A close link existed between the ruler and the Sangha ( Buddhist priesthood ) since the introduction of Buddhism to the country . This relationship was further strengthened during Dutthagamani 's reign . The monks often advised and even guided the king on decisions . This association was initially with the Mahavihara sect , but by the middle of the 1st century BC , the Abhayagiri sect had also begun to have a close link to the ruling of the country . By the end of the 3rd century AD , the Jetavana sect had also become close to the ruler . Estrangements between the ruler and the priesthood often weakened the government , as happened during the reign of Lanjatissa . Even Valagamba 's resistance movement was initially hampered because of a rift with the Mahavihara , and he succeeded only after a reconciliation was affected . Some rulers patronized only one sect , but this often led to unrest in the country and most rulers equally supported all sects .

Pathologic bones included five ribs , five vertebrae , and four bones of the feet ; several damaged bones showed osteomyelitis , a bone infection . A particular problem for the living animal was infection and trauma to the right foot that probably affected movement and may have also predisposed the other foot to injury because of a change in gait .

  "Type IIn supernovae are not listed in the table .

It appears that a significant proportion of supposed type IIn supernovae are actually supernova imposters , massive eruptions of LBV @-@ like stars similar to the Great Eruption Eta Carinae .

  "Eagle @-@ owls are distributed somewhat sparsely but can potentially inhabit a wide range of habitats , with a partiality for irregular topography . They have been found in habitats as diverse as northern coniferous forests to the edge of vast deserts . Essentially , Eurasian eagle @-@ owls have been found living in almost every climatic and environmental condition on the Eurasian continent , excluding the greatest extremities , i.e. they are absent from humid rainforest in Southeast Asia as well as the high Arctic tundra , both of which they are more or less replaced by other variety of Bubo owls . They are often found in the largest numbers in areas where cliffs and ravines are surrounded by a scattering of trees and bushes . However , grassland areas such as alpine meadows or desert @-@ like steppe can also host them so long as they have the cover and protection of rocky areas . The preference of eagle @-@ owls for places with irregular topography has been reported in most known studies . The obvious benefit of such nesting locations is that both nests and daytime roosts located in rocky areas and / or steep slopes would be less accessible to predators , including man . Also , they may be attracted to the vicinity of riparian or wetlands areas , due to the fact that the soft soil of wet areas is conducive to burrowing by the small , terrestrial mammals normally preferred in the diet , such as voles and rabbits . Due to their preference for rocky areas , the species is often found in mountainous areas and can be found up to elevations of 2 @,@ 100 m ( 6 @,@ 900 ft ) in the Alps and 4 @,@ 500 m ( 14 @,@ 800 ft ) in the Himalayas and 4 @,@ 700 m ( 15 @,@ 400 ft ) in the adjacent Tibetan Plateau . However , they can also be found living at sea @-@ level and may nest amongst rocky sea cliffs . Despite their success in areas such as sub @-@ arctic zones and mountainous that are frigid for much of the year , warmer conditions seem to result in more successful breeding attempts per studies in the Eifel region of Germany . In a study from Spain , areas primarily consisting of woodlands ( 52 % of study area being forested ) were preferred with pine trees predominating the oaks in habitats used , as opposed to truly mixed pine @-@ oak woodland . Pine and other coniferous stands are often preferred in great horned owls as well due to the constant density , which make it more likely to overlook the large birds . However , in mountainous forest , they are not generally found in enclosed wooded areas , as is the tawny owl ( Strix alucco ) . Only 2 @.@ 7 % of the habitat included in the territorial ranges for eagle @-@ owls per the habitat study in Spain consisted of cultivated or agricultural land . On the other hand , compared to golden eagles , they can visit cultivated land more regularly in hunting forays due to their nocturnal habits , which allows them to largely evade human activity . In the Italian Alps , it was found that almost no pristine habitat remained and locally eagle @-@ owls nested in the vicinity of towns , villages and ski resorts .",

  "Wilson dislikes saying his character 's catchphrase ( \" I don 't believe it ! \" ) and only performs the line for charity events for a small fee . This became a joke in the actor 's guest appearance as himself in the Father Ted episode \" The Mainland \" , where Ted annoys him by constantly repeating his catchphrase . The situation was conceived when Father Ted writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews sat behind Wilson at a performance of Le Cirque du Soleil at the Royal Albert Hall . They considered how \" tasteless and wrong \" it would be to lean forward to him every time that an acrobat did a stunt and yell the catchphrase , and then they realised that that 's exactly what their fictional priests would do . This was also played upon when Wilson made a guest appearance on the comedy TV quiz show Shooting Stars , in which Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer purposefully misquoted his catchphrase by referring to him as \" Richard ' I don 't believe you ' Wilson \" .",

  "With the ongoing conflict with Chart House on the mind of the company 's board in 1978 , Burger King hired McDonald 's executive Donald N. Smith to help revamp the company . Smith initiated a restructuring of all future franchising agreements . New owners were barred from living more than an hour 's drive from their restaurants , corporations were not permitted to own franchises , and franchisees could no longer operate other chains . This new policy effectively limited the size of franchisees and prevented larger franchises from challenging Burger King as Chart House had . It also became a requirement for the corporation to own the properties of any new store and lease them to franchisees . This policy would allow the company to take over the operations of failing stores or evict those owners who would not conform to the company guidelines and policies . Beyond the changes to the franchise system , Smith also restructured Burger King 's corporate operations to better compete against his former employer as well as then up and coming chain Wendy 's . He broadened the product offering by adding the Burger King specialty sandwich line in 1979 , and also added many non @-@ hamburger sandwiches including new chicken and fish offerings . The new line was one of the first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic , in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years , members of which were presumably willing spend more on a higher quality product .

Yet his mother , Narcissa Owen , according to her own account in her memoirs ( 1907 ) , would herself appear to have been only 1 / 16th Cherokee , which if correct would imply that her son was 1 / 32nd Cherokee . Beyond this , the editor of Narcissa 's memoirs has raised the possibility that Narcissa might unwittingly have missed out \" one generation or possibly two \" in her account of her family tree ; adjusting for this possibility might further dilute her Cherokee blood .

  "Transcription produces a single @-@ stranded RNA molecule known as messenger RNA , whose nucleotide sequence is complementary to the DNA from which it was transcribed . The mRNA acts as an intermediate between the DNA gene and its final protein product . The gene 's DNA is used as a template to generate a complementary mRNA . The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene 's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand . Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase , which reads the template strand in the 3 ' to 5 ' direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5 ' to 3 ' . To initiate transcription , the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene . Thus , a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region , either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase , or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible .",

  "The second issue is whether the name should be Leopoldia . In 1819 Herbert had proposed Leopoldia as a nomen provisorium ( provisional name ) for the same taxon as he called Hippeastrum in 1821 . Although Leopoldia was subsequently validated ( i.e. became the correct name ) , this was overlooked , and Hippeastrum rather than Leopoldia was used for the genus of New World amaryllids .

  "In the interim came The Beatles , a double LP commonly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover . Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction : without Epstein 's guiding presence , the group had briefly turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru . At his ashram in Rishikesh , India , a \" Guide Course \" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods , yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album .

  "The three certainties refer to a rule within English trusts law on the creation of express trusts that , to be valid , the trust instrument must show certainty of intention , subject matter and object . \" Certainty of intention \" means that it must be clear that the donor or testator wishes to create a trust ; this is not dependent on any particular language used , and a trust can be created without the word \" trust \" being used , or even the donor knowing he is creating a trust . Since the 1950s , the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to create a trust , rather than hold that the trust is void . \" Certainty of subject matter \" means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust . Historically the property must have been segregated from non @-@ trust property ; more recently , the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets , holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation . \" Certainty of objects \" means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries , or objects , are .

  "In 1837 Bird took part in an investigation of the dangers posed by the arsenic content of cheap candles . These were stearin candles with white arsenic added , which made them burn more brightly than ordinary candles . The combination of cheapness and brightness made them popular . The investigation was conducted by the Westminster Medical Society , a student society of Westminster Hospital , and was led by John Snow , later to become famous for his public health investigations . Snow had previously investigated arsenic poisoning when he and several fellow students were taken badly ill after he introduced a new process for preserving cadavers at the suggestion of lecturer Hunter Lane . The new process involved injecting arsenic into the blood vessels of the corpse . Snow found that the arsenic became airborne as a result of chemical reactions with the decomposing corpse , and this was how it was ingested . Bird 's part in the candle investigation was to analyse the arsenic content of the candles , which he found to have recently been greatly increased by the manufacturers . Bird also confirmed by experiment that the arsenic became airborne when the candles were burnt . The investigators exposed various species of animal and bird to the candles in controlled conditions . The animals all survived , but the birds died . Bird investigated the bird deaths and analysed the bodies , finding small amounts of arsenic . No arsenic was found on the feathers , however , indicating that poisoning was not caused by breathing airborne arsenic , since arsenic in the air would be expected to adhere to the feathers . However , Bird found that large amounts of arsenic were in the birds ' drinking water , indicating that this was the route taken by the poison .",

  "The Hawaii hotspot is a volcanic hotspot located near the namesake Hawaiian Islands , in the northern Pacific Ocean . One of the most well @-@ known and heavily studied hotspots in the world , the Hawaii plume is responsible for the creation of the Hawaiian – Emperor seamount chain , a chain of volcanoes over 5 @,@ 800 kilometres ( 3 @,@ 600 mi ) long . Four of these volcanoes are active , two are dormant , and more than 123 are extinct , many having since been ground beneath the waves by erosion as seamounts and atolls . The chain extends from south of the island of Hawaiʻi to the edge of the Aleutian Trench , near the eastern edge of Russia . While most volcanoes are created by geological activity at tectonic plate boundaries , the Hawaii hotspot is located far from plate boundaries . The classic hotspot theory , first proposed in 1963 by John Tuzo Wilson , proposes that a single , fixed mantle plume builds volcanoes that then , cut off from their source by the movement of the Pacific Plate , become increasingly inactive and eventually erode below sea level over millions of years .

At the police station , Dexter discusses another murder case being handled by James Doakes ( Erik King ) , who hates Dexter and suspects he is hiding something .

  "To support their categorization of certain films as noirs and their rejection of others , many critics refer to a set of elements they see as marking examples of the mode . The question of what constitutes the set of noir 's identifying characteristics is a fundamental source of controversy . For instance , critics tend to define the model film noir as having a tragic or bleak conclusion , but many acknowledged classics of the genre have clearly happy endings ( e.g. , Stranger on the Third Floor , The Big Sleep , Dark Passage , and The Dark Corner ) , while the tone of many other noir denouements is ambivalent . Some critics perceive classic noir 's hallmark as a distinctive visual style . Others , observing that there is actually considerable stylistic variety among noirs , instead emphasize plot and character type . Still others focus on mood and attitude . No survey of classic noir 's identifying characteristics can therefore be considered definitive . In the 1990s and 2000s , critics have increasingly turned their attention to that diverse field of films called neo @-@ noir ; once again , there is even less consensus about the defining attributes of such films made outside the classic period .",

The commander of the 211th Infantry Regiment , Colonel Kisou Ouchi , assumed command of the Japanese forces on Morotai on 12 October . Allied codebreakers were often able to warn the forces at Morotai of attempts to run the blockade , and PT boats destroyed a large number of the barges the Japanese used to transport troops from Halmahera . The Allies were , however , unable to completely stop the Japanese buildup .",

  "From analysis of the existing small treatment trials of cervical artery dissection ( carotid and vertebral ) it appears that aspirin and anticoagulation ( heparin followed by warfarin ) are equally effective in reducing the risk of further stroke or death . Anticoagulation is regarded as more powerful than antiplatelet therapy , but anticoagulants may increase the size of the hematoma and worsen obstruction of the affected artery . Anticoagulation may be relatively unsafe if a large stroke has already occurred , as hemorrhagic transformation is relatively common , and if the dissection extends into V4 ( carrying a risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage ) . Anticoagulation may be appropriate if there is rapid blood flow ( through a severely narrowed vessel ) on transcranial doppler despite the use of aspirin , if there is a completely occluded vessel , if there are recurrent stroke @-@ like episodes , or if free @-@ floating blood clot is visible on scans . Warfarin is typically continued for 3 – 6 months , as during this time the flow through the artery usually improves , and most strokes happen within the first 6 months after the development of the dissection .

  "Caligari continues to be one of the most discussed and debated films from the Weimar Republic . Two major books have played a large part in shaping the perception of the film and its impact on cinema as a whole : Siegfried Kracauer 's From Caligari to Hitler ( 1947 ) and Lotte Eisner 's The Haunted Screen ( 1974 ) . From Caligari to Hitler based its claims about the film largely on an unpublished typescript by Hans Janowitz called Caligari : The Story of a Famous Story , which gave Janowitz and Carl Mayer principal credit for the making of Caligari . Mike Budd wrote of Kracauer 's book : \" Perhaps no film or period has been so thoroughly understood through a particular interpretation as has Caligari , and Weimar cinema generally , through Kracauer 's social @-@ psychological approach \" . Prior to the publication of From Caligari to Hitler , few critics had derived any symbolic political meaning from the film , but Kracauer ’ s argument that it symbolized German obedience toward authority and a premonition of the rise of Adolf Hitler ( see the Themes section for more ) drastically changed attitudes about Caligari . Many of his interpretations of the film are still embraced , even by those who have strongly disagreed with his general premise , and even as certain claims Kracauer made have been disproven , such as his statement that the original script included no frame story . ( See Writing for more . ) Eisner 's book placed Caligari into historical context by identifying how it influenced Expressionist features in other films of the 1920s .",

  "Coenwulf died in 821 at Basingwerk near Holywell , Flintshire , probably while making preparations for a campaign against the Welsh that took place under his brother and successor , Ceolwulf , the following year . A mid @-@ 11th century source asserts that Cynehelm briefly succeeded to the throne while still a child and was then murdered by his tutor Æscberht at the behest of Cwoenthryth .

The opinion of historians is not unanimous on this point : Simon Keynes has suggested that the ealdorman is unlikely to be the same person as the prince and that Cynehelm therefore may well have survived to the end of his father 's reign . Regardless of interpretation of Cynehelm 's legend , there does appear to have been dynastic discord early in Ceolwulf 's reign : a document from 825 says that after the death of Coenwulf \" much discord and innumerable disagreements arose between various kings , nobles , bishops and ministers of the Church of God on very many matters of secular business \" .",

  "In the 6th century BC , the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus experimented with amber rods and these experiments were the first studies into the production of electrical energy . While this method , now known as the triboelectric effect , can lift light objects and generate sparks , it is extremely inefficient . It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available . The voltaic pile , and its modern descendant , the electrical battery , store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy . The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications , but its energy storage is finite , and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged . For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines .",

  "It may have been possible for the husband of an epikleros to allow the posthumous adoption of the son of an epikleros as the son of the epikleros ' father . This would prevent the inheritance of the newly adopted son of any property from his natural father , but it had the advantage of preserving the adoptee 's oikos , commonly translated as \" household \" but incorporating ideas of kinship and property also . Although the preservation of the paternal oikos is usually felt to be the reason behind the whole practice of the epiklerate , the historian David Schaps argues that in fact , this was not really the point of the practice . Instead , he argues , that it was the practice of adoption that allowed the preservation of an oikos . Schaps feels that the reason the epiklerate evolved was to ensure that orphaned daughters were married . Other historians , including Sarah Pomeroy , feel that the children of an epikleros were considered to transmit the paternal grandfather 's oikos . The historian Cynthia Patterson agrees , arguing that adoption may have seemed unnecessary , especially if the epikleros and her husband gave their son the name of the maternal grandfather . She argues that too much attention has been paid to the patrilineal aspects of the oikos , and that there was probably less emphasis on this in actual Athenian practice and more on keeping a household together as a productive unit .",

  "Beginning his schooling at the age of seven , Walker studied Latin at various private and public schools in Brookfield before being sent to the Leicester Academy when he was twelve . He completed his college preparation by the time he was fourteen and spent another year studying Greek and Latin under the future suffragist and abolitionist Lucy Stone , and entered Amherst College at the age of fifteen . Although he had planned to matriculate at Harvard after his first year at Amherst , Walker 's father believed his son was too young to enter the larger college and insisted he remain at Amherst . While he had entered with the class of 1859 , Walker became ill during his first year there and fell back a year . He was a member of the Delta Kappa and Athenian societies as a freshman , joined and withdrew from Alpha Sigma Phi as a sophomore on account of \" rowdyism \" , and finally joined Delta Kappa Epsilon .

  "Dugongs are semi @-@ nomadic , often travelling long distances in search of food , but staying within a certain range their entire life . Large numbers often move together from one area to another . It is thought that these movements are caused by changes in seagrass availability . Their memory allows them to return to specific points after long travels . Dugong movements mostly occur within a localised area of seagrass beds , and animals in the same region show individualistic patterns of movement . Daily movement is affected by the tides . In areas where there is a large tidal range , dugongs travel with the tide in order to access shallower feeding areas . In Moreton Bay , dugongs often travel between foraging grounds inside the bay and warmer oceanic waters . At higher latitudes dugongs make seasonal travels to reach warmer water during the winter . Occasionally individual dugongs make long @-@ distance travels over many days , and can travel over deep ocean waters . One animal was seen as far south as Sydney .

  "Except for his juvenilia , few of which have survived , Mahler composed only in the media of song and symphony , with a close and complex interrelationship between the two . Donald Mitchell writes that this interaction is the backcloth against which all Mahler 's music can be considered . The initial connection between song and symphony occurs with the song @-@ cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen and the First Symphony . Although this early evidence of cross @-@ fertilisation is important , it is during Mahler 's extended Wunderhorn phase , in which his Second , Third and Fourth Symphonies were written , that the song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled . Themes from the Wunderhorn song Das himmlische Leben ( \" The Heavenly Life \" ) , composed in 1892 , became a key element in the Third Symphony completed in 1896 ; the song itself forms the finale to the Fourth ( 1900 ) and its melody is central to the whole composition . For the Second Symphony , written between 1888 and 1894 , Mahler worked simultaneously on the Wunderhorn song , Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt ( \" The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes \" ) , and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony 's third movement . Another Wunderhorn setting from 1892 , Urlicht ( \" Primal Light \" ) , is used as the Second Symphony 's fourth ( penultimate ) movement .",

  "Eventually , Shashthi came to represent all goddesses and forces responsible for causing diseases in children and their mothers , who needed to be propitiated on the sixth day after childbirth to prevent these illnesses .

  "The A @-@ 4 ballistic missile ( referred to as the V @-@ 2 from September 1944 ) was developed by the Germans between 1939 and 1944 . It was regarded by Adolf Hitler as a Wunderwaffe ( wonder weapon ) that he believed to be capable of turning the tide of the war . Its operational deployment was restricted by several factors . Large supplies of cryogenic liquid oxygen ( LOX ) were required as the oxidizer to fuel the missiles .

Germany and the occupied countries did not at that time have sufficient manufacturing capacity for the amount of LOX required for a full @-@ scale A @-@ 4 campaign ; the total production capacity in 1941 and 1942 was about 215 tons daily , but each A @-@ 4 launch required about 15 tons . As the missile was intended for use against London and southern England , its operational range of 320 kilometres ( 200 mi ) meant that the launch sites had to be located fairly close to the English Channel or southern North Sea coasts , in northern France , Belgium or the western Netherlands . This was within easy reach of the Allied air forces , so any site would have to be able to resist or evade the expected aerial bombardments .",

  "An occluded front is formed during the process of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front . The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion , which is also known as the triple point in meteorology . It lies within a sharp trough , but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold . In a cold occlusion , the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front , and plows under both air masses . In a warm occlusion , the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front , and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air .

  "The curved design offered two major benefits to the structure of the building . First , curved designs , such as that found in Calatrava 's Turning Torso in Malmö , Sweden , tend to add to the strength of a structure . A similar principle has been used in the past with curved stadium roofs . In addition to structural support , the curved face of the exterior would minimize wind forces . In rectangular buildings , a fluid wind flow puts pressure on the windward face of the building ; while air moves around it , a suction is applied to the leeward face . This often causes a sway in tall buildings usually counteracted , at least partially , by stiffening the structure or by using a dynamic wind damper . Since the curved design of the Chicago Spire would not completely negate wind forces , a tapering concrete core and twelve shear walls radiating from it were planned to counteract the remaining wind load .",

And whilst the fixed stars are carried around in a complete circle by the stellar sphere , the Sun , Moon and planets do not revolve under the Earth between setting and rising again like the stars do , but rather on setting they go laterally around the Earth like a cap turning halfway around the head until they rise again . And unlike Anaximander , he relegated the fixed stars to the region most distant from the Earth . The most enduring feature of Anaximenes ' cosmos was its conception of the stars being fixed on a crystal sphere as in a rigid frame , which became a fundamental principle of cosmology down to Copernicus and Kepler .",

They fledge about 10 days after hatching ( range 9 – 12 ) , leaving the nest shortly before they are able to fly . They are assisted with feeding for a further two weeks , and the family may stay together for a few days after that . The short incubation and fledging times may be a result of predation pressure , the rapid development of the chicks enabling them to leave the vulnerable nest as early as possible , even while still flightless . This avoids the possible loss of an entire brood , but means that the adults must provide food to the young for a significant period until they can fend for themselves . One brood per year is normal , although a few second broods are known .",

  "In Paris , Zajączek quickly became involved with the active emigre groups there . Hoping to sway revolutionary France into supporting the Polish cause , many Poles , including him , volunteered to join the French Revolutionary Army , eventually leading to the creation of the Polish Legions in Italy led by Jan Henryk Dąbrowski , which became a part of Napoleon 's army . On 8 March 1797 Napoleon ordered that Zajączek should be recognized as an active brigade general of the French army . That year he published a brochure on his experiences of the 1794 war , Histoire de la révolution de Pologne en 1794 , in which he tried to justify his actions . Zajączek was , however , still unpopular among the Polish troops , many of whom blamed him for the fall of Praga ; due to frequent personal conflicts , Zajączek chose to remain with the French army , rather than joining the Legions themselves . Over the coming years , he took part in the French Revolutionary Wars . He took part in the 1798 Egyptian Expedition . There he also served as a governor of several provinces , first , from July that year , of the Monufia Governorate , later , from January 1799 , simultaneously of the Faiyum Governorate and Beni Suef Governorate . On 25 January 1800 he defeated Murad Bey at the Battle of Sédiman . In 1801 he was promoted to division general , and later took part in the failed defense of Alexandria .",

The current Psi Epsilon Chapter of Zeta Psi at Dartmouth was established in 1920 .

  "Like many earthstars , the fungus uses the force of falling raindrops to help disperse the spores , which are ejected in little bursts when objects ( such as rain ) strike the outer wall of the spore sac . The gleba is brown to grayish @-@ brown , with a cotton @-@ like texture that , when compressed , allows the endoperidium to flex quickly and create a puff of air that is forced out through the ostioles .

  "Animation can provide wide open vistas for stories ; the French film Fantastic Planet ( 1972 ) explored ideas beyond the limits of traditional , live @-@ action science fiction films . Phil Hoad of The Guardian identifies Akira ( 1988 ) as introducing violent , adult Japanese animation ( known as anime ) to the West and paving the way for later works . Anime , according to academic Brian Ruh , is not a cult genre , but the lack of individual fandoms inside anime fandom itself lends itself to a bleeding over of cult attention and can help spread works internationally . Anime , which is often highly franchised , provides its fans with alternative fictional canons and points of view that can drive fan activity . The Ghost in the Shell franchise , for example , provided Japanese fans with enough bonus material and spinoffs that it encouraged cult tendencies . Markets that did not support the sale of these materials saw less cult activity . Ralph Bakshi 's career has been marked with controversy : Fritz the Cat ( 1972 ) , the first animated film to be rated \" X \" by the MPAA , provoked outrage for its racial caricatures and graphic depictions of sex , and Coonskin ( 1975 ) was decried as racist . Bakshi recalls that older animators had tired of \" kid stuff \" and desired edgier work , whereas younger animators hated his work for \" destroying the Disney images \" . Eventually , his work would be reassessed and cult followings , which include Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez , developed around several of his films . Heavy Metal ( 1981 ) faced similar denunciations from critics ; Donald Liebenson of the Los Angeles Times cites the violence and sexual imagery as alienating critics , who did not know what to make of the film .

The Whigs initially hoped to muzzle Harrison and Tyler , lest they make policy statements that alienated parts of the party . But after Tyler 's Democratic rival , Vice President Johnson , made a successful speaking tour , Tyler was called upon to travel from Williamsburg to Columbus , Ohio , and there address a local convention , a speech intended to assure Northerners that he shared Harrison 's views . In his journey of nearly two months , Tyler made speeches at rallies .

In The Simpsons , politicians are corrupt , ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers , and the local police force is incompetent .",

Efforts were made to regularise conditions in local prisons but without much success , and these failures led to prison reform in 1877 which nationalised British prisons , including prisons at castles like York . Compensation was paid to the former owners , although in cases such as York where the facilities were considered so poor as to require complete reconstruction , this payment was denied .

  "P. longiceps was described by Gustav Mayr in 1868 , based on a holotype worker collected in Baltic amber from the Eocene . The original specimen collected by Mayr , however , has been lost . The estimated body length of P. longiceps is 12 to 14 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 47 to 0 @.@ 55 in ) long , with a thick petiole and large propodeal teeth . Unlike P. janzeni , P. longiceps has erect and suberect hairs on the scape . These hairs are also longer and thicker on the legs and on other body parts .

  "As the Sun orbits the Milky Way , wandering stars may approach close enough to have a disruptive influence on the Solar System . A close stellar encounter may cause a significant reduction in the perihelion distances of comets in the Oort cloud — a spherical region of icy bodies orbiting within half a light year of the Sun . Such an encounter can trigger a 40 @-@ fold increase in the number of comets reaching the inner Solar System . Impacts from these comets can trigger a mass extinction of life on Earth . These disruptive encounters occur at an average of once every 45 million years . The mean time for the Sun to collide with another star in the solar neighborhood is approximately 3 × 1013 years , which is much longer than the estimated age of the Milky Way galaxy , at 1 – 2 × 1010 years . This can be taken as an indication of the low likelihood of such an event occurring during the lifetime of the Earth .",

  "The route towards the hustings between the special constables was narrow , and as the inexperienced horses were thrust further and further into the crowd they reared and plunged as people tried to get out of their way . The arrest warrant had been given to the Deputy Constable , Joseph Nadin , who followed behind the yeomanry . As the cavalry pushed towards the speakers ' stand they became stuck in the crowd , and in panic started to hack about them with their sabres . On his arrival at the stand Nadin arrested Hunt , Johnson and a number of others including John Tyas , the reporter from The Times . Their mission to execute the arrest warrant having been achieved , the yeomanry set about destroying the banners and flags on the stand . According to Tyas , the yeomanry then attempted to reach flags in the crowd \" cutting most indiscriminately to the right and to the left to get at them \" - only then ( said Tyas ) were brickbats thrown at the military : \" From this point the Manchester and Salford Yeomanry lost all command of temper \" . From his vantage point William Hulton perceived the unfolding events as an assault on the yeomanry , and on L 'Estrange 's arrival at 1 : 50 pm , at the head of his hussars , he ordered them into the field to disperse the crowd with the words : \" Good God , Sir , don 't you see they are attacking the Yeomanry ; disperse the meeting ! \" The 15th Hussars formed themselves into a line stretching across the eastern end of St Peter 's Field , and charged into the crowd . At about the same time the Cheshire Yeomanry charged from the southern edge of the field . At first the crowd had some difficulty in dispersing , as the main exit route into Peter Street was blocked by the 88th Regiment of Foot , standing with bayonets fixed .

The punishment for non @-@ compliance was death . This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe . For Han officials and literati , however , the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning ( because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one 's body intact ) , whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility . Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule , the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest .

  "The script of the film went through several changes during filming .

  "Austen scholars have studied the film 's intersection with class and social change . Carole M. Dole notes that , among the many productions of Austen 's work that appeared in the 1990s , Persuasion was the only one to \" insistently draw attention to class issues \" , and \" provide striking visual testimony to the workings of the British class system \" . The film , she adds , accomplishes this in part by focusing on the servants ' faces , gauging their negative reactions to events . Richards , too , finds Michell \" visually more aware \" of the lower classes , adding that the film 's inclusion of black servants alludes to the \" colonial sources of wealth \" supporting those superior in class and rank . Anne @-@ Marie Scholz writes that the film and Emma Thompson 's Sense and Sensibility both highlight the theme of class , but in different ways . Unlike Sense and Sensibility , Persuasion depicts general class divisions rather than just how the working class impacts the protagonists — the camera focuses on the faces and expressions of servants and working people , personifying them .",

  "First invented in China , cannon were among the earliest forms of gunpowder artillery , and over time replaced siege engines — among other forms of ageing weaponry — on the battlefield . In the Middle East , the first use of the hand cannon is argued to be during the 1260 Battle of Ain Jalut between the Mamluks and Mongols . The first cannon in Europe were in use in Iberia by the mid @-@ 13th century . It was during this period , the Middle Ages , that cannon became standardized , and more effective in both the anti @-@ infantry and siege roles . After the Middle Ages most large cannon were abandoned in favour of greater numbers of lighter , more maneuverable pieces . In addition , new technologies and tactics were developed , making most defences obsolete ; this led to the construction of star forts , specifically designed to withstand artillery bombardment though these too ( along with the Martello Tower ) would find themselves rendered obsolete when explosive and armour piercing rounds made even these types of fortifications vulnerable .",
