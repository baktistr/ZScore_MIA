He kept the items he collected for himself , and there are no records of any being handed over to the Australian War Records Section , the AIF unit responsible for collecting items for later display in Australia . Hines sold some of the items he collected to other soldiers , including for alcohol . The photograph of Hines at the Battle of Polygon Wood was published in late 1917 under the title Wild Eye , the souvenir king and became one of the best @-@ known Australian photographs of the war . Many soldiers identified with Hines and were amused by his collection of souvenirs . The photograph was used as propaganda , and a false story developed that the German Kaiser Wilhelm II had become enraged after seeing it .",

  "The conservation of the LRL vector corresponds to a subtle symmetry of the system .

  "Limited toleration and the influence of exiled Scots and Protestants in other countries , led to the expansion of Protestantism , with a group of lairds declaring themselves Lords of the Congregation in 1557 and representing their interests politically . The collapse of the French alliance and English intervention in 1560 meant that a relatively small , but highly influential , group of Protestants were in a position to impose reform on the Scottish church . A confession of faith , rejecting papal jurisdiction and the mass , was adopted by Parliament in 1560 , while the young Mary , Queen of Scots was still in France . Knox , having escaped the galleys and spent time in Geneva , where he became a follower of Calvin , emerged as the most significant figure . The Calvinism of the reformers led by Knox resulted in a settlement that adopted a Presbyterian system and rejected most of the elaborate trappings of the Medieval church . This gave considerable power within the new kirk to local lairds , who often had control over the appointment of the clergy , and resulting in widespread , but generally orderly , iconoclasm . At this point the majority of the population was probably still Catholic in persuasion and the kirk would find it difficult to penetrate the Highlands and Islands , but began a gradual process of conversion and consolidation that , compared with reformations elsewhere , was conducted with relatively little persecution .",

Ratsimilaho was elected king of all the Betsimisaraka and given a new name , Ramaromanompo ( \" Lord Served by Many \" ) at his capital at Foulpointe .

He then negotiated peace with the Betanimena by offering their king control over the port of Tamatave , but this settlement fell apart after six months , leading Ratsimilaho to recapture Tamatave and force the Betanimena king to flee south . He established alliances with the southern Betsimisaraka and the neighboring Bezanozano , extending his authority over these areas by allowing local chiefs to maintain their power while offering tribute of rice , cattle and slaves ; by 1730 he was one of the most powerful kings of Madagascar .

  "Hartebeest are primarily grazers , and their diets consist mostly of grasses . A study in the Nazinga Game Ranch in Burkina Faso found that the hartebeest 's skull structure eased the acquisition and chewing of highly fibrous foods . The hartebeest has much lower food intake than the other members of Alcelaphini . The long thin muzzle of the hartebeest assists in feeding on leaf blades of short grasses and nibbling off leaf sheaths from grass stems . In addition to this , it can derive nutritious food even from tall senile grasses . These adaptations of the hartebeest enable the animal to feed well even in the dry season , which is usually a difficult period for grazers . For instance , in comparison with the roan antelope , the hartebeest is better at procuring and chewing the scarce regrowth of perennial grasses at times when forage is least available . These unique abilities could have allowed the hartebeest to prevail over other animals millions of years ago , leading to its successful radiation in Africa .",

  "Forman and his colleagues were committed to the strategy of casting non @-@ professionals and utilizing dialogue improvisation whenever possible . Most of the actors were chosen from among relatives , friends and acquaintances of Forman and his crew , to the point where Forman was later to liken the atmosphere to making a \" home movie \" . For the title role , Forman selected his 18 @-@ year @-@ old ex @-@ sister @-@ in @-@ law , Hana Brejchová , not because , as was rumored at the time , he wanted revenge on his ex @-@ wife , movie @-@ star Jana Brejchová , but because he had known Hana a long time , trusted her , and had great respect for her natural talents : \" She had an amazing ability of free expression , but with the risk that she didn ’ t recognize the extent . However , Vlada Pucholt [ who played Milda ] held her firmly in the rhythm of the scene , in a professional position . ” The character of Milda 's father was played by the uncle of Forman 's cameraman , and Milda 's mother was played by a factory lathe operator whom Passer and Papoušek had met on a streetcar , and who struck them as someone who \" seemed so interested in things around her , no matter how silly \" . The factory supervisor was played by the actual public relations manager of the factory at Zruč nad Sázavou , where location shooting took place . For the main trio of reservists , Forman wanted to use non @-@ professionals , including the writer Josef Škvorecký , but found that , while the three men did well improvising together whenever they appeared in pairs , they lost their rhythm when all three were included in the same shot . So Forman went to Škvorecký and told the writer that he looked too intelligent to play his role and replaced him with the professional actor Vladimir Mensik . In Škvorecký 's words : \" To tell someone that he is too intelligent to be an actor is a very nice way of letting him know that he should stay with screen @-@ play writing . Milos is a very considerate person . The fact that he so gently threw me out made possible the greatest scene of Loves of a Blonde \" . Forman was later to justify his decision to add a professional : \" While nonactors keep the actors honest and real , the actors give the scene the rhythm and shape that the nonactors don 't feel . A nonactor inhabits the situation so completely that he or she isn 't able to view it from the outside , to perceive it as a rhythmic whole with its punctuation and its larger dramatic purpose . Nonactors are perfectly content to repeat themselves and ramble on , so an actor can pull them through the dramatic arch of the scene and draw out the emotional contours of the situation . \" .",

  "Horses were known to humans on what is now the Iberian Peninsula as far back as 25 @,@ 000 to 20 @,@ 000 BC , as shown by cave paintings in the area . Among the local wild horses originally used by humans were the probable ancestors of the modern Lusitano , as studies comparing ancient and modern horse DNA indicate that the modern \" Lusitano C \" group contains maternal lineages also present in wild Iberian horses from the Early Neolithic period . These ancient horses were used for war , with clear evidence of their use by Phoenicians around 1100 BC and Celts around 600 BC . It is believed that these invaders also brought horses with them , contributing outside blood to the ancestry of the modern Iberian breeds . By 800 BC , the alliance known as Celtiberians had been formed by the Iberians and Celts , and from this point on the horses bred in this area were renowned as war horses . Xenophon , writing around 370 BC , admired the advanced horsemanship and riding techniques used by Iberian horsemen in war , made possible in part by their agile horses . Legend claimed that mares of the area were sired by the wind ( hence their amazing swiftness , passed onto their foals ) , and one modern hypothesis suggests that the bond between Iberian humans and horses was the initial inspiration for the centaur , which was believed to come from the area of the Tagus River . Later invasions into the area by Carthaginians and Romans resulted in these civilizations establishing stud farms that bred cavalry horses for the Roman army from local stock .",

  "The idea for \" Mother Simpson \" was pitched by Richard Appel , who decided to do something about Homer 's mother , who previously had only been mentioned once . Many of the writers could not believe that an episode about Homer 's mother had not previously been produced . Part of the fun of an episode about Homer 's mother for the writers was that they were able to solve several little puzzles , such as where Lisa 's intelligence came from . The ending shot with Homer gazing at the sky was decided at the table read , but the drawing at the end was inserted by David Silverman because it was felt that the scene was so touching that no other lines were needed . As a result , no promos were aired over the credits during the original airing of the episode . Bill Oakley has admitted that he always gets teary @-@ eyed when he watches the ending .",

  "The relative chronology of Sahure 's reign is well established by historical records and contemporary artefacts , showing that he succeeded Userkaf and was in turn succeeded by Neferirkare Kakai . The Turin canon , a king list written during the 19th Dynasty in the early Ramesside era ( 1292 – 1189 BC ) , credits him with a reign of 12 years 5 months and 12 days . In contrast , the near contemporary annal of the 5th Dynasty known as the Palermo Stone preserves his 2nd , 3rd , 5th and 6th years on the throne as well as his final year of reign and even records the day of his death as the 28th of Shemu II ( 9th month ) . The document notes six or seven cattle counts , which would indicate a reign of at least 12 full years if the Old Kingdom cattle count was held biennially ( i.e. every 2 years ) as this annal document implies for the early 5th Dynasty . If this assumption is correct and Sahure 's highest attested date was the year after the 6th count rather than his 7th count as Wilkinson believes , then this date would mean that Sahure died in his 13th year and should be given a reign of 13 years 5 months and 12 days . This number would be only one year more than the Turin Canon 's 12 @-@ year figure for Sahure .

  "It is terribly severe on Mr. W. S. Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan , the joint authors of Thespis , that their work was produced in such a crude and unsatisfactory state . Thespis on its own merits — merits of literary worth , merits of fun , merits of song writing deserves to succeed ; but the management has crippled a good play by insufficiency of rehearsals and a want of that requisite polish and aplomb without which these merry operas are useless . I must state , however , that Thespis is well worth seeing ; and when it has been corrected and attracts the proper Gaiety audience , it will hold its own bravely . It is a pity , indeed , that such a play , so rich in humour and so delicate in music , was produced for the edification of a Boxing @-@ Night audience . Anything would have done for such an occasion .... Unless I am very much mistaken , and despite the hisses of Boxing @-@ Night ... the ballads and wit of Mr. Gilbert [ and ] the pretty strains of Mr. Arthur Sullivan ... will carry Thespis through and make it — as it deserves to be — the most praiseworthy piece of the Christmas season .",

Static movements are those that are performed slowly , with the climber 's position controlled by maintaining contact on the boulder with the other three limbs .

  "In the decade following his accession in 359 BC , the Macedonian king , Philip II , had rapidly strengthened and expanded his kingdom into Thrace and Chalkidiki on the northern coast of the Aegean Sea . He was aided in this process by the distraction of Athens and Thebes , the two most powerful city @-@ states in Greece at that point , by events elsewhere . In particular , these events included the Social War between Athens and her erstwhile allies ( 357 – 355 BC ) , and the Third Sacred War which erupted in central Greece in 356 BC between the Phocians and the other members of the Delphic Amphictyonic League . Much of Philip 's expansion during this period was at the nominal expense of the Athenians , who considered the north Aegean coast as their sphere of influence , and Philip was at war with Athens from 356 – 346 BC .",
  "Fossil records of Myxogastria are extremely rare . Due to their short lifespan and the fragile structures of the plasmodia and the fruit body , fossilisation and similar processes are not possible . Only their spores can be mineralised . The few known examples of fossilised living states are preserved in amber . Up to 2010 , three fruit bodies , two spores and one plasmodium have been described . Two older taxa – Charles Eugène Bertrand 's Myxomycetes mangini and Bretonia hardingheni from 1892 – are now considered dubious and are today often disregarded . Friedrich Walter Domke described in 1952 a 35 to 40 million year old find in Baltic amber of Stemonitis splendens , an extant species . The state and completeness of the fruit bodies are remarkable , enabling accurate determination . From the same period , location and material is an Arcyria sulcata , first described in 2003 by Heinrich Dörfelt and Alexander Schmidt , a species very similar to today 's Arcyria denudata . Both discoveries imply that the fruit bodies of the Myxogastria have changed only slightly in the last 35 to 40 million years .",

  "Wollstonecraft has what scholar Cora Kaplan labelled in 2002 a \" curious \" legacy that has evolved over time : \" for an author @-@ activist adept in many genres ... up until the last quarter @-@ century Wollstonecraft 's life has been read much more closely than her writing \" . After the devastating effect of Godwin 's Memoirs , Wollstonecraft 's reputation lay in tatters for a century ; she was pilloried by such writers as Maria Edgeworth , who patterned the \" freakish \" Harriet Freke in Belinda ( 1801 ) after her . Other novelists such as Mary Hays , Charlotte Turner Smith , Fanny Burney , and Jane West created similar figures , all to teach a \" moral lesson \" to their readers . ( Hays had been a close friend , and helped nurse her in her dying days . ) Scholar Virginia Sapiro states that few read Wollstonecraft 's works during the nineteenth century as \" her attackers implied or stated that no self @-@ respecting woman would read her work \" .

Lucretia Mott , a Quaker minister , and Elizabeth Cady Stanton , Americans who met at the World Anti @-@ Slavery Convention in London , discovered they had both read Wollstonecraft , and agreed the need for what became the Seneca Falls Convention , an influential women 's rights meeting held in 1848 . Another who read Wollstonecraft was George Eliot , a prolific writer of reviews , articles , novels , and translations . In 1855 , she devoted an essay to the roles and rights of women , comparing Wollstonecraft and Margaret Fuller . Fuller was an American journalist , critic , and women 's right activist who , like Wollstonecraft , had travelled to the Continent , been involved in the struggle for reform ( in this case the Roman Republic ) , and had a child by a man without marrying him .

  "The flexibility of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers to choose the fuel depending on current market prices . As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol 's energy content is close to 34 % less per unit volume than gasoline , flex cars running on ethanol get a lower mileage than when running on pure gasoline . However , this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel . As a rule of thumb , Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30 % lower or more than gasoline , as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests .",

  "According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian , the public fascination with war films became an \" obsession \" , with over 200 war films produced in each decade of the 1950s and 1960s . War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid 1950s . Its popularity in the United Kingdom was brought on by the critical and commercial success of Charles Frend 's The Cruel Sea ( 1953 ) . Like others of the period , The Cruel Sea was based on a bestselling novel , in this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat 's story of the battle of the Atlantic . Others , like The Dam Busters ( 1954 ) , with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis 's unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music , were true stories . The Dam Busters became the most popular film in Britain in 1955 , and remained a favourite as of 2015 with a 100 % score on Rotten Tomatoes , though , partly because it celebrated an \" exclusively British [ victory ] \" , it failed to break into the American market . A large number of war films were made in the 1955 @-@ 58 period in particular . In 1957 alone , Bitter Victory , Count Five and Die , The Enemy Below , Ill Met by Moonlight , Jet Pilot , Men in War , The One That Got Away and Seven Thunders , and the highly successful , critically acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai , which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year , and Paths of Glory were released . Some , such as Bitter Victory , focused more on the psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events during the war . The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity to the war picture , with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war . By the end of the decade the \" sense of shared achievement \" which had been common in war films \" began to evaporate \" , according to Pulver .",

Miles is largely a reactionary figure throughout the book as he confronts struggles like registering for a charter school or dealing with family squabbles . \" Schedeen also opined that \" Miles occupies a more urban , racially diverse , and tense landscape . All the story doesn 't pander or lean too heavily on elements like racial and economic tension to move forward . Miles is simply a character who speaks to a slightly different teen experience , and one not nearly as well represented in superhero comics as Peter 's \" .

  "Castles , in the sense of a fortified residence of a lord or noble , arrived in Scotland as a consequence of the centralising of royal authority in the twelfth century . Prior to the 1120s there is very little evidence of castles having existed in Scotland , which had remained less politically centralised than in England with the north still ruled by the kings of Norway . David I of Scotland ( r . 1124 – 53 ) spent time at the court of Henry I of England , becoming Earl of Huntingdon , and returned to Scotland with the intention of extending royal power across the country and modernising Scotland 's military technology , including the introduction of castles . The Scottish king encouraged Norman and French nobles to settle in Scotland , introducing a feudal mode of landholding and the use of castles as a way of controlling the contested Scottish Lowlands . Historian Lise Hull has suggested that the creation of castles in Scotland was \" less to do with conquest \" and more to do with \" establishing a governing system \" .",

  "Beta decay ( and electron capture ) : these processes are regulated by the weak force , and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton , or a proton into a neutron . The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an antineutrino , while proton to neutron transition ( except in electron capture ) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino . The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles . Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one . Electron capture is more common than positron emission , because it requires less energy . In this type of decay , an electron is absorbed by the nucleus , rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus . A neutrino is still emitted in this process , and a proton changes to a neutron .",

When he returned to Rome , he told me what he 'd seen and his desire to narrate their hard lives on the road . ' It would make the ideal scenario for your next film , ' he said .

  "On a geologic timescale , the Willamette Valley has been the site of massive floods . During the late Wisconsin glaciation , a series of floods ( known as the Missoula or Bretz Floods ) occurred .

The actor goes on to say that Arthur is \" passionate about nature , about the earth , and about the seas \" , and is not afraid to use his abilities to save those things that are dear to him . When comparing his character to Clark , Ritchson stated that Arthur is more confident in his abilities , and already knows what he can do and what his path is in life . Another big difference the actor pointed out is that unlike Clark , Arthur is willing to sacrifice people and things if it means preserving the greater good . When he first appears , one of Victor Stone 's key characteristics is that both he and Clark can relate to the fact that they feel their abilities inhibit them from having a true relationship with the women they love . The writers tried to create parallels between the characters to emphasize this more , like Victor 's fear of telling his girlfriend the truth about what LuthorCorp did to his body , and Clark 's fear of Lana Lang discovering he is an alien . Writer Tracy Bellomo characterized Oliver as a guy that does not take himself very seriously , and enjoys making fun of people that try to take him that way .

This ' graphic ' kind of clarity can be most sharp when it is most jagged . \" The immediacy of the approach suited his desire to convey the primitive side of man 's nature . He was not the first to work in this manner ; Rembrandt had sought a similar directness , but did not have access to aquatint .

  "After any of the above approaches are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex , an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised . Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure 's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation . Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy , and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable , while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored .

  "As the difference between the two prices or quantities increases , the accuracy of the PED given by the formula above decreases for a combination of two reasons . First , the PED for a good is not necessarily constant ; as explained below , PED can vary at different points along the demand curve , due to its percentage nature . Elasticity is not the same thing as the slope of the demand curve , which is dependent on the units used for both price and quantity . Second , percentage changes are not symmetric ; instead , the percentage change between any two values depends on which one is chosen as the starting value and which as the ending value . For example , if quantity demanded increases from 10 units to 15 units , the percentage change is 50 % , i.e. , ( 15 − 10 ) ÷ 10 ( converted to a percentage ) . But if quantity demanded decreases from 15 units to 10 units , the percentage change is − 33 @.@ 3 % , i.e. , ( 10 − 15 ) ÷ 15 .",

  "C. Flotation of objects denser than water occurs when the object is nonwettable and its weight is small enough to be borne by the forces arising from surface tension . For example , water striders use surface tension to walk on the surface of a pond by the following way . Nonwettability of leg of the water strider means no attraction between molecules of the leg and molecules of the water , so when the leg pushes down the water , the surface tension of the water only tries to recover its flatness from its deformation due to the leg . This behavior of the water push the water strider upward so it can stand on the surface of the water as long as its mass is small enough so that the water can support it . The surface of the water behaves like an elastic film : the insect 's feet cause indentations in the water 's surface , increasing its surface area and tendency of minimization of surface curvature ( so area ) of the water pushes the insect 's feet upward .",

  "As the tunnels were constructed , they were generally supported by wooden beams and posts . Once the mine had been finished , the internal space was filled with combustibles , such as brushwood , firewood , resin , and other incendiary substances ; once ignited , these would burn the supporting props , causing the mine to collapse , bringing down with it the structures lying above . From the 15th century , gunpowder was also used , although the aim remained to burn the props .",
  "Australian ravens die most often by being shot or poisoned — generally by farmers . Despite their fondness for roadkill , fewer ravens are hit by vehicles than Australian magpies . Research in the 1950s and 60s showed that 64 % of Australian ravens perished in their first year of life . Immature birds are most at risk of dying as they are more likely to come into conflict with farmers . The Australian Raven is a peaceful bird , showing no aggression toward humans or other birds without reason . However , the Australian raven is frequently blamed for the loss of young lambs . Scientific observation in the country 's southeast showed that the killing of healthy lambs was rare , but that sick animals were predisposed to being attacked . Australian ravens mostly eat faeces ( often from the lamb 's anus ) , afterbirth or stillborn lambs . Newborn lamb faeces is nutritious , containing around 21 – 44 % protein , 9 – 37 % fat and 10 – 30 % carbohydrate . It has the consistency of treacle and often sticks to the lamb 's hindquarters or tail . The raven bites a sleeping lamb 's tail , holding on and walking behind it when it wakes up . A healthy lamb would respond by running away or butting the bird , but a sick one might not respond and be attacked further as it alerts the bird that it is vulnerable . Wounded lambs can also succumb to Clostridium infection as these bacteria are present on raven bills . Ravens bring some benefits to agricultural areas as they clean away carrion and eat insects that are potentially damaging to crops . In areas of Western Australia , the species is classified as a Declared Pest of Agriculture under the provisions of the Agriculture and Related Resources Protection Act 1976 , meaning that shooting on private land in rural areas is legal , although should be considered only after other options have been exhausted .",
  "Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) dreams of a red light that leads him to the corpse of a young girl buried in a park in Manassas , Virginia . When he awakens , he heads to the park and finds the girl 's skeleton . The girl was determined to have been murdered by John Lee Roche ( Tom Noonan ) , a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s ; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim . Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as a vacuum cleaner salesman . Roche 's hearts were never found , although he confessed to all of the murders .",
  "The fungus kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of taxa with varied ecologies , life cycle strategies , and morphologies ranging from unicellular aquatic chytrids to large mushrooms . However , little is known of the true biodiversity of Kingdom Fungi , which has been estimated at 1 @.@ 5 million to 5 million species , with about 5 % of these having been formally classified . Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century taxonomical works of Carl Linnaeus , Christian Hendrik Persoon , and Elias Magnus Fries , fungi have been classified according to their morphology ( e.g. , characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features ) or physiology . Advances in molecular genetics have opened the way for DNA analysis to be incorporated into taxonomy , which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits . Phylogenetic studies published in the last decade have helped reshape the classification within Kingdom Fungi , which is divided into one subkingdom , seven phyla , and ten subphyla .",

  "In 1897 , Hoffmann started working to find a less irritating substitute for salicylic acid . It is generally accepted that he turned to this idea because his father was suffering the side effects of taking sodium salicylate for rheumatism . Other chemists had attempted this before as well , by acetylating salicylic acid to make acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) . Charles Frédéric Gerhardt was the first to prepare acetylsalicylic acid in 1853 . In the course of his work on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides , he mixed acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid ( sodium salicylate ) . A vigorous reaction ensued , and the resulting melt soon solidified . Since no structural theory existed at that time Gerhardt called the compound he obtained \" salicylic @-@ acetic anhydride \" ( wasserfreie Salicylsäure @-@ Essigsäure ) . When Gerhardt tried to dissolve the solid in a diluted solution of sodium carbonate it immediately decomposed to sodium salts of salicylic and acetic acids . In 1859 , von Gilm produced ASA ( which he called \" acetylirte Salicylsäure \" , acetylated salicylic acid ) by a different method , the reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride . In 1869 Schröder , Prinzhorn and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt 's ( from sodium salicylate ) and von Gilm 's ( from salicylic acid ) syntheses and concluded that both reactions gave the same compound — acetylsalicylic acid . ( Prinzhorn is credited in the paper with conducting the experiments . ) They were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen . Kraut 's procedure was even being used by the drug company Heyden to make unbranded ASA . However , the published methods did not produce pure ASA — although Kraut 's method was efficient enough to be useful . It is likely that Hoffmann started by recreating the published methods . On October 10 , 1897 ( according to his laboratory notebooks ) , Hoffmann found a better method for making ASA , from salicylic acid refluxed with acetic anhydride .",

  "On 22 June 1941 , contravening the Hitler – Stalin Non @-@ Aggression Pact of 1939 , 4 – 5 million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union . This offensive ( codenamed Operation Barbarossa ) was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers . The invasion conquered a huge area , including the Baltic republics , Belarus , and West Ukraine . By early August , Axis troops had advanced 500 km ( 310 mi ) and won the Battle of Smolensk . Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to temporarily halt its advance to Moscow and divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev . His generals disagreed with this change , having advanced within 400 km ( 250 mi ) of Moscow , and his decision caused a crisis among the military leadership .

  "While the Yevon church forbids most machina including weapons , it retains machina weapons to ensure its dominance . The Al Bhed are seen as dangerous to the Yevon clergy because they use machina and pose a threat to the church 's uncontested control of Spira .

  "How the García Girls Lost Their Accents is rife with the constant presence of fear which manifests itself in a seemingly endless variety of outlets . Alvarez depicts quite vividly the fear evoked in the girls ' mother , Laura , near the chronological beginning of the book , as she \" sees the black V.W.

Even after the García family has spent several years in the United States , safe from the threat of Trujillo 's retribution , a relentless paranoia continues to plague Carlos , their father , \" who still lives in fear of the SIM and who is afraid to speak of ' revolt ' out loud \" . This initial fear of Carlos ' punishment for his role in the attempted assassination of Trujillo is what originally prompted the García family ’ s flight from the island and spawned the myriad other fears that would later plague their lives . The conflicted life the daughters would come to lead in the sexually liberated United States would be haunted by the fear of pregnancy and eternal damnation should they allow themselves to be seduced .",

Dunn commented that as the narrative developed , the child is shown singing , but the adult Madonna 's voice is heard , and when the adult Madonna appears in a hallway , her shadow is that of a child . Madonna responded to these observations by saying : \" I think the biggest reason I was able to express myself and not be intimidated was not having a mother . \" Dunn then moved onto the scene during the funeral , when the child trembled from seeing her mother 's lips sewn shut . Described by her as one of the most troubling shots in mainstream music videos , the scene was inspired by Madonna 's memory of her mother lying in her wake . The singer recalled in a 1991 interview with Vanity Fair , that she remembered that her mother 's lips looked funny in the funeral . When she got closer , she saw that Madonna Sr 's lips had been sewn together . This image of her mother had haunted Madonna for many years , and led her to comment that she never could resolve her Electra complex . The singer further explained :",
  "When Italy declared war on the Central Powers in May 1915 , the ship was assigned to the 5th Cruiser Division , based at Brindisi . On 5 June the division bombarded rail lines near Ragusa and departed Brindisi on the evening of 17 July to do the same near Ragusa Vecchia the following morning . Shortly after beginning the bombardment at 04 : 00 , Giuseppe Garibaldi was torpedoed by the Austro @-@ Hungarian submarine U @-@ 4 ; one torpedo passed between Varese and Giuseppe Garibaldi . Struck by a single torpedo , the cruiser sank within minutes , although only 53 crewmen were killed . The division immediately retreated to avoid further attacks , leaving three destroyers behind to rescue survivors . The loss of Giuseppe Garibaldi and the sinking of the armored cruiser Amalfi by another submarine on 7 July severely restricted the activities of the other ships based at Venice .",
  "The okapi can be easily distinguished from its nearest extant relative , the giraffe . It is much smaller and shares more external similarities with the deer and bovids than with the giraffe . While both sexes possess horns in the giraffe , only males bear horns in the okapi . The okapi has large palatine sinuses , unique among the giraffids . Morphological similarities shared between the giraffe and the okapi include a similar gait - both use a pacing gait , stepping simultaneously with the front and the hind leg on the same side of the body , unlike other ungulates that walk by moving alternate legs on either side of the body - and a long black tongue ( longer in the okapi ) useful in plucking buds and leaves as well as for grooming .",

At the end of the season , Wismer announced that Clyde \" Bulldog \" Turner would be the Titans ' head coach in 1962 . Baugh had a contract for 1962 and would have to be paid unless he quit . Although Wismer did not fire Baugh , he also did not tell him where the team 's 1962 training camp would be . Baugh showed up anyway , and spent several days acting as kicking coach before Wismer came to the conclusion that Baugh would not quit . The team owner finally agreed to pay the coach his 1962 salary in monthly installments , although Baugh later stated that he was never paid . Baugh 's 14 – 14 record stood as the best mark by any Titans / Jets coach until bettered by Bill Parcells in 1997 – 1999 .

It was reassigned to the genus Sarcoramphus in 1805 by French zoologist André Marie Constant Duméril . The generic name is a New Latin compound formed from the Greek words σάρξ ( sarx , \" flesh \" , the combining form of which is σαρκο- ) and ῥάμφος ( rhamphos , \" crooked beak of bird of prey \" ) . The genus name is often misspelled as Sarcorhamphus , improperly retaining the Greek rough breathing despite agglutination with the previous word @-@ element . The bird was also assigned to the genus Gyparchus by Constantin Wilhelm Lambert Gloger in 1841 , but this classification is not used in modern literature since Sarcoramphus has priority as the earlier name .

This is not the case for a close binary pulsar , a system of two orbiting neutron stars , one of which is a pulsar : from the pulsar , observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock , which allows precise measurements of the orbital period . Because neutron stars are immensely compact , significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation .",

  "An effect of the Civil War and resulting Commonwealth of England , particularly the \" liberal \" values and feelings it stirred up , was the continuous modernisation and improvement of the common law courts , something that reduced the interference of the Lord Chancellor in common law matters , except in areas where they had wildly divergent principles and law . Under Charles II , for the first time , there was a type of common law appeal where the nature of the evidence in the initial trial was taken into account , which reduced the need to go to the Court of Chancery . As a result , the nature of the Court of Chancery changed ; rather than being a major corrective system for the common law , it became primarily concerned with the administration and protection of rights , as opposed to the common law courts , which were mainly concerned with the remedy and retribution of problems . This was further enforced by the Statute of Frauds , which confirmed Chancery principles across the board , allowing people to receive the same treatment in the common law courts as they did in the Chancery .",

  "Rhythm games have been used for health purposes . For example , research has found that dancing games dramatically increase energy expenditure over that of traditional video games , and that they burn more calories than walking on a treadmill . Scientists have further suggested that , due to the large amount of time children spend playing video games and watching television , games that involve physical activity could be used to combat obesity . Studies have found that playing Dance Dance Revolution can provide an aerobic workout , in terms of a sufficiently intense heart rate , but not the minimum levels of VO2 max . Based on successful preliminary studies , West Virginia , which has one of the highest rates of obesity and its attendant diseases in the US , introduced Dance Dance Revolution into its schools ' physical education classes . According to The New York Times , more than \" several hundred schools in at least 10 states \" have used Dance Dance Revolution ( along with In the Groove ) in their curricula .

  "The noisy miner does not use a stereotyped courtship display ; displays can involve ' driving ' where the male jumps or flies at the female from 1 – 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 3 – 6 @.@ 6 ft ) away , and if she moves away he pursues her aggressively . The female may perform a ' bowed @-@ wing display ' where the wings and tail are spread and quivered , with the wings arched and the head pointing down . The male may adopt a vertical or horizontal ' eagle display ' with wings and tail spread wide and held still for several seconds . Copulation is frequent and conspicuous , with both males and females copulating with several birds , while other members of the colony display or otherwise interfere with the mating pair . Copulation usually occurs on larger , exposed branches close to the nest site and can occur at any time of the day , although slightly more often between 11 : 00 and 13 : 00 when communal activities are less frequent . The frenzied courtship activity had led to speculation that the female mates promiscuously to recruit males to help care for the young , but recent genetic testing shows that 96 @.@ 5 % of noisy miner broods result from monogamous mating and that multiple paternity is rare . An observation of banded birds noted that while females copulated repeatedly , it was always with the same male . Mate switching between broods is uncommon , with pairs staying together over several years .",

  "Starting with Justice for All , the series localization direction has been handled by Janet Hsu ; by the time she joined Capcom 's localization team in 2005 , the first Ace Attorney had already been localized , with the original localization team having decided to do a full localization , changing the setting from Japan to Los Angeles . While Hsu thought that this was the right choice to make , as it made the characters and dialogue more relatable and made for an emotional experience closer to what players of the Japanese version experience , it resulted in issues with each following game . According to the localization editor , Brandon Gay , Justice for All was one of their largest games to localize due to its focus on the story , and how it needs to convey the whole game world and its characters through just text ; this made it a challenge to make the characters relatable for an American audience . Another thing the localization team had to keep in mind was to ensure that recurring characters were consistent with how they behave in the first Ace Attorney . According to JP Kellams , another staff member working on the localization , there was a lot of pressure on them to make a good localization , as the first game 's localization had been well received ; he also felt that there was room for creativity due to the game 's style and subject , with room for humor that might not fit in other localizations . A lot of the humor in the original was based on Japanese wordplay ; these jokes had to be redone entirely for the English release . Hsu felt that the game was more demanding than previous projects she had worked on , as the localizers \" almost have to become [ the characters ] \" in order to get the nuance and motivations right due to their complexity .",

  "Miller 's influential book became , in the words of historian Charles Akers , the \" scholarly enshrinement \" of \" the myth of Sam Adams as the Boston dictator who almost single @-@ handedly led his colony into rebellion \" . According to Akers , Miller and others historians used \" Sam did it \" to explain crowd actions and other developments without citing any evidence that Adams directed those events . In 1974 , Akers called on historians to critically reexamine the sources rather than simply repeating the myth . By then , scholars were increasingly rejecting the notion that Adams and others used \" propaganda \" to incite \" ignorant mobs \" , and were instead portraying a revolutionary Massachusetts too complex to have been controlled by one man . Historian Pauline Maier argued that Adams , far from being a radical mob leader , took a moderate position based on the English revolutionary tradition that imposed strict constraints on resistance to authority . That belief justified force only against threats to the constitutional rights so grave that the \" body of the people \" recognized the danger , and only after all peaceful means of redress had failed . Within that revolutionary tradition , resistance was essentially conservative . In 2004 , Ray Raphael 's Founding Myths continued Maier 's line by deconstructing several of the \" Sam \" Adams myths that are still repeated in many textbooks and popular histories .",

  "The regions active during engagement of cognitive flexibility depend on the task and various factors involved in flexibility that are used to assess the behavior , as flexible thinking requires aspects of inhibition , attention , working memory , response selection , and goal maintenance . Several studies using task switching paradigms have demonstrated the complexities of the network involved in cognitive flexibility . Activation of the dorsolateral PFC has been shown during resolution of interference of irrelevant task sets . Another study further extended these results by demonstrating that the level of abstractness of the switch type influenced recruitment of differing regions in the PFC depending on whether the participant was asked to make a cognitive set switch , a response switch , or a stimulus or perceptual switch . A set switch would require switching between task rules , as with the WCST , and is considered to be the most abstract . A response switch would require different response mapping , such as circle right button and square left button and vice versa . Lastly , a stimulus or perceptual set switch would require a simple switch between a circle and a square . Activation is mediated by the level of abstractness of the set switch in an anterior to posterior fashion within the PFC , with the most anterior activations elicited by set switches and the most posterior activations resulting from stimulus or perceptual switches . The basal ganglia is active during response selection and the PPC , along with the inferior frontal junction are active during representation and updating of task sets called domain general switching .",

  "Victoria Cross recipient Cecil Meritt cited the fact that he already held Canada 's highest decoration as a reason not to be admitted to the Order of Canada . Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , was in 1982 offered appointment to the order as an honorary Companion ; however , he refused on the grounds that , as the consort of the Queen , he was a Canadian and thus entitled to a substantive appointment . In 1993 , the Advisory Council proposed an amendment to the constitution of the Order of Canada , making the sovereign 's spouse automatically a Companion , but Prince Philip again refused , stating that if he was to be appointed , it should be on his merits . Congruent with these arguments , he in 1988 accepted without issue a substantive induction as a Companion of the Order of Australia . In 2013 , the constitution of the Order of Canada was amended in a way that permitted the substantive appointment of Royal Family members and Prince Philip accepted induction as the first extraordinary Companion of the Order of Canada on 26 April 2013 .

  "Shortly after the Card was sunk , North Vietnam made full use of the incident for propaganda purposes . On October 20 , 1964 , the North Vietnamese government issued a postage stamp which proclaimed an \" Aircraft Carrier of America sunk in the Harbor of Saigon \" , to praise the Viet Cong commandos who carried out the attack . The U.S. Navy refused to admit the Card had been sunk even for a brief period of time , instead it simply stated the Card was damaged and quickly repaired . For the remainder of 1964 , the Viet Cong launched further attacks on U.S. targets such as the Brinks Hotel and Bien Hoa Air Base , but there were no significant responses from the U.S. military .

  "Until Grant McColley , a historian of early Modern English literature , published his \" The Date of Godwin 's Domingo Gonsales \" in 1937 , it was thought that Godwin wrote The Man in the Moone relatively early in his life — perhaps during his time at Christ Church from 1578 to 1584 , or maybe even as late as 1603 . But McColley proposed a much later date of 1627 or 1628 , based on internal and biographical evidence . A number of ideas about the physical properties of the Earth and the Moon , including claims about \" a secret property that operates in a manner similar to that of a loadstone attracting iron \" , did not appear until after 1620 . And Godwin seems to borrow the concept of using a flock of strong , trained birds to fly Gonsales to the Moon from Francis Bacon 's Sylva sylvarum ( \" Natural History \" ) , published in July 1626 . All this evidence supports McColley 's dating of \" 1626 – 29 , with the probable years of composition 1627 – 28 \" , which is now generally accepted .",

  "Senators had an aura of prestige and were the traditional governing class who rose through the cursus honorum , the political career track , but equestrians of the Empire often possessed greater wealth and political power .

  "\" Hush \" explores issues relating to the limits and benefits of language and communication . During the first act of the episode , the characters are presented as being overwhelmed by language that is misused , used as white noise , and employed as a means of avoiding truth . Many of the conversations between characters , even those that are seemingly insignificant to the episode 's plot or to the show 's overall history , deal in some way with various aspects or forms of communication . Whedon stated that he was unaware of how \" inevitably coherent \" this theme was until after the script was completed . Buffy and Riley are unable to act upon their attraction because they cannot stop babbling , primarily to keep their true identities concealed from each other , but also to avoid becoming closer emotionally . Xander is unable or unwilling to express what Anya means to him , and Anya , still new at interacting with humans , uses blunt , often rude language that distances herself from all the other characters .

  "Tuberculosis has been present in humans since antiquity . The earliest unambiguous detection of M. tuberculosis involves evidence of the disease in the remains of bison in Wyoming dated to around 17 @,@ 000 years ago . However , whether tuberculosis originated in bovines , then was transferred to humans , or whether it diverged from a common ancestor , is currently unclear . A comparison of the genes of M. tuberculosis complex ( MTBC ) in humans to MTBC in animals suggests humans did not acquire MTBC from animals during animal domestication , as was previously believed . Both strains of the tuberculosis bacteria share a common ancestor , which could have infected humans even before the Neolithic Revolution .",

  "The attachment behavioural system serves to achieve or maintain proximity to the attachment figure . Pre @-@ attachment behaviours occur in the first six months of life . During the first phase ( the first eight weeks ) , infants smile , babble , and cry to attract the attention of potential caregivers . Although infants of this age learn to discriminate between caregivers , these behaviours are directed at anyone in the vicinity . During the second phase ( two to six months ) , the infant increasingly discriminates between familiar and unfamiliar adults , becoming more responsive toward the caregiver ; following and clinging are added to the range of behaviours . Clear @-@ cut attachment develops in the third phase , between the ages of six months and two years . The infant 's behaviour toward the caregiver becomes organized on a goal @-@ directed basis to achieve the conditions that make it feel secure . By the end of the first year , the infant is able to display a range of attachment behaviours designed to maintain proximity . These manifest as protesting the caregiver 's departure , greeting the caregiver 's return , clinging when frightened , and following when able . With the development of locomotion , the infant begins to use the caregiver or caregivers as a \" safe base \" from which to explore . Infant exploration is greater when the caregiver is present because the infant 's attachment system is relaxed and it is free to explore . If the caregiver is inaccessible or unresponsive , attachment behaviour is more strongly exhibited . Anxiety , fear , illness , and fatigue will cause a child to increase attachment behaviours .",

Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically , by reversing the wiring polarity , or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward .

  "In addition to chemical changes in cells , structural changes that lead to epilepsy may occur in the brain . Seizures that occur shortly after TBI can reorganize neural networks and cause seizures to occur repeatedly and spontaneously later on . The kindling hypothesis suggests that new neural connections are formed in the brain and cause an increase in excitability . The word kindling is a metaphor : the way the brain 's response to stimuli increases over repeated exposures is similar to the way small burning twigs can produce a large fire . This reorganization of neural networks may make them more excitable . Neurons that are in a hyperexcitable state due to trauma may create an epileptic focus in the brain that leads to seizures . In addition , an increase in neurons ' excitability may accompany loss of inhibitory neurons that normally serve to reduce the likelihood that other neurons will fire ; these changes may also produce PTE .",

  "The Doni Tondo is believed to be the only existing panel picture Michelangelo painted without the aid of assistants ; and , unlike his Manchester Madonna and Entombment ( both National Gallery , London ) , the attribution to him has never been questioned . The juxtaposition of bright colors foreshadows the same use of color in Michelangelo ’ s later Sistine ceiling frescoes . The folds of the drapery are sharply modeled , and the skin of the figures is so smooth , it looks as if the medium is marble . The surface treatment of the massive figures resembles a sculpture more than a painting . The nude figures in the background have softer modeling and look to be precursors to the ignudi , the male nude figures in the Sistine Ceiling frescoes . Michelangelo ’ s technique includes shading from the most intense colors first to the lighter shades on top , using the darker colors as shadows , a technique called cangiante . By applying the pigment in a certain way , Michelangelo created an \" unfocused \" effect in the background and focused detail in the foreground . The most vibrant color is located within the Virgin ’ s garments , signifying her importance within the image . X @-@ rays of the painting show that Michelangelo incorporated every known pigment used at the time .

  "Keats 's use of the odal hymn in his six odes , along with his use of the odal hymn with a responsal voice in \" Ode to a Grecian Urn \" and \" Ode to a Nightingale \" , created , according to Walter Jackson Bate , \" a new tone for the English lyric . \" Bate , when speaking about the 1819 odes , wrote : \" The productivity of the three and a half weeks that begins on April 21 is difficult to parallel in the career of any modern writer . Yet to Keats it was not even a new beginning .

We need not be afraid of continuing to use the adjective [ ... ] The ' Ode to a Nightingale , ' for example , is a less ' perfect ' though a greater poem . \" Charles Patterson argued the relationship of \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" as the greatest 1819 ode of Keats , \" The meaningfulness and range of the poem , along with its controlled execution and powerfully suggestive imagery , entitle it to a high place among Keats 's great odes . It lacks the even finish and extreme perfection of \" To Autumn \" but is much superior in these qualities to the \" Ode to a Nightingale \" despite the magic passages in the latter and the similarities of over @-@ all structure . In fact , the \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" may deserve to rank first in the group if viewed in something approaching its true complexity and human wisdom . \" Later , Ayumi Mizukoshi argued that early audiences did not support \" Ode to Psyche \" because it \" turned out to be too reflexive and internalised to be enjoyed as a mythological picture . For the same reason , the \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" drew neither attention nor admiration . Herbert Grierson believed \" Nightingale \" to be superior to the other odes because it and \" To Autumn \" were more logical and contained stronger arguments .

The regular creation of knights of Saint Patrick lasted until 1922 , when most of Ireland became independent as the Irish Free State . While the Order technically still exists , no knight of St Patrick has been created since 1936 , and the last surviving knight , Prince Henry , Duke of Gloucester , died in 1974 . The Queen , however , remains the Sovereign of the Order , and one officer , the Ulster King of Arms ( now combined with Norroy King of Arms ) , also survives . St Patrick is patron of the order ; its motto is Quis separabit ? , Latin for \" Who will separate [ us ] ? \" : an allusion to the Vulgate translation of Romans 8 : 35 , \" Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? \"",
  "In 1960 , there was extensive flooding of the Rother Valley , with some 31 square miles ( 80 km2 ) inundated , and in some areas the water did not recede for several months . In 1962 the Kent River Board introduced a bill to Parliament , which would authorise improvements to the river banks , with the construction of a sluice and associated lock below Rye , to prevent tidal flooding . At the time , the river was used by a fishing fleet of at least ten trawlers , and a freighter of 250 tons used the river for a trade in timber . There was some concern in the House of Lords that the lock would not be large enough to accommodate the freighter , although it would be possible to open both sets of lock gates when the tide level was suitable . The bill did not become an Act of Parliament , due to lack of parliamentary time , and so the sluice was not constructed . However , the Rother Area Drainage Improvement Scheme began in 1966 , and was completed in 1980 . This involved raising the level of the floodbanks along much of the river . Those in the Wet Level , an area of 690 acres ( 280 ha ) between the junction with the Maytham Sewer and Blackwall Bridge , were not raised as much , so that during periods of high flow when the river is tide @-@ locked , the levels can be used for flood storage . The scheme included the installation of 20 pumping stations , which raise water from the low @-@ lying marshes into the embanked river using Archimedes ' screw pumps . Some of the drainage ditches in the marshland had to be reconfigured to deliver the water to the pumping stations .",
  "Holland @-@ Dozier @-@ Holland left Motown in early 1968 after a dispute with the label over royalties and profit sharing . The quality of Motown 's output ( and Diana Ross & the Supremes ' records in particular ) began to falter as a result . From \" Reflections \" in 1967 to \" The Weight \" in 1969 , only six out of the eleven released singles reached the Top 20 , and only one of those , 1968 's \" Love Child \" , made it to number one . Due to the tension within the group and stringent touring schedules , neither Mary Wilson nor Cindy Birdsong appear on many of these singles ; they were replaced on these recordings by session singers such as the Andantes . The changes within the group and their decreasing sales were signs of changes within the music industry . The gospel @-@ based soul of female performers such as Aretha Franklin had eclipsed the Supremes ' pop @-@ based sound , which had by now evolved to include more middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road material .

  "Since her death , McClintock has been the subject of a biography by the science historian Nathaniel C. Comfort 's The Tangled Field : Barbara McClintock 's Search for the Patterns of Genetic Control . Comfort 's biography contests some claims about McClintock , described as the \" McClintock Myth \" , which he claims was perpetuated by the earlier biography by Keller . Keller 's thesis was that McClintock was long ignored or met with derision because she was a woman working in the sciences . For example , when McClintock presented her findings that the genetics of maize did not conform to Mendelian distributions , geneticist Sewall Wright expressed the belief that she did not understand the underlying mathematics of her work , a belief he had expressed towards other women at the time . In addition , geneticist Lotte Auerbach recounted that Joshua Lederberg returned from a visit to McClintock 's lab with the remark : ' By God , that woman is either crazy or a genius . ' \" As Auerbach tells it , McClintock had thrown Lederberg and his colleagues out after half an hour ' because of their arrogance . She was intolerant of arrogance ...
