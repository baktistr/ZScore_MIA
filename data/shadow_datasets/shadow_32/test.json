  "On March 21 , a tropical disturbance quickly developed in the monsoon trough in the south @-@ central Indian Ocean , about 1250 km ( 775 mi ) east of Diego Garcia . A ridge to the south steered the system to the west @-@ southwest , and moderate wind shear in the region prevented significant strengthening . The convection slowly organized , and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Ikala early on March 25 . By that time , the shear had decreased , although initially it was strong enough to prevent the convection from covering the center . An approaching cold front turned the storm to the southeast on March 25 , where upper @-@ level conditions became more favorable for strengthening . Thunderstorms increased over the center , and an eye began developing on March 26 . The next day , Ikala intensified into a tropical cyclone , reaching peak winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) according to MFR ; the JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) . Shortly after peaking , increased wind shear and drier air from the front quickly weakened Ikala , and it deteriorated below tropical cyclone status on March 28 . That day , the center became exposed from the convection , and on March 29 Ikala became extratropical . The remnants turned to the southwest before recurving to the southeast on March 31 , and Ikala was absorbed by a cold front on April 3 .",

  "The following is a list of Grossman 's statistics from his regular and postseason games . Grossman has occasionally recorded notable statistics ; among all quarterbacks during the 2006 season , Grossman ranked tenth in number of pass attempts , seventh in touchdowns thrown , and third in interceptions . He completed his first full season with a 73 @.@ 9 quarterback rating . This was better than quarterback ratings of Favre , Peyton Manning , and Terry Bradshaw during their first full seasons ; many other quarterbacks have performed similarly or better in their first years , including Grossman 's former backup Brian Griese . His twenty @-@ three touchdowns in one season rank Grossman among the best Bears quarterbacks in the franchise ’ s history . However , his twenty interceptions in one season are among the most thrown by any Bears ’ quarterback in almost two decades .

As the North Vietnamese attempted to turn the captured mortars against the Australians , the flechette darts swept the area , clearing everything above ground , causing heavy casualties among the assaulting force and damaging a number of mortar tubes . Elsewhere , the North Vietnamese assault had reached the Australian gun position , over @-@ running two guns as desperate close quarters fighting broke out between the emplacements . The attackers subsequently succeeded in capturing No. 6 gun on the extreme edge of the gun @-@ line and then attempted to destroy it with satchel charges . In both the mortar and artillery positions the North Vietnamese and Australians occupied adjacent pits , fighting each other at close range for their possession . The gun position officer — Captain Ian Ahearn — co @-@ ordinated the defence , and the Australians finally drove off the assault with grenades and small arms , as well as Splintex rounds fired from the Anti @-@ Tank Platoon . Meanwhile , with the assault falling mainly on 1 RAR and 102nd Field Battery , to the west 3 RAR had largely remained out of contact .",

  "Suspicion was fuelled to some degree by her entertainment of questionable characters at court - for example , the reputed seer Nostradamus , who was rumoured to have created a talisman for Catherine , made from a mixture of metals , goat blood and human blood . Catherine also gave patronage to the Ruggeri brothers , who were renowned astrologers , but were also known for their involvement in necromancy and the black arts . Cosimo Ruggeri , in particular , was believed to be Catherine 's own \" trusted necromancer , and specialist in the dark arts \" , although there is not a great deal of surviving documentation to tell of his life . Though some suggest that they were simply magicians , for many living in Italy at the time , the distinction between ' magician ' and ' witch ' was unclear .

  "The Ministry of Supervision ( MOS ) was established by the State Council in 1987 to supervise in \" government departments , state organs and public officials , and maintaining administrative discipline . \" Since its inception , the MOS ' jurisdiction was unclear ; most government personnel , as party officials , were under the purview of the CCDI . Before 1987 , the CCDI was responsible for issuing administrative sanctions to public officials ; since it enforced party discipline and the MOS enforced state law , in theory \" the two agencies operated in separate spheres \" . The reality was less clear @-@ cut ; most public servants were party members , and the MOS and CCDI customarily began separate investigations of the same person . In these dual investigations , the CDIs ( and sometimes the CCDI ) claimed primary jurisdiction over cases involving important party figures and tried to prevent the MOS from doing its work . To solve this problem , the MOS and the CCDI were effectively merged in 1993 – 1994 ; although their organisational identities remained separate , the internal offices of the MOS merged with the CCDI . Since then , the CCDI has conducted the work of the MOS ; the Minister of Supervision customarily holds the concurrent post of Deputy Secretary of the CCDI , and the organisations share a website .",

Okabe served as the lead composer and as the director for the project as a whole .

Some tracks were used in ways that the composers did not envision , such as \" Grandma \" , which was expected to be used in the prologue of the game but was instead chosen as a boss battle theme .

  "The myth of Actaeon is known to have been narrated in the Catalogue by virtue of a paraphrase found in a fragmentary dictionary of metamorphoses . According to the dictionary , the Catalogue included a variant of the myth in which Actaeon was changed into a stag by Artemis and then killed by his own hounds because he attempted to take Semele as his wife , thus angering Zeus , who had designs upon the woman . Before this testimonium appeared , another papyrus containing 21 hexameters related to the Actaeon myth was published by Edgar Lobel , who tentatively attributed the text to the Catalogue . As the fragment opens , Actaeon has already been torn apart by his dogs , and a goddess — Athena or , less likely , Artemis — arrives at Chiron 's cave . She prophesies to the centaur that Dionysus will be born to Semele and that Actaeon 's dogs will roam the hills with him until his apotheosis , after which they will return to stay with Chiron . At this point the papyrus is damaged , but it is clear that the dogs are delivered from a \" madness \" ( λύσσα , lussa , line 15 ) and begin to mourn their master as the goddess returns to Olympus . Merkelbach and West did not include this papyrus in their edition of the fragment , the latter calling it an \" incoherent epic pastiche \" which would cause the author of the Catalogue to \" turn in his grave if he knew that it had been attributed to him . \" According to Glenn Most , some scholars believe that the text is Hellenistic , but it is demonstrably archaic , and at least a few classicists today consider it to be part of the Catalogue .",

  "Entrepreneurs sought to capitalize on the wealth generated by the Gold Rush . Early winners were the banking industry , with the founding of Wells Fargo in 1852 and the Bank of California in 1864 . Development of the Port of San Francisco and the establishment in 1869 of overland access to the Eastern U.S. rail system via the newly completed Pacific Railroad ( the construction of which the city only reluctantly helped support ) helped make the Bay Area a center for trade . Catering to the needs and tastes of the growing population , Levi Strauss opened a dry goods business and Domingo Ghirardelli began manufacturing chocolate . Immigrant laborers made the city a polyglot culture , with Chinese Railroad Workers , drawn to \" Old Gold Mountain \" , creating the city 's Chinatown quarter . In 1870 , Asians made up 8 % of the population . The first cable cars carried San Franciscans up Clay Street in 1873 . The city 's sea of Victorian houses began to take shape , and civic leaders campaigned for a spacious public park , resulting in plans for Golden Gate Park .

Many lemur species , such as sifakas and the ring @-@ tailed lemur , have scored lower on tests designed for monkeys while performing as well as monkeys on other tests . These comparisons may not be fair since lemurs prefer to manipulate objects with their mouths ( rather than their hands ) and only take interest in objects when in captivity .

  "So far some success has been achieved in using string theory methods to describe the transition of a superfluid to an insulator . A superfluid is a system of electrically neutral atoms that flows without any friction . Such systems are often produced in the laboratory using liquid helium , but recently experimentalists have developed new ways of producing artificial superfluids by pouring trillions of cold atoms into a lattice of criss @-@ crossing lasers . These atoms initially behave as a superfluid , but as experimentalists increase the intensity of the lasers , they become less mobile and then suddenly transition to an insulating state . During the transition , the atoms behave in an unusual way . For example , the atoms slow to a halt at a rate that depends on the temperature and on Planck 's constant , the fundamental parameter of quantum mechanics , which does not enter into the description of the other phases . This behavior has recently been understood by considering a dual description where properties of the fluid are described in terms of a higher dimensional black hole .",

  "A number of foods and substances have been found to disturb sleep , due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands . Avoiding nicotine , caffeine ( including coffee , energy drinks , soft drinks , tea , chocolate , and some pain relievers ) , and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists , as these substances activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness . Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians , because , although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially , the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep . Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one 's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep , leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness . Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime , requiring effort to metabolize it all , and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep ; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime . Lastly , limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations .",

After an argument with the producers , Freda left the production allowing Mario Bava to step in to finish the film in the next two days . Reasons for Freda leaving production differ , and range from Freda having a misunderstanding with the producers , to Bava stating that Freda was taking too long to make the film .

  "Mirella D ’ Ancona argues that the image reflects Michelangelo ’ s views on the roles of the members of the Holy Family in human salvation and the soul ’ s immortality . The Virgin ’ s placement and emphasis is due to her role in human salvation . She is both the mother of Christ and the best intercessor for appealing to him . Michelangelo , who had been strongly influenced by the Dominican Fra Girolamo Savonarola in Florence , is using the picture to defend the Maculist point of view , a philosophy of the Dominican order rejecting the idea of the Immaculate Conception of Mary . The Maculist view is that the Virgin did not receive her sanctification at birth but at the moment of the incarnation of Christ ; thus , the image depicts the moment of Mary ’ s sanctification by showing the Christ Child blessing her . Michelangelo depicts Christ as if he is growing out of Mary ’ s shoulder to take human form , one leg hanging limply and the other not visible at all , therefore making him a part of Mary . Moreover , his muscles and balance convey an upward movement , as if he is growing out of her , although he is above Mary , asserting his superiority to her . Furthermore , she argues that the nudes are to be interpreted as sinners who have removed their clothes for cleansing and purification through baptism . The water , which separates the sinners from the Holy Family , just beyond the horizontal band in the middle of the painting , can therefore be seen as the “ waters of separation ” mentioned in the Bible . She also argues that the five figures may represent the five parts of the soul : the higher soul ( soul and intellect ) on the left and the lower soul ( imagination , sensation , and nourishing faculty ) on the right , a visual depiction of the views of Marsilio Ficino , whom Michelangelo references in other works . Additionally , in looking at them as separate groupings , she suggest that the two figures on Mary ’ s right represents the human and divine natures of Christ , while the three on her left represent the Trinity .",

  "Historians debate whether or not Washington preferred a Fabian strategy to harass the British with quick , sharp attacks followed by a retreat so the larger British army could not catch him , or whether he preferred to fight major battles .

  "Disturbance is important in the creation of biodiverse habitats . In the absence of disturbance , a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species . Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years in the absence of patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow . Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created . Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away , or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation . Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat .",

  "Lichens are a symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria . The algae partner in the relationship is referred to in lichen terminology as a \" photobiont \" . The fungi part of the relationship are composed mostly of various species of ascomycetes and a few basidiomycetes . Lichens occur in every ecosystem on all continents , play a key role in soil formation and the initiation of biological succession , and are the dominating life forms in extreme environments , including polar , alpine , and semiarid desert regions . They are able to grow on inhospitable surfaces , including bare soil , rocks , tree bark , wood , shells , barnacles and leaves . As in mycorrhizas , the photobiont provides sugars and other carbohydrates via photosynthesis to the fungus , while the fungus provides minerals and water to the photobiont . The functions of both symbiotic organisms are so closely intertwined that they function almost as a single organism ; in most cases the resulting organism differs greatly from the individual components . Lichenization is a common mode of nutrition for fungi ; around 20 % of fungi — between 17 @,@ 500 and 20 @,@ 000 described species — are lichenized . Characteristics common to most lichens include obtaining organic carbon by photosynthesis , slow growth , small size , long life , long @-@ lasting ( seasonal ) vegetative reproductive structures , mineral nutrition obtained largely from airborne sources , and greater tolerance of desiccation than most other photosynthetic organisms in the same habitat .",

  "In January 1943 , the 29th Brigade was deployed to New Guinea to serve as garrison troops in areas that had been recently secured by Allied forces . The 15th Battalion was initially sent to Milne Bay , remaining there for six months . It moved to Buna in July , but did not remain there long , transferring to Morobe a few weeks later . While there , the battalion 's commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel Jack Amies , appealed to the battalion to volunteer for service as part of the AIF . While some already had , the majority of the men were still classified as Militia personnel , which meant that the battalion was restricted in where it could serve and was liable to be broken up . To be classified as an AIF battalion , under the provisions of the newly passed Defence ( Citizen Military Forces ) Act 1943 , 65 per cent or more of the personnel had to volunteer for service outside Australian territory . The response was considerable and , by August , the battalion was gazetted as an AIF battalion . Later that month , as the Australians fought to secure Komiatum , the battalion moved on barges to Nassau Bay , and was committed to combat for the first time , occupying a position around Mount Tambu , known as \" Davidson 's Ridge \" , before marching to Tambu Bay . Arriving on 23 August , the battalion was initially placed into divisional reserve , as the 29th Brigade was committed to the drive on Salamaua .",

The Arabs captured the Byzantine camp and took all the provisions they had brought along for the beleaguered city , allowing them to continue the siege . The inhabitants of Tyana now despaired of any succour , and as their own supplies dwindled they began negotiations for a surrender .

  "In the Early Iron Age , Maiden Castle was generally unexceptional ; it was one of over 100 hill forts of similar size built around the same time in the area that is now Berkshire , Dorset , Hampshire , and Wiltshire . In the Middle Iron Age , Maiden Castle was expanded and in the process it became the largest hill fort in Britain and one of the largest in Europe . According to archaeologist Niall Sharples it is , by some definitions , in fact the largest in western Europe . In about 450 BC , Maiden Castle was expanded from 6 @.@ 4 to 19 ha ( 16 to 47 acres ) . The area was initially enclosed by a single bank and ditch , with the bank standing 2 @.@ 7 m ( 8 @.@ 9 ft ) high although the ditch was shallow . The hill fort 's expansion was not unique ; it was one of a series of \" developed hill forts \" in southern England . As some hill forts were expanded , many of the smaller hill forts that had proliferated in the Early Iron Age fell out of use , as was the case in Dorset . The developed hill forts in Dorset were spaced widely apart . This , and the abandonment of the smaller hill forts in the area when the developed hill forts were built , indicates that these developed hill forts were important . The developed hill forts of Berkshire , Dorset , Hampshire , and Wiltshire were equally spaced apart , with roughly equal access to resources such as water .",

From January 1940 , all unmarried men turning 21 were required to report to be examined for potential service . While a substantial proportion of these men were granted exemptions on medical grounds or because they would suffer financial hardship if forced to enter the military , the remainder were liable for three months training followed by ongoing reserve service . A side effect of this arrangement was the creation of two different armies with different conditions of service , one the part @-@ volunteer part @-@ conscript Militia and the other the all @-@ volunteer AIF .

  "As German film professor Anton Kaes wrote , \" The style of German Expressionism allowed the filmmakers to experiment with filmic technology and special effects and to explore the twisted realm of repressed desires , unconscious fears , and deranged fixations \" . The visual style of Caligari conveys a sense of anxiety and terror to the viewer , giving the impression of a nightmare or deranged sensibility , or a place transformed by evil , in a more effective way than realistic locations or conventional design concepts could . Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the settings \" amounted to a perfect transformation of material objects into emotional ornaments \" . The majority of the film 's story and scenes are memories recalled by an insane narrator , and as a result the distorted visual style takes on the quality of his mental breakdown , giving the viewers the impression that they are inside the mind of a madman . As with German Expressionist paintings , the visual style of Caligari reflects an emotional reaction to world , and in the case of the film 's characters represents an emotional response to the terror of society that Dr. Caligari and Cesare represent . Often in the film , set pieces are emblematic of the emotional state of the characters in the scene . For example , the courtyard of the insane asylum during the frame story is vastly out of proportion . The characters seem too big for the small building , and the courtyard floor features a bizarre pattern , all of which represent the patients ' damaged frames of mind . Likewise , the scene with the criminal in a prison cell features a set with long vertical painted shadows resembling arrowheads , pointing down at the squatting prisoner in an oppressive effect that symbolizes his broken @-@ down state .",

The female 's mantle protrudes from the shell and develops into an imitation small fish , complete with fish @-@ like markings and false eyes . This decoy moves in the current and attracts the attention of real fish . Some fish see the decoy as prey , while others see a conspecific . They approach for a closer look and the mussel releases huge numbers of larvae from its gills , dousing the inquisitive fish with its tiny , parasitic young . These glochidia larvae are drawn into the fish 's gills , where they attach and trigger a tissue response that forms a small cyst around each larva . The larvae then feed by breaking down and digesting the tissue of the fish within the cysts . After a few weeks they release themselves from the cysts and fall to the stream bed as juvenile molluscs . The fish are relatively unharmed .",

  "The adoption of Middle Scots by the aristocracy has been seen as building a shared sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled , although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands . The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history in the service of the Crown and nationalism , helping to foster a sense of national identity at least within its elite audience . The epic poetic history of the Brus and Wallace helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy . Arthurian literature differed from conventional version of the legend by treating Arthur as a villain and Mordred , the son of the king of the Picts , as a hero . The origin myth of the Scots , systematised by John of Fordun ( c . 1320 @-@ c . 1384 ) , traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota , allowing them to argue superiority over the English , who claimed their descent from the Trojans , who had been defeated by the Greeks .",

Vice Admiral Tochinai Sojiro , who arrived aboard Tokiwa , relieved Moriyama who was due to return home .

It also shifted airfields from Veurne in Belgium to Chipilly in France , leaving behind RNAS control by transferring to No. 14 Wing , 4th Brigade of the RFC . Formation flying became the order of the day , as the practice of fighter pilots soloing into combat dwindled . The last three weeks of March were also filled with Dallas 's responsibilities for flight and gunnery testing . As British losses in the air began to mount during Bloody April , Dallas and his squadron moved airfields once again , to La Bellevue . They were thus positioned to take a prominent part in the subsequent Battle of Arras , where the intense aerial fighting saw Dallas add to his burgeoning score . The combat of 23 April became known as one of the classic air battles of the war . Dallas and his wingman Thomas Culling took on a squadron @-@ sized formation of 14 German aircraft , having gained an altitude edge over their foes . The naval aces exploited this edge by making quick diving attacks from opposite sides , culminating in short bursts of machine @-@ gun fire . Using the Triplane 's superior climbing ability , they would then bob back up to position themselves for the next assault . In contrast to the usual hit @-@ and @-@ run tactics of most dogfights , the RNAS duo launched at least 20 gunnery runs over 45 minutes . The Germans were forced progressively lower , into disarray , and then chased back over their own lines . While they shot down three of the Germans , Dallas and Culling also achieved a more important outcome by blocking and then breaking up a determined enemy effort against the British ground offensive . The action led to the award of a Bar to the Distinguished Service Cross for Dallas , and a Distinguished Service Cross for Culling , which were gazetted on 29 June .",

  "One of the key developments in memorials to the war , the cenotaph , used an empty tomb to symbolise these aspects of the war . In 1919 , Britain and France planned victory marches through their respective capitals and as part of this France decided to erect a temporary cenotaph , an empty sarcophagus monument , which would be saluted by the marching troops . The British Prime Minister David Lloyd George decided that a similar memorial should be built in London , despite ministerial opposition that a cenotaph was an inappropriate , Catholic form of monument . The victory marches went ahead ; French political leaders had the memorial in Paris removed immediately after the parade , on the basis that it was too Germanic in appearance , but the London cenotaph proved very popular and hundreds of thousands flocked to see it . The popularity of the temporary Cenotaph resulted in it remaining open until the following year , when the decision had to be taken about what to do with the decaying structure : there was concern from the government that a permanent memorial might be vandalised , while the popular press criticised any suggestion of dismantling the existing structure . A new , permanent cenotaph designed by Edwin Lutyens was commissioned and unveiled on Whitehall Street on Armistice Day 1920 , effectively turning this part of London into a memorial to the war ; over a million people visited the site during November that year . The memorial style became very popular and spread to other countries in the subsequent years .",
  "The main toxic substance found in the parotoid gland and skin of the common toad is called bufotoxin .

  "In cases of serious poisoning the mushroom causes delirium , somewhat similar in effect to anticholinergic poisoning ( such as that caused by Datura stramonium ) , characterised by bouts of marked agitation with confusion , hallucinations , and irritability followed by periods of central nervous system depression . Seizures and coma may also occur in severe poisonings . Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours , but certain effects can last for several days . In the majority of cases recovery is complete within 12 to 24 hours . The effect is highly variable between individuals , with similar doses potentially causing quite different reactions . Some people suffering intoxication have exhibited headaches up to ten hours afterwards . Retrograde amnesia and somnolence can result following recovery .",

  "One possible explanation for the origin of hooden was that it had emerged as a mispronunciation of wooden , referring to the use of the wooden horse . Maylam was critical of this idea , expressing the view that such a mispronunciation was unlikely to emerge from the Kentish dialect . A second possibility is that the name hooden was a reference to the hooded nature of the horse 's bearer . The historian Ronald Hutton deemed this to be the \" simplest \" derivation , while folklorists Charlotte Sophia Burne and E. C. Cawte also considered it the most likely explanation .

  "The longevity of Augustus ' reign and its legacy to the Roman world should not be overlooked as a key factor in its success . As Tacitus wrote , the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate . Had Augustus died earlier ( in 23 BC , for instance ) , matters might have turned out differently . The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the longevity of Augustus , therefore , must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years . Augustus ' own experience , his patience , his tact , and his political acumen also played their parts . He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths , from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers , to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession , to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor 's expense . Augustus ' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated . His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor . Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name , Caesar Augustus , which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title . The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome , an upholder of moral justice , and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire .",

  "To calculate what astronomical features a structure faced a coordinate system is needed . The stars provide such a system . If you were to go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole . This point is + 90 ° if you are watching the North Celestial Pole or − 90 ° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole . The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude , known as declination . The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West ( if the horizon is flat ) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0 ° . The visible declinations vary depending where you are on the globe . Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night ( see diagram below ) . Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction .",

  "The greatest tragedy during Tropical Storm Thelma took place in the city of Ormoc after torrential rains overwhelmed the Anilao – Malbasag watershed , sending flood waters rushing down the deforested mountainside .

The watershed , covering an area of 4 @,@ 567 hectares ( 11 @,@ 285 acres ) , is only 3 @.@ 3 percent forested , with the remainder being used for agricultural and private purposes . According to a study in 1990 , roughly 90 percent of the watershed had been converted into coconut and sugarcane plantations . The majority of this land was improperly cultivated since the 1970s , making conditions worse than they normally would have been . The natural structure of the mountains further contributed to the floods , with slopes as steep as 60 percent grade in some areas . In heavy rain events , this feature leaves the upper two @-@ thirds of the mountain range unstable . In the two hours prior to the heaviest rains , the soil in the watershed became saturated , greatly lessening its effectiveness at absorbing further rains . As a result , the tremendous rains that occurred just prior to the flood , during which rainfall rates reached 167 mm ( 6 @.@ 6 in ) per hour , the land was unable to absorb a majority of the rain .

  "In opposition to the formal theories of the generative school , functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool , its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions . Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate to each other as systems of formal rules or operations , while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out . The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language in terms of the concepts ( which are sometimes universal , and sometimes specific to a particular language ) which underlie its forms .

Some scholars attribute this to the strong Feudal society there , but an equally probable explanation is the historic influence of the Roman horse breeding traditions preserved by the Merovingians , combined with the addition of valuable Spanish and oriental bloodstock captured in the wake of the victory of Charles Martel over the Islamic Umayyad invaders at the Battle of Tours in 732 . Following this battle , the Carolingians began to increase their heavy cavalry , which resulted in the seizure of land ( for fodder production ) , and a change in tribute payment from cattle to horses .",

  "Observing the French fleet 's departure from the harbour at dusk , Pellew immediately dispatched Phoebe to Colpoys and Amazon to the main fleet at Portsmouth with warnings , before approaching the entrance to Brest in Indefatigable with the intention of disrupting French movements . Believing that the frigates in the bay must be the forerunners of a larger British force , de Galles attempted to pass his fleet through the Raz de Sein . This channel was a narrow , rocky and dangerous passage , and de Galles used corvettes as temporary light ships that shone blue lights and fired fireworks to direct his main fleet through the passage . Pellew observed this , and sailed Indefatigable right through the French fleet , launching rockets and shining lights seemingly at random . This succeeded in confusing the French officers , causing the Séduisant to strike the Grand Stevenent rock and sink with the loss of over 680 men from a complement of 1 @,@ 300 . Séduisant 's distress flares added to the confusion and delayed the fleet 's passage until dawn .

In July 1893 , the touring Australians played Somerset at Taunton for the first time since 1882 , when both the ground and the county team were barely established .

Hewett , along with Woods and Vernon Hill , arranged to play golf in Minehead . The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision , and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to take another look at the ground . Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences , claiming that \" the decision not to play was premature . \" At 14 : 00 , after their second inspection , the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start . Hewett reacted angrily , and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee . The Australian players were recalled from their picnic , and play began at 16 : 00 , although neither team particularly wanted to play . Roebuck recorded that \" Hewett , in particular , was in high dudgeon and ... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs , having been dropped once . \" David Foot offered a more tempered opinion , saying simply that Hewett 's \" mind wasn 't on the game . \" No play was possible on the second day , and on the third , Australia won the match by six wickets . Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee , who he felt had undermined his authority , prompting him to say that \" if a captain can 't lead at Taunton , this is no place for him . \" Although friends thought he was overreacting , he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season .

The ship , the barquentine Regina Maris ( schooner ) with 58 people aboard was impacted by high winds and rough seas , resulting in damage that led to the ship taking on 2000 gallons of water an hour . A Hurricane Hunter aircraft en route to the hurricane found the ship after receiving news that it was in the area and helped guide a rescue aircraft to the vessel before resuming its reconnaissance flight . The Vishva Tirth an Indian freighter , was the first vessel to arrive and it towed the Regina Maris to Los Angeles which took about 10 days .

  "With this theme of a loss of pleasure and inevitable death , the poem , according to Claude Finney , describes \" the inadequacy of the romantic escape from the world of reality to the world of ideal beauty \" . Earl Wasserman essentially agrees with Finney , but he extended his summation of the poem to incorporate the themes of Keats 's Mansion of Many Apartments when he says , \" the core of the poem is the search for the mystery , the unsuccessful quest for light within its darkness \" and this \" leads only to an increasing darkness , or a growing recognition of how impenetrable the mystery is to mortals . \" With these views in mind , the poem recalls Keats 's earlier view of pleasure and an optimistic view of poetry found within his earlier poems , especially Sleep and Poetry , and rejects them . This loss of pleasure and incorporation of death imagery lends the poem a dark air , which connects \" Ode to a Nightingale \" with Keats ' other poems that discuss the demonic nature of poetic imagination , including Lamia . In the poem , Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead — he uses an abrupt , almost brutal word for it — as a \" sod \" over which the nightingale sings .

  "In 1612 , having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter 's satellites , Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits , one could use their positions as a universal clock , and this would make possible the determination of longitude . He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life ; but the practical problems were severe . The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys ; this method , for example , was used to survey France , and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806 . For sea navigation , where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult , the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer , such as that of John Harrison .

  "This period saw the establishment of Qualified Chapels , where worship was conducted according to the English Book of Common Prayer and where congregations , led by priests ordained by Bishops of the Church of England or the Church of Ireland , were willing to pray for the Hanoverians . Such chapels drew their congregations from English people living in Scotland and from Scottish Episcopalians who were not bound to the Jacobite cause . These two forms of episcopalianism existed side by side until 1788 when the Jacobite claimant Charles Edward Stuart died in exile . Unwilling to recognise his brother Henry Benedict Stuart , who was a cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church , as his heir , the non @-@ juror Episcopalians elected to recognise the House of Hanover and offer allegiance to George III .

  "On January 18 , 1909 , Brenner submitted models to the Mint with a Lincoln profile on the obverse , and a reverse design very similar to that on the then @-@ current French silver coins , showing a tree branch . He also proposed designs for a Lincoln half dollar , with the late president to appear on one side , and a standing Liberty design — almost identical to the obverse of the same French coins . Leach replied on February 2 that no change to the half dollar could be made without congressional approval . By February 9 , Leach had discovered the origin of the branch design — although numismatic historian Don Taxay notes that it is odd Leach had not discovered the source of the standing Liberty design , given that they were on opposite sides of the same French coins . Leach did not confront the sculptor with the artistic borrowing , but instead simply ruled out the submitted designs as unsuitable for the reverse of the cent . He urged the sculptor to prepare a simple design , bearing the denomination , the country 's name , and the motto \" E pluribus unum \" . Brenner worked quickly , and on February 17 , delivered models for both obverse and reverse similar to the eventual coin , though with a somewhat larger bust of Lincoln , and the motto \" In God We Trust \" omitted . As a design element on the reverse , Brenner used two ears of durum wheat . The designs were shown to President Roosevelt , who approved them although Roosevelt required \" UNITED \" , which Brenner had spelled \" VNITED \" , to be spelled in the conventional way . After Leach examined the models , he objected to the fact that Brenner had put his full surname on the obverse . Brenner wrote in return , \" I shall take it out and put it in small letters on the reverse . \"",

  "In December 1915 , the Indian members founded the Provisional Government of India , which it was hoped would weigh on Habibullah 's advisory council to aid India and force the Emir 's hands . In January 1916 , the Emir approved a draft treaty with Germany to buy time . However , the Central campaign in the Middle East faltered at around this time , ending hopes that an overland route through Persia could be secured for aid and assistance to Afghanistan . The German members of the mission left Afghanistan in June 1916 , ending the German intrigues in the country . Nonetheless , Mahendra Pratap and his Provisional Government stayed behind , attempting to establish links with Japan , Republican China and Tsarist Russia . After the Russian revolution , Pratap opened negotiations with the Soviet Union , visiting Trotsky in Red Petrograd in 1918 , and Lenin in Moscow in 1919 and he visited the Kaiser in Berlin in 1918 . He pressed for a joint Soviet @-@ German offensive through Afghanistan into India . This was considered by the Soviets for some time after the 1919 coup in Afghanistan in which Amanullah Khan was instated as the Emir and the third Anglo @-@ Afghan war began .

  "A number of purported explanations have been advanced for Sargent 's nickname , \" Flash Harry \" . Reid opines that it \" was first in circulation among orchestral players before the war and that they used it in no spirit of adulation . \" It may have arisen from his impeccable and stylish appearance – he always wore a red or white carnation in his buttonhole ( the carnation is now the symbol of the school named for him ) . This was perhaps reinforced by his brisk tempi early in his career , and by a story about his racing from one recording session to another . Another explanation , that he was named after cartoonist Ronald Searle 's St Trinian 's character \" Flash Harry \" , is certainly wrong : Sargent 's nickname was current long before the first appearance of the St Trinian 's character in 1954 .

The dollar was attacked by congressmen from the Whig Party , then in the minority , on the grounds that it would be too small , would be counterfeited and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a half dime , the coins being similar in size .

  "Every second , approximately 28 cubed meters of water flows into the bay . The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass . As a result of the seawater exchange , the bay 's salinity is 15 parts per thousand , compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt . This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions , from Copano Creek , Mission River and Aransas River , forming the Mission @-@ Aransas estuary . Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay .

The army had traditionally been composed entirely of Arabs and Persians but Mathews opened up recruitment to the African majority on the island and had 300 recruits in training by the end of the year . In addition , Mathews employed some unorthodox recruitment methods such as purchasing slaves from their masters , using inmates from the prison and recruiting from Africans rescued from the slavers . In June 1877 , at the instigation of John Kirk , the explorer and friend of the Sultan , the British government sent a shipment of 500 modern rifles and ammunition as a gift with which to arm the troops . Mathews introduced a new uniform for the troops consisting of a red cap , short black jackets and white trousers for the enlisted ranks and dark blue frock coats and trousers with gold and silver lace for the Arab officers .

  "The Rother rises in the High Weald of Sussex , at around 490 feet ( 150 m ) above ordnance datum ( AOD ) , and descends rapidly . It is joined by the River Dudwell at Etchingham and the River Darwell at Robertsbridge , and by the time it reaches Udiam , it is only 7 feet ( 2 m ) AOD . Average annual rainfall in the High Weald is 35 inches ( 900 mm ) , and most of the underlying geology is impermeable , resulting in rain rapidly reaching the river and flowing down to the sea . The river valley is thus prone to winter floods , while during the summer months , the flow can be quite low in dry periods , as there are few groundwater aquifers . Between Udiam and Bodiam , the bed of the river drops below sea level , and the lower river flows slowly . The surrounding land is crossed by networks of canals and ditches , which are pumped into the river during the winter to drain the land . During the summer , water is transferred in the other direction , to manage the habitat of the marshland .",

As losses continued to mount for the production company , Khan was forced to close srkworld.com , a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited . In December 2001 , Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsi 's Shakti : The Power . He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc , and attempted multiple alternative therapies . None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury , which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films . By the beginning of 2003 , his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital , London . Khan resumed shooting in June 2003 , but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually .",

  "The Hongwu emperor from 1373 to 1384 staffed his bureaus with officials gathered through recommendations only . After that the scholar @-@ officials who populated the many ranks of bureaucracy were recruited through a rigorous examination system that was initially established by the Sui dynasty ( 581 – 618 ) . Theoretically the system of exams allowed anyone to join the ranks of imperial officials ( although it was frowned upon for merchants to join ) ; in reality the time and funding needed to support the study in preparation for the exam generally limited participants to those already coming from the landholding class . However , the government did exact provincial quotas while drafting officials . This was an effort to curb monopolization of power by landholding gentry who came from the most prosperous regions , where education was the most advanced . The expansion of the printing industry since Song times enhanced the spread of knowledge and number of potential exam candidates throughout the provinces . For young schoolchildren there were printed multiplication tables and primers for elementary vocabulary ; for adult examination candidates there were mass @-@ produced , inexpensive volumes of Confucian classics and successful examination answers .",

Fire Luigi , originally identical to Fire Mario , took on normal Luigi ’ s original colors to fit with his Fire colors in later games .",

  "Thereafter , Harald is reported in the sagas to have gone to Jerusalem and fought in battles in the area . Although the sagas place this after his expedition to Sicily , historian Kelly DeVries has questioned that chronology . Whether his trip was of a military or peaceful nature would depend on whether it took place before or after the 1036 peace treaty between Michael IV and the Fatimid Caliph Ma 'ad al @-@ Mustansir Billah ( in reality the Caliph 's mother , originally a Byzantine Christian , since the Caliph was a minor ) , although it is considered unlikely to have been made before . Modern historians have speculated that Harald may have been in a party sent to escort pilgrims to Jerusalem ( possibly including members of the Imperial family ) following the peace agreement , as it was also agreed that the Byzantines were allowed to repair the Church of the Holy Sepulchre . Furthermore , this may in turn have presented Harald with opportunities to fight against bandits who preyed on Christian pilgrims .",
  "In December 1943 , Eisenhower was appointed Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord , the invasion of Normandy . Eisenhower wished to take Smith and other key members of his AFHQ staff with him to his new assignment , but Prime Minister Winston Churchill wanted to retain Smith at AFHQ as Deputy Supreme Commander in the Mediterranean . Churchill reluctantly gave way at Eisenhower 's insistence . On New Year 's Eve , Smith met with General ( one day later Field Marshal ) Sir Alan Brooke to discuss the transfer of key British staff members from AFHQ to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) . Brooke released Gale only after a strong appeal from Smith , but refused to transfer Strong . A heated exchange resulted , and Brooke later complained to Eisenhower about Smith 's behavior .

  "The two main types of loans issued by the South during the war were \" Cotton Bonds \" , denominated in pounds sterling and sold in London , and high risk unbacked loans sold in the Netherlands . The Cotton Bonds were also convertible directly into bales of cotton , with a caveat , included as a means of political pressure on European countries to recognize the Confederacy , that any such shipments needed to be picked up by the bondholder in one of the blockaded Southern ports ( mostly New Orleans ) . Cotton Bonds initially were very popular and in high demand among the British ; William Ewart Gladstone , who at the time was the Chancellor of the Exchequer , was supposedly one of the buyers . The Confederate government managed to honor the Cotton Bonds throughout the war , and in fact their price rose steeply until the fall of Atlanta to Sherman , reflecting the increase in the underlying cotton prices and perhaps the possibility that George B. McClellan might get elected as US President on a peace platform . In contrast , the price of the Dutch @-@ issued high risk loans fell throughout the war , and the South selectively defaulted on servicing these obligations .",

  "Nielsen wrote three concertos : the Violin Concerto , Op. 33 is a middle @-@ period work , from 1911 , which lies within the tradition of European classicism , whereas the Flute Concerto ( without opus number ) of 1926 and the Clarinet Concerto , Op. 57 which followed in 1928 are late works , influenced by the modernism of the 1920s and , according to the Danish musicologist Herbert Rosenberg , the product of \" an extremely experienced composer who knows how to avoid inessentials . \" Unlike Nielsen 's later works , the Violin Concerto has a distinct , melody @-@ oriented neo @-@ classical structure . The Flute Concerto , in two movements , was written for the flautist Holger Gilbert @-@ Jespersen , a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet which had premiered Nielsen 's Wind Quintet ( 1922 ) . In contrast to the rather traditional style of the Violin Concerto , it reflects the modernistic trends of the period . The first movement , for example , switches between D minor , E @-@ flat minor and F major before the flute comes to the fore with a cantabile theme in E major . The Clarinet Concerto was also written for a member of the Copenhagen Wind Quintet , Aage Oxenvad . Nielsen stretches the capacities of instrument and player to the utmost ; the concerto has just one continuous movement and contains a struggle between the soloist and the orchestra and between the two principal competing keys , F major and E major .",

  "As the land dried , the peaty soils shrank , causing the land surface to drop . Much of the Middle Levels was flooded in 1841 @-@ 2 , and this led the Commissioners to obtain an Act of Parliament in 1844 , which authorised the construction of a new main drain , 11 miles ( 18 km ) long , in order that water could flow by gravity to Wiggenhall St Germans , where the levels of the tidal river were about 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) lower than at Salters Lode . The work was completed in 1848 , and the sluice at Marmount Priory was also built at this time , in order to allow boats with a deeper draught to navigate through Upwell and Outwell . A railway line from Ely to Peterborough passed through the port of March from 1846 , which soon became a railway hub , with branch lines to Wisbech and St Ives . Traffic transferred from the waterways , which made the drainage responsibilities of the Commissioners easier . The new main drain enabled Whittlesey Mere to be drained . A pumping station with an Appold centrifugal pump was used to achieve this , rather than the more traditional scoop wheel . The pump had been shown for the first time at the Great Exhibition in 1851 , where it amazed visitors , and its inventor was commissioned to design a pump for the draining of the mere . It was 4 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 4 m ) in diameter , and powered by a 25 hp ( 19 kW ) steam engine , could raise 101 tons of water per minute by 2 or 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 or 0 @.@ 9 m ) . In 1862 an Act of Parliament created the Middle Level Commissioners as a separate body to the Bedford Level Corporation , although they had been almost independent since 1810 , and they embarked on a series of improvements . Drainage was always the primary function , but navigation was also important , and the new body had powers to charge tolls for the use of the waterways .",

  "Vinson , who observed live hoopoe starlings when he lived on Réunion , described the crest as flexible , disunited and forward @-@ curled barbs of various lengths , highest in the centre , and able to be erected at will . He compared the bird 's crest to that of a cockatoo and to the tail feathers of a bird @-@ of @-@ paradise . Most mounted specimens have an erect crest , indicating its natural position . The only illustration of the hoopoe starling now thought to have been made from life was drawn by Paul Philippe Sauguin de Jossigny during the early 1770s . Jossigny instructed engravers under the drawing that for accuracy , they should depict the crest angled forward from the head ( not straight up ) . Hume believes that Martinet did this when he made the type illustration , and it was derivative of Jossigny 's image rather than a life drawing . Jossigny also made the only known life drawing of the now @-@ extinct Newton 's parakeet ( Psittacula exsul ) after a specimen sent to him from Rodrigues to Mauritius , so this is perhaps also where he drew the hoopoe starling . Murie suggested that only the illustrations by Martinet and Jacques Barraband were \" original \" , since he was unaware of Jossigny 's drawing , but noted a crudeness and stiffness in them which made neither appear lifelike .",

  "To hunt fish , the eagle swoops down over the water and snatches the fish out of the water with its talons . They eat by holding the fish in one claw and tearing the flesh with the other . Eagles have structures on their toes called spicules that allow them to grasp fish . Osprey also have this adaptation . Bald eagles have powerful talons and have been recorded flying with a 6 @.@ 8 kg ( 15 lb ) mule deer ( Odocoileus hemionus ) fawn . This feat is the record for the heaviest load carrying ever verified for a flying bird . It has been estimated that the gripping power ( pounds by square inch ) of the bald eagle is ten times greater than that of a human . Bald eagles can fly with fish at least equal to their own weight , but if the fish is too heavy to lift , the eagle may be dragged into the water . It may swim to safety , in some cases pulling the catch along to the shore as it swims , but some eagles drown or succumb to hypothermia . Many sources claim that bald eagles , like all large eagles , cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions . On numerous occasions , when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked , eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored , low flight over the water to a bank , where they then finish off and dismember the prey . When food is abundant , an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to 1 kg ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop . Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable . Occasionally , bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey , especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons , with one bird distracting potential prey , while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it . While hunting waterfowl , bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly , hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught ( white @-@ tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way ) . When hunting concentrated prey , a successful catch which often results in the hunting eagle being pursued by other eagles and needing to find an isolated perch for consumption if it is able to carry it away successfully .",

  "Following guidelines established by the IAU that classical Kuiper belt objects be given names of mythological beings associated with creation , in September 2006 the Caltech team submitted formal names from Hawaiian mythology to the IAU for both ( 136108 ) 2003 EL61 and its moons , in order \" to pay homage to the place where the satellites were discovered \" . The names were proposed by David Rabinowitz of the Caltech team . Haumea is the matron goddess of the island of Hawaiʻi , where the Mauna Kea Observatory is located . In addition , she is identified with Papa , the goddess of the earth and wife of Wākea ( space ) , which is appropriate because Haumea is thought to be composed almost entirely of solid rock , without the thick ice mantle over a small rocky core typical of other known Kuiper belt objects . Lastly , Haumea is the goddess of fertility and childbirth , with many children who sprang from different parts of her body ; this corresponds to the swarm of icy bodies thought to have broken off the dwarf planet during an ancient collision . The two known moons , also believed to have formed in this manner , are thus named after two of Haumea 's daughters , Hiʻiaka and Nāmaka .",

  "The wet , or rainy , season is the time of year , covering one or more months , when most of the average annual rainfall in a region falls .

The Cronica is also an incredibly rich historical record ; its greatest value to modern historians is its descriptions of the people , data , and events experienced by Villani during his lifetime . Historian Mark Phillips states that all subsequent Florentine accounts of the tyrannical regime of Walter VI of Brienne — including those by Leonardo Bruni and Niccolò Machiavelli — were based upon the primary source of Villani 's Cronica . Villani 's written work on Dante Alighieri and the age in which he lived has provided insight into Dante 's work , reasoning , and psyche .

  "While most of the university community is against the actions of the radical movements , this has not prevented the stigmatization of the student body by the general population . This attitude has led to the belief that the guerrilla and subversive groups that operate in Colombia have clandestine operatives inside the university , a belief that has been supported by the discovery of unconventional weaponry inside the university grounds . This has resulted in the targeting of student activists by criminal and paramilitary groups .

In his honor , the Government of Valle del Cauca and the Institute for the Development of Valle del Cauca ( Spanish : Instituto Financiero para el Desarrollo del Valle del Cauca , INFIVALLE ) established a scholarship program that bears his name .

  "The Western Gangas used Kannada and Sanskrit extensively as their language of administration . Some of their inscriptions are also bilingual in these languages . In bilingual inscriptions the formulaic passages stating origin myths , genealogies , titles of Kings and benedictions tended to be in Sanskrit , while the actual terms of the grant such as information on the land or village granted , its boundaries , participation of local authorities , rights and obligations of the grantee , taxes and dues and other local concerns were in the local language . The usage of these two languages showed important changes over the centuries . During the first phase ( 350 – 725 ) , Sanskrit copper plates dominated , indicating the initial ascendancy of the local language as a language of administration and the fact that majority of the records from this phase were brahmadeya grants ( grants to Brahmin temples ) . In the second phase ( 725 – 1000 ) , lithic inscriptions in Kannada outnumbered Sanskrit copper plates , consistent with the patronage Kannada received from rich and literate Jains who used Kannada as their medium to spread the Jain faith . Recent excavations at Tumbula near Mysore have revealed a set of early copper plate bilingual inscriptions dated 444 . The genealogy of the kings of the dynasty is described in Sanskrit while Kannada was used to describe the boundary of the village . An interesting inscription discovered at Beguru near modern Bangalore that deserves mention is the epigraph dated 890 that refers to a Bengaluru war . This is in Hale Kannada ( old Kannada ) language and is the earliest mention of the name of Bangalore city .

Within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored , non @-@ frontal synoptic cyclone , that develops over tropical or subtropical waters , with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre . The region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non @-@ frontal low pressure system , that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones .

Should the system intensify further or already have one @-@ minute sustained winds of 34 – 63 kn ( 39 – 73 mph ; 63 – 118 km / h ) , then it will be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name . Should the tropical system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured , as greater than 64 kn ( 74 mph ; 119 km / h ) , then it will be called a hurricane and classified on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale . The lowest classification on the SSHWS is a Category 1 hurricane , which has winds of between 64 – 82 kn ( 74 – 95 mph , 119 – 153 km / h ) .

When a system becomes a Category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96 – 112 kn ( 111 – 129 mph , 178 – 208 km / h ) , it is considered to be a major hurricane by the warning centers . A Category 4 hurricane has winds of 113 – 136 kn ( 130 – 156 mph , 209 – 251 km / h ) , while a Category 5 hurricane has winds of above 137 kn ( 157 mph , 252 km / h ) .",

The molecular genetic defects in renal tumors of people with BHD are different from two other similar kidney tumors , chromophobe renal cell carcinoma and renal oncocytoma . BHD @-@ associated tumorigenesis differs between the kidney , where loss of FLCN heterozygosity is responsible for cancers , and the skin , where FLCN is strongly expressed in heterozygotes . FLCN has been found to be overexpressed in fibrofolliculoma tissue and to have very low levels of expression in affected kidneys . Furthermore , the mTOR pathway is shown to be activated in tumor tissue from both humans and mice .",

  "One unresolved issue with this model is that it cannot explain how the initial orbits of the proto @-@ terrestrial planets , which would have needed to be highly eccentric to collide , produced the remarkably stable and nearly circular orbits they have today .

However , such gas , if it existed , would have prevented the terrestrial planets ' orbits from becoming so eccentric in the first place . Another hypothesis is that gravitational drag occurred not between the planets and residual gas but between the planets and the remaining small bodies . As the large bodies moved through the crowd of smaller objects , the smaller objects , attracted by the larger planets ' gravity , formed a region of higher density , a \" gravitational wake \" , in the larger objects ' path . As they did so , the increased gravity of the wake slowed the larger objects down into more regular orbits .",

  "Emperor Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I of 850 CE recognised that the Sanskrit style of Kannada literature was Margi ( formal or written form of language ) and Desi ( folk or spoken form of language ) style was popular and made his people aware of the strength and beauty of their native language Kannada . In 1112 CE , Jain poet Nayasena of Mulugunda , Dharwad district , in his Champu work Dharmamrita , a book on morals , warns writers from mixing Kannada with Sanskrit by comparing it with mixing of clarified butter and oil . He has written it using very limited Sanskrit words which fit with idiomatic Kannada .

Andayya may be considered as a protector of Kannada poets who were ridiculed by Sanskrit advocates . Thus Kannada is the only Dravidian language which is not only capable of using only native Kannada words and grammar in its literature ( like Tamil ) , but also use Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary ( like Telugu , Malayalam , Tulu , etc . ) The Champu style of literature of mixing poetry with prose owes its origins to the Kannada language which was later incorporated by poets into Sanskrit and other Indian languages .",

  "Evolution also does not require that organisms become more complex . Although the history of life shows an apparent trend towards the evolution of biological complexity ; there is a question if this appearance of increased complexity is real , or if this conclusion comes from neglecting the fact that the majority of life on Earth has always consisted of prokaryotes . In this view , complexity is not a necessary consequence of evolution ; rather , it is a consequence of the specific circumstances of evolution on Earth , which frequently made greater complexity advantageous , and thus naturally selected for . Depending on the situation , organisms ' complexity can either increase , decrease , or stay the same , and all three of these trends have been observed in evolution .",

  "Amazing Stories Quarterly was a U.S. science fiction pulp magazine published from 1928 to 1934 . It was launched by Hugo Gernsback as a companion to his Amazing Stories , the first science fiction magazine , which had begun publishing in April 1926 . Amazing Stories had been successful enough for Gernsback to try a single issue of Amazing Stories Annual in 1927 , which had sold well , and he decided to follow it up with a quarterly magazine . The first issue of Amazing Stories Quarterly was dated Winter 1928 and carried a reprint of H.G. Wells ' When the Sleeper Wakes . Gernsback 's policy of running a novel in each issue was popular with his readership , though the choice of Wells ' novel was less so . Over the next five issues only one more reprint appeared : Gernsback 's own novel Ralph 124C 41 + , in the Winter 1929 issue . Gernsback went bankrupt in early 1929 , and lost control of both Amazing Stories and Amazing Stories Quarterly ; his assistant , T. O 'Conor Sloane , took over as editor . The magazine began to run into financial difficulties in 1932 , and the schedule became irregular ; the last issue was dated Fall 1934 .",
