  "The large @-@ scale inflammation that occurs in the subarachnoid space during meningitis is not a direct result of bacterial infection but can rather largely be attributed to the response of the immune system to the entry of bacteria into the central nervous system . When components of the bacterial cell membrane are identified by the immune cells of the brain ( astrocytes and microglia ) , they respond by releasing large amounts of cytokines , hormone @-@ like mediators that recruit other immune cells and stimulate other tissues to participate in an immune response . The blood – brain barrier becomes more permeable , leading to \" vasogenic \" cerebral edema ( swelling of the brain due to fluid leakage from blood vessels ) . Large numbers of white blood cells enter the CSF , causing inflammation of the meninges and leading to \" interstitial \" edema ( swelling due to fluid between the cells ) . In addition , the walls of the blood vessels themselves become inflamed ( cerebral vasculitis ) , which leads to decreased blood flow and a third type of edema , \" cytotoxic \" edema . The three forms of cerebral edema all lead to increased intracranial pressure ; together with the lowered blood pressure often encountered in acute infection , this means that it is harder for blood to enter the brain , consequently brain cells are deprived of oxygen and undergo apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) .",

  "B. cuneata is very unusual in apparently suffering no seed loss due to granivory . In nearly all other species , burrowing insect larvae eat a large proportion of seeds , and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat . The seed @-@ eating insects are mostly species @-@ specific , and it appears that no insect species has adapted to B. cuneata . Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts , and the rarity of the species , both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species . There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen . As a result , this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a Banksia species : in one study , 74 % of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable . This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old , about 90 % of which is viable . After the ninth year , viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and senescence sets in . Seed production itself starts very slowly . On average , plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy . Storage increases exponentially , however , and 25 @-@ year @-@ old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds . Seed production probably never plateaus . In fact , by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away ; and by the age of thirty , plants have broken branches more often than not . As plants age , branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death , and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years .",

  "Sociologists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques . These disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory . While very different in many aspects , both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between theory and data . Quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology , especially in the United States . In the discipline 's two most cited journals , quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones by a factor of two . ( Most articles published in the largest British journal , on the other hand , are qualitative . ) Most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective , and the very term \" methodology \" is often used synonymously with \" statistics . \" Practically all sociology PhD programs in the United States require training in statistical methods . The work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more ' trustworthy ' and ' unbiased ' by the greater public , though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists .",

  "Classifiers did not gain official recognition as a lexical category ( part of speech ) until the 20th century . The earliest modern text to discuss classifiers and their use was Ma Jianzhong 's 1898 Ma 's Basic Principles for Writing Clearly ( 马氏文通 ) . From then until the 1940s , linguists such as Ma , Wang Li , and Li Jinxi treated classifiers as just a type of noun that \" expresses a quantity \" .

He made this separation based on the fact that classifiers were semantically bleached , and that they can be used directly with a number , whereas true nouns need to have a measure word added before they can be used with a number . After this time , other names were also proposed for classifiers : Gao Mingkai called them \" noun helper words \" ( 助名词 zhùmíngcí ) , Lu Wangdao \" counting markers \" ( 计标 jìbiāo ) , and Japanese linguist Miyawaki Kennosuke called them \" accompanying words \" ( 陪伴词 péibàncí ) .

  "Cubs are born with soft , brownish black hair , and weigh 1 @.@ 5 kg on average . Unique among carnivorous mammals , spotted hyenas are also born with their eyes open and with 6 – 7 mm long canine teeth and 4 mm long incisors . Also , cubs will attack each other shortly after birth . This is particularly apparent in same sexed litters , and can result in the death of the weaker cub . This neonatal siblicide kills an estimated 25 % of all hyenas in their first month . Male cubs which survive grow faster and are likelier to achieve reproductive dominance , while female survivors eliminate rivals for dominance in their natal clan . Lactating females can carry 3 – 4 kg ( 6 @.@ 6 – 8 @.@ 8 lb ) of milk in their udders . Spotted hyena milk has the highest protein content of any terrestrial carnivore , and its fat content is second only to that of the polar bear and sea otter . Cubs will nurse from their mother for 12 – 16 months , though they can process solid food as early as three months . Mothers do not regurgitate food for their young . Females are very protective of their cubs , and will not tolerate other adults , particularly males , approaching them . Spotted hyenas exhibit adult behaviours very early in life ; cubs have been observed to ritually sniff each other and mark their living space before the age of one month . Within ten days of birth , they are able to move at considerable speed . Cubs begin to lose the black coat and develop the spotted , lighter coloured pelage of the adults at 2 – 3 months . They begin to exhibit hunting behaviours at the age of eight months , and will begin fully participating in group hunts after their first year . Spotted hyenas reach sexual maturity at the age of three years . The average lifespan in zoos is 12 years , with a maximum of 25 years .",

  "Transgressive films as a distinct artistic movement began in the 1970s . Unconcerned with genre distinctions , they drew inspiration equally from the nonconformity of European art cinema and experimental film , the gritty subject matter of Italian neorealism , and the shocking images of 1960s exploitation . Some used hardcore pornography and horror , occasionally at the same time . In the 1980s , filmmaker Nick Zedd identified this movement as the Cinema of Transgression and later wrote a manifesto . Popular in midnight showings , they were mainly limited to large urban areas , which led academic Joan Hawkins to label them as \" downtown culture \" . These films acquired a legendary reputation as they were discussed and debated in alternative weeklies , such as The Village Voice . Home video would finally allow general audiences to see them , which gave many people their first taste of underground film . Ernest Mathijs says that cult films often disrupt viewer expectations , such as giving characters transgressive motivations or focusing attention on elements outside the film . Cult films can also transgress national stereotypes and genre conventions , such as Battle Royale ( 2000 ) , which broke many rules of teenage slasher films . The reverse – when films based on cult properties lose their transgressive edge – can result in derision and rejection by fans . Audience participation itself can be transgressive , such as breaking long @-@ standing taboos against talking during films and throwing things at the screen .",

  "The most significant longfin mako catches are by Japanese tropical longline fisheries , and those sharks occasionally enter Tokyo markets . From 1987 to 1994 , United States fisheries reported catches ( discarded , as this species is worthless on the North American market ) of 2 – 12 tons per year . Since 1999 , retention of this species has been prohibited by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) Fishery Management Plan ( FMP ) for Atlantic sharks . Longfin makos were once significant in the Cuban longline fishery , comprising a sixth of the shark landings from 1971 to 1972 ; more recent data from this fishery is not available . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed this species as Vulnerable due to its uncommonness , low reproductive rate , and susceptibility to shark fishing gear . It has also been listed under Annex I of the Convention on Migratory Species ( CMS ) Migratory Shark Memorandum of Understanding . In the North Atlantic , stocks of the shortfin mako have declined 40 % or more since the late 1980s , and there are concerns that populations of the longfin mako are following the same trend .",

  "The first major change to the ship of the line concept was the introduction of steam power as an auxiliary propulsion system . Steam power was gradually introduced to the navy in the first half of the 19th century , initially for small craft and later for frigates . The French Navy introduced steam to the line of battle with the 90 @-@ gun Napoléon in 1850 — the first true steam battleship . Napoléon was armed as a conventional ship @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line , but her steam engines could give her a speed of 12 knots ( 22 km / h ) , regardless of the wind condition . This was a potentially decisive advantage in a naval engagement . The introduction of steam accelerated the growth in size of battleships . France and the United Kingdom were the only countries to develop fleets of wooden steam screw battleships , although several other navies operated small numbers of screw battleships , including Russia ( 9 ) , Turkey ( 3 ) , Sweden ( 2 ) , Naples ( 1 ) , Denmark ( 1 ) and Austria ( 1 ) .",

As with Geoffrey , the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled , but the situation was a stalemate : Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign , whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen . By this point , however , Stephen 's practice of inviting barons to court and arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust .",

  "By the early 1930s , both Europe and America were suffering from the Great Depression , which inhibited both new opera and ballet productions , though audiences for Prokofiev 's appearances as a pianist were — in Europe at least — undiminished . However Prokofiev , who saw himself as a composer first and foremost , increasingly resented the amount of time that was lost to composition through his appearances as a pianist . Having been homesick for some time , Prokofiev began to build substantial bridges with the Soviet Union . Following the dissolution of the RAPM in 1932 , he acted increasingly as a musical ambassador between his homeland and western Europe , and his premieres and commissions were increasingly under the auspices of the Soviet Union . One such was Lieutenant Kijé , which was commissioned as the score to a Soviet film . Another commission , from the Kirov Theatre ( as the Mariinsky had now been renamed ) in Leningrad , was the ballet Romeo and Juliet , composed to a scenario created by Adrian Piotrovsky and Sergei Radlov following the precepts of \" drambalet \" ( dramatised ballet , officially promoted at the Kirov to replace works based primarily on choreographic display and innovation ) . Following Radlov 's acrimonious resignation from the Kirov in June 1934 , a new agreement was signed with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the understanding that Piotrovsky would remain involved . However , the ballet 's original happy ending ( contrary to Shakespeare ) provoked controversy among Soviet cultural officials ; the ballet 's production was then postponed indefinitely when the staff of the Bolshoi was overhauled at the behest of the chairman of the Committee on Arts Affairs , Platon Kerzhentsev .

  "Sumner easily won reelection in 1798 and 1799 , but was ill during the 1799 race , which he won by a landslide . Constitutional issues were raised because he was on his deathbed and it was uncertain that he could even take the oath of office . Sumner finally took the oath of office in early June , but died a few days later , at which point Gill became acting governor . Gill served out Sumner 's term , and was considered a candidate for the governorship as the 1800 election approached . The election primarily pitted Federalist Caleb Strong against Democratic @-@ Republican Elbridge Gerry , and was won by Strong . Gill was derided by his opponents as the preferred candidate of the wealthy , and Federalists were accused of promoting him as a candidate in order to divide the opposition . Gill died on May 20 , before Strong was informed of the victory , resulting in the only time in the state 's history when the offices of governor and lieutenant governor were both formally vacant . As a result , the Governor 's Council ruled the state for ten days .

The altricial state is typical for squirrels and mice , while the precocial state usually occurs in species like guinea pigs and porcupines . Females with altricial young typically build elaborate nests before they give birth and maintain them until their offspring are weaned .

The newborns first venture out of the nest a few days after they have opened their eyes and initially keep returning regularly .

  "Because of their large size , elephants have a huge impact on their environments and are considered keystone species . Their habit of uprooting trees and undergrowth can transform savannah into grasslands ; when they dig for water during drought , they create waterholes that can be used by other animals . They can enlarge waterholes when they bathe and wallow in them . At Mount Elgon , elephants excavate caves that are used by ungulates , hyraxes , bats , birds and insects . Elephants are important seed dispersers ; African forest elephants ingest and defecate seeds , with either no effect or a positive effect on germination . The seeds are typically dispersed in large amounts over great distances . In Asian forests , large seeds require giant herbivores like elephants and rhinoceros for transport and dispersal . This ecological niche cannot be filled by the next largest herbivore , the tapir . Because most of the food elephants eat goes undigested , their dung can provide food for other animals , such as dung beetles and monkeys . Elephants can have a negative impact on ecosystems .

The illustration was based on a drawing in Lady Impey 's collection and Latham called it the gigantic crane and included observations by an African traveller named Smeathman who described a similar bird from western Africa . Johann Friedrich Gmelin used Latham 's description and described the Indian bird as Ardea dubia in 1789 while Latham later used the name Ardea argala for the Indian bird . Temminck used the name Ciconia marabou in 1824 based on the local name used in Senegal for the African bird and this was also applied to the Indian species . This led to considerable confusion between the African and Indian species .

  "Two main theories have emerged to explain the formation and evolution of the Jupiter trojans . The first suggests that the Jupiter trojans formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming . The last stage of Jupiter 's formation involved runaway growth of its mass through the accretion of large amounts of hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk ; during this growth , which lasted for only about 10 @,@ 000 years , the mass of Jupiter increased by a factor of ten . The planetesimals that had approximately the same orbits as Jupiter were caught by the increased gravity of the planet . The capture mechanism was very efficient — about 50 % of all remaining planetesimals were trapped . This hypothesis has two major problems : the number of trapped bodies exceeds the observed population of Jupiter trojans by four orders of magnitude , and the present Jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by the capture model .

While Madara Uchiha is stated to be the first person to awaken the Mangekyō Sharingan , which resulted in a common tradition for members of the Uchiha clan to follow his example by killing their friends , an ability of the Mangekyō ( Susanoo ) had been used since the time of the first Sharingan user , Indra .

Once recording commenced , the band worked eight to ten hours a day .

The group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed .

The imperial reform proclaimed an \" eternal public peace \" ( Ewiger Landfriede ) to put an end to the abounding feuds and the anarchy of the robber barons and it defined a new standing Imperial Army to enforce that peace , to which each imperial estate ( Reichsstand ) would have had to send troops . It also mandated the common penny ( Reichspfennig ) , a new head tax to finance this army . Among the concessions Maximilian had to make was the institution of a new supreme court , the Reichskammergericht , thus separating the highest judicial authority from the person and the whereabouts of the emperor . He also had to agree to the formation of a governmental council of princes called the Reichsregiment . It would never play a significant role : it convened for the first time in 1500 , but was dissolved by Maximilian two years later .",

  "Blaine was appointed to the Senate on July 10 , 1876 , but did not begin his duties there until the Senate convened in December of that year . While in the Senate , he served on the Appropriations Committee and held the chairmanship of the Committee on Civil Service and Retrenchment , but he never achieved the role of leadership that he had held as a member of the House . The Senate in the 45th Congress was controlled by a narrow Republican majority , but it was a majority often divided against itself and against the Hayes administration . Blaine did not number himself among the administration 's defenders , but neither could he join the Republicans led by Conkling — later known as the Stalwarts — who opposed Hayes , because of the deep personal enmity between Blaine and Conkling . He opposed Hayes 's withdrawal of federal troops from Southern capitals , which effectively ended the Reconstruction of the South , but to no avail .

The Times wrote that she had \" started a revolution amongst women in music ...

  "Bart 's voice actor , Nancy Cartwright , wrote in her autobiography My Life as a 10 @-@ Year @-@ Old Boy that the episode 's script gives the audience a \" visual and aural feast \" . She said the background designers \" must have gone on another field trip for this one \" because they captured the look of a typical musical recording studio . The recording studio in the episode , where Lurleen records her new songs with the Simpson family , features two rooms , one for the artist and one for the engineer , with a pane of glass between them . Cartwright said the designers added their own \" special touch \" by putting a few cracks on the walls , designing a slightly dilapidated ceiling , and by making it look as if the soundproofing on the walls is falling off . The property designers went on a field trip to Sun Studio to receive inspiration for the props in the recording studio , such as the \" in session \" red light , the mixing board , the musical instruments , and the volume @-@ unit meters that indicates how loud the artist is singing . For the interior design of the recording studio , the color designers mixed colors such as orange , mauve , gray , and brown to make them complement each other . The colors in the engineer 's booth were darker to make Homer 's white suit stand out from the background . The appearance of the engineer at the recording studio was based on John Boylan , an American music producer who produced the highly successful album The Simpsons Sing the Blues . Lurleen 's mobile home was designed to be \" very confined \" and \" tiny \" so that the compositions of Homer and Lurleen would be tighter , thus giving the scene an intimate , romantic feeling .",

  "In 1933 , H.D. traveled to Vienna to undergo analysis with Sigmund Freud . She had an interest in Freud 's theories as far back as 1909 , when she read some of his works in the original German . H.D. was referred by Bryher 's psychoanalyst due to her apparent paranoia about the rise of Adolf Hitler which indicated another world war , an idea that H.D. found intolerable . The Great War ( World War I ) had left her feeling shattered . She had lost her brother in action , while her husband suffered effects of combat experiences , and she believed that the onslaught of the war indirectly caused the death of her child with Aldington : she believed it was her shock at hearing the news about the RMS Lusitania that directly caused her child to be stillborn . Writing on the Wall , her memoir about this psychoanalysis , was written concurrently with Trilogy and published in 1944 ; in 1956 it was republished with Advent , a journal of the analysis , under the title Tribute to Freud .",

Although selected for another Test trial , Macaulay did not play in the series against the touring South African team until the third Test at Leeds , where he took one wicket in each South African innings , but was omitted from the final two Tests . Despite his success in the season , he was not chosen to tour Australia with the MCC that winter , even though Maurice Tate , the leading bowler on the tour , lacked support . Macaulay had been involved in controversy on the field in 1924 . At the time , the Yorkshire team were notorious for their aggressive attitude while fielding . In a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield , the hostility of the crowd provoked an MCC inquiry which found that Yorkshire bowler Abe Waddington had incited the spectators . Further incidents followed against Surrey . The editor of Wisden blamed Yorkshire 's poor discipline on a small group of approximately four players . Without naming Macaulay as one of them , he noted that Lord Hawke , the Yorkshire president , believed Macaulay should have been in the team to Australia , and that \" it was entirely his own fault he was not chosen \" . It is also possible that during a match at this time , Macaulay openly criticised the captaincy and bowling of Arthur Gilligan , the England captain .",

  "Some inter @-@ war architects developed this approach further . Some traditional classical memorials had been criticised in both England and Germany as being fussy and overly ornate . Men such as Lutyens took the classical principles , but simplified them until the design became almost abstract . These memorials used abstract , beautiful designs intended to remove the viewer from the real world , and focus them on an idealised sense of self @-@ sacrifice , a continuation of the principle of a \" beautiful death \" . In many ways the simplified , but still classical , forms of memorials like the Cenotaph meant that mourners could read their own thoughts and concerns onto the memorial . Where dead soldiers were shown , they were depicted in an image of serenity and peace , often physically distanced from the viewer on a high platform , the entire effect reflected by the silence that traditionally surrounds ceremonies at the Cenotaph .",

This heralded a number of significant postwar European productions . Mary Wigman in Berlin ( 1957 ) followed Horton in highlighting the erotic aspects of virgin sacrifice , as did Maurice Béjart in Brussels ( 1959 ) . Béjart ' s representation replaced the culminating sacrifice with a depiction of what the critic Robert Johnson describes as \" ceremonial coitus \" .

It has remained in the company 's repertoire for more than 50 years ; after its revival in May 2011 the Daily Telegraph 's critic Mark Monahan called it one of the Royal Ballet 's greatest achievements . Moscow first saw The Rite in 1965 , in a version choreographed for the Bolshoi Ballet by Natalia Kasatkina and Vladimir Vasiliev .

  "Einar Haugen expanded the diaphonic approach to the study of bilingualism , believing diaphones represented the process of interlingual identification wherein sounds from different languages are perceptually linked into a single category . Because interlingual identifications may happen between unrelated varieties , it is possible to construct a diasystem for many different language contact situations , with the appropriateness of such a construction depending on its purpose and its simplicity depending on how isomorphic the phonology of the systems are . For example , the Spanish of Los Ojos ( a small village in Rio Arriba County , New Mexico ) and the local variety of Southwestern English are fairly isomorphic with each other so a diaphonic approach for such a language contact situation would be relatively straightforward . Nagara ( 1972 ) makes use of a diaphonic approach in discussing the phonology of the pidgin English used by Japanese immigrants on Hawaiian plantations .",

  "Von Neumann founded the field of continuous geometry based on lattice theoretic principles . Earlier , Menger and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex projective geometry in terms of the properties of its lattice of linear subspaces .

  "According to the Historia Brittonum , Penda besieged Oswiu at Iudeu ; this site has been identified with Stirling , in the north of Oswiu 's kingdom . Oswiu tried to buy peace : in the Historia Brittonum , it is said that Oswiu offered treasure , which Penda distributed among his British allies . Bede states that the offer was simply rejected by Penda , who \" resolved to extirpate all of [ Oswiu 's ] nation , from the highest to the lowest \" . Additionally , according to Bede , Oswiu 's son Ecgfrith was being held hostage \" at the court of Queen Cynwise , in the province of the Mercians \" — perhaps surrendered by Oswiu as part of some negotiations or arrangement . It would seem that Penda 's army then moved back south , perhaps returning home , but a great battle was fought near the river Winwaed in the region of Loidis , thought to be somewhere in the area around modern day Leeds , on a date given by Bede as 15 November . The identification of the Winwaed with a modern river is uncertain , but possibly it was a tributary of the Humber . There is good reason to believe it may well have been the river now known as Cock Beck in the ancient kingdom of Elmet . The Cock Beck meanders its way through Pendas Fields , close to an ancient well known as Pen Well on the outskirts of Leeds , before eventually joining the River Wharfe . This same Cock Beck whilst in flood also played a significant role in the much later Battle of Towton in 1461 . Another possibility is the River Went ( a tributary of the River Don , situated to the north of modern @-@ day Doncaster ) . It may be that Penda 's army was attacked by Oswiu at a point of strategic vulnerability , which would help explain Oswiu 's victory over forces that were , according to Bede , much larger than his own .",

Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester , all her subsequent children died , either in the womb or immediately after birth . The English parliament did not want the throne to revert to a Catholic , so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701 , which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James , Sophia , Electress of Hanover , and her Protestant heirs .

  "The 20 amino acids encoded directly by the genetic code can be divided into several groups based on their properties . Important factors are charge , hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity , size , and functional groups . These properties are important for protein structure and protein – protein interactions . The water @-@ soluble proteins tend to have their hydrophobic residues ( Leu , Ile , Val , Phe , and Trp ) buried in the middle of the protein , whereas hydrophilic side @-@ chains are exposed to the aqueous solvent . ( Note that in biochemistry , a residue refers to a specific monomer within the polymeric chain of a polysaccharide , protein or nucleic acid . ) The integral membrane proteins tend to have outer rings of exposed hydrophobic amino acids that anchor them into the lipid bilayer . In the case part @-@ way between these two extremes , some peripheral membrane proteins have a patch of hydrophobic amino acids on their surface that locks onto the membrane . In similar fashion , proteins that have to bind to positively charged molecules have surfaces rich with negatively charged amino acids like glutamate and aspartate , while proteins binding to negatively charged molecules have surfaces rich with positively charged chains like lysine and arginine . There are different hydrophobicity scales of amino acid residues .",

  "The armies of Elagabalus , led by Gannys , a novice but determined commander , met with the Praetorian Guard of Macrinus in a narrowly fought pitched battle . Prior to battle Macrinus had the Praetorian Guard set aside their scaled armour breastplates and grooved shields in favour of lighter oval shields , thus making them lighter and more manoeuvrable and also negating the advantage of light Parthian lancers ( lanciarii ) . Despite the numerical superiority of Gannys ' army of at least two full legions , faced with what levies Macrinus was able to accrue , the engagement had begun in Macrinus ' favour with the soldiers led by Gannys turning to flee after the Praetorian Guards had managed to break through the enemy line . At some point during the retreat , Julia Maesa and Soaemias Bassiana ( Elagabalus ' mother ) joined the fray , rallying the forces while Gannys , who was on horseback , charged headlong at the enemy thus ending the retreat and renewing the assault . At this point Macrinus , fearing defeat , fled back to the city of Antioch .

  "Once sentenced , malefactors were usually held in prison for a few days before being taken to the place of execution . During the early Middle Ages this journey may have been made tied directly to the back of a horse , but it subsequently became customary to be fastened instead to a wicker hurdle , or wooden panel , itself tied to the horse . Historian Frederic William Maitland thought that this was probably to \" [ secure ] for the hangman a yet living body \" . The use of the word drawn , as in \" to draw \" , has caused a degree of confusion . One of the Oxford English Dictionary 's definitions of draw is \" to draw out the viscera or intestines of ; to disembowel ( a fowl , etc. before cooking , a traitor or other criminal after hanging ) \" , but this is followed by \" in many cases of executions it is uncertain whether this , or sense 4 [ To drag ( a criminal ) at a horse 's tail , or on a hurdle or the like , to the place of execution ; formerly a legal punishment of high treason ] , is meant . The presumption is that where drawn is mentioned after hanged , the sense is as here . \" Historian Ram Sharan Sharma arrived at the same conclusion : \" Where , as in the popular hung , drawn and quartered [ use ] ( meaning facetiously , of a person , completely disposed of ) , drawn follows hanged or hung , it is to be referred to as the disembowelling of the traitor . \" The historian and author Ian Mortimer disagrees . In an essay published on his website , he writes that the separate mention of evisceration is a relatively modern device , and that while it certainly took place on many occasions , the presumption that drawing means to disembowel is spurious . Instead , drawing ( as a method of transportation ) may be mentioned after hanging because it was a supplementary part of the execution .",

  "The influence of Jacques @-@ Louis David can be seen in the painting 's scale , in the sculptural tautness of the figures and in the heightened manner in which a particularly significant \" fruitful moment \" — the first awareness of the approaching ship — is described . In 1793 , David also painted an important current event with The Death of Marat .

  "Cells are known to eliminate three types of damage to their DNA by chemically reversing it . These mechanisms do not require a template , since the types of damage they counteract can occur in only one of the four bases . Such direct reversal mechanisms are specific to the type of damage incurred and do not involve breakage of the phosphodiester backbone . The formation of pyrimidine dimers upon irradiation with UV light results in an abnormal covalent bond between adjacent pyrimidine bases . The photoreactivation process directly reverses this damage by the action of the enzyme photolyase , whose activation is obligately dependent on energy absorbed from blue / UV light ( 300 – 500 nm wavelength ) to promote catalysis . Photolyase , an old enzyme present in bacteria , fungi , and most animals no longer functions in humans , who instead use nucleotide excision repair to repair damage from UV irradiation . Another type of damage , methylation of guanine bases , is directly reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase ( MGMT ) , the bacterial equivalent of which is called ogt . This is an expensive process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once ; that is , the reaction is stoichiometric rather than catalytic . A generalized response to methylating agents in bacteria is known as the adaptive response and confers a level of resistance to alkylating agents upon sustained exposure by upregulation of alkylation repair enzymes . The third type of DNA damage reversed by cells is certain methylation of the bases cytosine and adenine .",

  "Artists Mike Marsicano and Kurt Bickenbach played critical roles in the creation of the game 's aircraft models , which were built in 3D Studio . As reference material , the team photographed real planes at several airfields , and they received blueprints and datasheets from aircraft manufacturers . The game 's Grob G103a Twin II sailplane was based directly on the one that Blackley owned at the time . The sophistication of the real @-@ time CFDs complicated the 3D modeling process , as the planes required accurate geometry to fly properly . While attempting to meet this goal , however , Bickenbach said that the models he created were overly detailed , which caused the team to struggle with performance issues related to the high number of polygons . Reducing the number altered the plane 's shape , which in turn reduced its flight realism ; this necessitated a balance between performance and accuracy . To obtain audio for the planes , Greg LoPiccolo and Tom Streit — former bassist and road manager , respectively , of the band Tribe — visited a Florida importer of Russian aerobatic aircraft . The two placed microphones inside the cockpits and next to the engines , and they flew each plane at multiple speeds while recording with a digital audio tape machine . Combining this material with digital recordings of wind sounds , the team fashioned a physics @-@ based sound system : sounds of the wind and engine are altered in real @-@ time based on wind speed in the game .",

Masato Kato confirmed that Cross featured a central theme of parallel worlds , as well as the fate of Schala , which he was previously unable to expound upon in Chrono Trigger . Concerning the ending sequences showing Kid searching for someone in a modern city , he hoped to make players realize that alternate futures and possibilities may exist in their own lives , and that this realization would \" not ... stop with the game \" .

He also added instances of wordplay and alliteration to compensate for difficult Japanese jokes . To streamline translation for all 45 playable characters , Honeywood created his own version of the accent generator which needed to be more robust than the simple verbal tics of the Japanese cast .

Jaffe 's idea was that \" God of War explains , or ultimately will explain , why there are no more Greek myths \" . He said that it would have been \" hell on earth \" as the gods and Titans battled each other for domination . Other mythological pantheons would have become involved after Kratos killed Zeus and the other Greek gods , and the result would be that humankind no longer believed in the gods — according to Jaffe , the only way a god can truly die . God of War III was first mentioned by God of War II game director Cory Barlog at a God of War II launch event .

It is a seclusive species , making it challenging to observe in its natural habitat .

Such behavior is indicative of the bog turtle 's ability to survive without oxygen . On warmer days , the bog turtle 's activities include scavenging , mating ( during early spring ) , and basking in sunlight , the last of which it spends a great deal of the day doing .

  "Far from hiding her griefs from her mother , the young girl asked nothing better than to have her as friend and comforter ; but she could not speak for shame , her modesty could find no words to describe a condition so unworthy of her , as the emotion which disturbed her senses in spite of all her efforts . At length her very shame gave her mother a clue to her difficulty , and she drew from her the humiliating confession . Far from distressing her with reproaches or unjust blame , she consoled her , pitied her , wept over her ; she was too wise to make a crime of an evil which virtue alone made so cruel . But why put up with such an evil when there was no necessity to do so , when the remedy was so easy and so legitimate ? Why did she not use the freedom they had granted her ? Why did she not take a husband ? Why did she not make her choice ? Did she not know that she was perfectly independent in this matter , that whatever her choice , it would be approved , for it was sure to be good ? They had sent her to town , but she would not stay ; many suitors had offered themselves , but she would have none of them . What did she expect ? What did she want ? What an inexplicable contradiction ?",

Carleton was somewhat lenient with minor offenders , and even freed a number of more serious offenders on the promise of good behavior ; however , once the Americans had been driven from the province , measures against supporters of the American cause became harsher , with forced labor to repair American destruction of infrastructure during the army 's retreat being a frequent punishment .

  "After hostilities broke out on the frontier between the Americans and the native tribes , culminating in the Battle of Tippecanoe in November 1811 , Jennings successfully promoted passage of a bill to grant compensation to veterans of the battle and to give pensions for five years to the widows and orphans of those who were killed . Privately , Jennings lamented the battle , while his friends in the territory faulted Harrison for agitating the situation and causing the needless loss of life . As calls for war with Great Britain increased , Jennings was not among the war hawks , but ultimately accepted the arrival of the War of 1812 . Early in the war , Harrison was commissioned as a military general and dispatched to defend the frontier and invade Canada , which caused him to resign from his post as territorial governor in 1812 . Prior to Harrison 's resignation , Jennings and his allies moved quickly to take advantage of the situation and initiated efforts to weaken the governor 's authority . In 1811 the territorial legislature voted to move the capital away from Vincennes , a pro @-@ Harrison stronghold , and began a shift in political power from the territorial governor to the delegates in the territorial legislature and its elected officials . John Gibson , the elderly , acting governor , whose territorial duties largely dealt with military affairs , did not challenge the territorial legislature . When Harrison 's successor , Thomas Posey , was confirmed on March 3 , 1813 , Jennings 's party in the territorial legislature had become entrenched and began to advance their request for statehood .",

  "During the story development process , the team decided upon a female protagonist as the game 's lead , in contrast to the previous games which had featured male protagonists , along with a large number of other female characters : this was primarily because all other proposals had been rejected or scrapped . Many aspects of Zero 's design and abilities were intended to evoke the game 's gritty atmosphere , while the flower growing from her eye was almost cut when Shiba thought it would be too much of a risk for the series when coupled with the character 's gender .

While writing Mikhail 's dialogue , Natori was asked by Yoko to embody the good qualities of animals and children in him . Instead of being realistic , Natori borrowed elements from other fiction to create his personality , finding him the most fun to write . The dialogue between Zero and her disciples was written by Yoko to contrast in content with the violent combat .

  "Mega Man series artist Keiji Inafune , credited as \" Inafking \" , stated that the development team had very few problems while working on Mega Man 4 . Inafune designed Dr. Cossack and Kalinka as two new storyline characters for the game . Cossack , who was originally named \" Dr. Vice \" , was made much younger than Dr. Light and Dr. Wily . Inafune also considered giving him American traits , but decided upon influences from Russia instead . Kalinka was created because so many male characters already existed in the series at this point . However , Inafune did not intend for players to compare her to Mega Man 's sister Roll . The idea for Eddie originally came about during the development of Mega Man 2 . Eddie was designed as a supporting character that \" would behave like a lottery \" , either pleasantly surprising or disappointing the player with the item he gives Mega Man .",
  "Likewise , Paul Krugman argued that the existence of a single shared currency across the entire eurozone , in combination with tight money policies of the ECB ( motivated by insistence of Germany on low inflation ) , placed much of the Southern Europe in a state of permanent high unemployment . According to Krugman , during the period between the creation of the euro and the 2008 financial crisis , countries of Southern Europe experienced abnormally high rates of wage growth due to high influx of investor money . Between 2000 and 2008 , unit labor costs actually declined slightly in Germany , but rose by 30 % in Spain and Greece . This created an imbalance that put these countries at competitive disadvantage relative to Northern Europe . Returning to full employment at this point requires that the labor costs gap is somehow cancelled . If Spain and Greece had their own currencies , this would have easily happened through exchange rate adjustment . Since they don 't , it can either happen through a decrease in nominal wages in Spain and Greece , also known as \" internal devaluation \" , ( an extremely difficult and slow process , since nominal wages , in general , exhibit downward rigidity ) , or through an equal increase in nominal wages ( i.e. inflation ) in Northern Europe , which does not happen because of active resistance from Germany .",
  "The family Formicidae belongs to the order Hymenoptera , which also includes sawflies , bees , and wasps . Ants evolved from a lineage within the aculeate wasps , and a 2013 study suggests that they are a sister group of the Apoidea . In 1966 , E. O. Wilson and his colleagues identified the fossil remains of an ant ( Sphecomyrma ) that lived in the Cretaceous period . The specimen , trapped in amber dating back to around 92 million years ago , has features found in some wasps , but not found in modern ants . Sphecomyrma possibly was a ground forager , while Haidomyrmex and Haidomyrmodes , related genera in subfamily Sphecomyrminae , are reconstructed as active arboreal predators . Older ants in the genus Sphecomyrmodes have been found in 99 million year @-@ old amber from Myanmar . After the rise of flowering plants about 100 million years ago they diversified and assumed ecological dominance around 60 million years ago . Some groups , such as the Leptanillinae and Martialinae , are suggested to have diversified from early primitive ants that were likely to have been predators underneath the surface of the soil .",

  "A genet is a group of genetically identical individuals that have grown in a given location , all originating vegetatively from a single ancestor . Once established , genets vegetatively spread hyphae out from the root tip into the soil and may connect two or more trees to form a network of mycorrhizae . In field studies , the approximate size of fungal genets is typically estimated by collecting and mapping fruit bodies on a site , determining which fruit bodies are genetically identical by either somatic incompatibility ( a method fungi use to distinguish self from non @-@ self by delimiting their own mycelia from that of other individuals of the same species ) or various molecular techniques , and then determining the distance between identical fruit bodies . In a 1996 study , mycologists Monique Gardes and Thomas Bruns hypothesized that S. pungens , an abundant fruiter in pine forests , would be dominant on the roots of the pine trees . However , by sampling underground ectomycorrhizae in addition to above @-@ ground fruit bodies , they found that the fungus can fruit prolifically while occupying only a small fraction of the ectomycorrhizal root assemblage , which was otherwise dominated by Russula species and Tomentella sublilacina . Gardes and Bruns hypothesized that the disparity between above- and below @-@ ground representation may be because the fungus invests less energy in vegetative growth and persistence and more in fruiting , or alternatively , because the species is particularly efficient at acquiring carbon from its hosts and so needs to colonize only a few rootlets to obtain enough to allow abundant fruiting . A 1998 study by Pierluigi Bonello and colleagues used single @-@ strand conformation polymorphism analysis to detect minute genetic differences among S. pungens genets , and showed that most of the fruiting occurred from a single large genet . This result indicates that the fungus persists because of extensive vegetative growth , rather than frequent establishment of new genets from spores , and that it uses carbon resources efficiently . The study also described an S. pungens genet with an area of approximately 300 m2 ( 3 @,@ 200 sq ft ) and a span greater than 40 m ( 130 ft ) across , which was at the time the largest EM fungal genet reported . The large S. pungens genet was not detected after wildfire , demonstrating that it did not survive in the absence of a host , and suggesting that spores are the primary means by which the fungus recolonizes after a fire .",

  "Eagle @-@ owls are distributed somewhat sparsely but can potentially inhabit a wide range of habitats , with a partiality for irregular topography . They have been found in habitats as diverse as northern coniferous forests to the edge of vast deserts . Essentially , Eurasian eagle @-@ owls have been found living in almost every climatic and environmental condition on the Eurasian continent , excluding the greatest extremities , i.e. they are absent from humid rainforest in Southeast Asia as well as the high Arctic tundra , both of which they are more or less replaced by other variety of Bubo owls . They are often found in the largest numbers in areas where cliffs and ravines are surrounded by a scattering of trees and bushes . However , grassland areas such as alpine meadows or desert @-@ like steppe can also host them so long as they have the cover and protection of rocky areas . The preference of eagle @-@ owls for places with irregular topography has been reported in most known studies . The obvious benefit of such nesting locations is that both nests and daytime roosts located in rocky areas and / or steep slopes would be less accessible to predators , including man . Also , they may be attracted to the vicinity of riparian or wetlands areas , due to the fact that the soft soil of wet areas is conducive to burrowing by the small , terrestrial mammals normally preferred in the diet , such as voles and rabbits . Due to their preference for rocky areas , the species is often found in mountainous areas and can be found up to elevations of 2 @,@ 100 m ( 6 @,@ 900 ft ) in the Alps and 4 @,@ 500 m ( 14 @,@ 800 ft ) in the Himalayas and 4 @,@ 700 m ( 15 @,@ 400 ft ) in the adjacent Tibetan Plateau . However , they can also be found living at sea @-@ level and may nest amongst rocky sea cliffs . Despite their success in areas such as sub @-@ arctic zones and mountainous that are frigid for much of the year , warmer conditions seem to result in more successful breeding attempts per studies in the Eifel region of Germany . In a study from Spain , areas primarily consisting of woodlands ( 52 % of study area being forested ) were preferred with pine trees predominating the oaks in habitats used , as opposed to truly mixed pine @-@ oak woodland . Pine and other coniferous stands are often preferred in great horned owls as well due to the constant density , which make it more likely to overlook the large birds . However , in mountainous forest , they are not generally found in enclosed wooded areas , as is the tawny owl ( Strix alucco ) . Only 2 @.@ 7 % of the habitat included in the territorial ranges for eagle @-@ owls per the habitat study in Spain consisted of cultivated or agricultural land . On the other hand , compared to golden eagles , they can visit cultivated land more regularly in hunting forays due to their nocturnal habits , which allows them to largely evade human activity .

Architecture was of interest mainly to a limited group of wealthy merchants and landowners . However , toward the close of the previous century , this group saw a remarkable increase in prosperity . Large fortunes were made by a few , who then sought to surround themselves with buildings and gardens appropriate to their social position . Well connected internationally , these people were acquainted with the latest trends in architecture . Neoclassical structures were much in demand .",

The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres , a Planetary survey , non @-@ blind research , and other powers to produce \" a nasty and potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down \" . Chris Pine modified the AI to account for the additions . The team also used artwork , sound effects , music , and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart .

The director commented : \" Kaijus are essentially outlandish in a way , but on the other hand they come sort of in families : you 've got the reptilian Kaiju , the insect Kaiju , the sort of crustacean Kaiju ...

The announcement came as a major shock to all sides of politics , not least the members of Bruce 's own cabinet , most of whom had not been informed of the dramatic change in policy until the day it was announced to the states . Bruce calculated that the states would not give up their powers , and thus the move was one designed to sanction the end of Commonwealth arbitration .

  "Whedon used a variety of cinematographic techniques to achieve the dreamlike quality of \" Restless \" .

In Giles ' dream , he walks from a carnival grounds into Spike 's crypt , then through a corridor and straight into The Bronze , three locations not related to one another .

Another example of this occurs when , in Xander 's dream , he walks from the front of the moving ice cream van towards the back , crawls up and over some boxes , through a window , and drops into his basement . In the theater scene during Willow 's dream , a Frazier lens was used to provide a large depth of field , allowing both the foreground and background to be in focus at the same time , while in Xander 's dream , as he moves from room to room in Buffy 's house to the university dorm rooms , Whedon used a 17 mm lens to give a sense of motion as the camera passes by walls . Whedon also used unusual framing for shots , often leaving much of the frame empty , with a character being placed near the bottom or off to the side . The scenes in Spike 's crypt , part of Giles ' dream , were shot in black @-@ and @-@ white to emphasize that Spike is seen as \" an old 30s movie villain \" .",

A few reviewers were critical of Wolf for only touching upon the Internet 's potential impact on reading in her book ; however , in essays published concurrent with the book 's release she elaborated upon her worries . In an essay in The Boston Globe , Wolf expressed her grave concern that the development of knowledge in children who are heavy users of the Internet could produce mere \" decoders of information who have neither the time nor the motivation to think beneath or beyond their googled universes \" , and cautioned that the web 's \" immediacy and volume of information should not be confused with true knowledge \" . In an essay published by Powell 's Books , Wolf contended that some of the reading brain 's strengths could be lost in future generations \" if children are not taught first to read , and to think deeply about their reading , and only then to e @-@ read \" . Preferring to maintain an academic perspective , Wolf firmly asserted that her speculations have not yet been scientifically verified but deserved serious study .",
  "No French reinforcements reached the East Indies in 1797 . A complex strategy had been developed to land an army in Ireland and then use the invasion fleet to attack India as a secondary objective . This ambitious plan collapsed completely during the failed Expédition d 'Irlande in December 1796 in which thousands of French troops were drowned . The strategic situation in Europe had however shifted once more during 1796 when France and Spain signed the Treaty of San Ildefonso , transferring Spain from an ally of Britain to an ally of France . British attention in the East Indies therefore shifted from the French island territories to the Spanish Philippines , where the defence squadron had been badly damaged in a hurricane in April 1797 and was in dock for extensive repairs . British forces were once again in the ascendant , Rainier commanding five ships of the line , one fourth rate ship and six frigates . Extensive plans were developed by Rainier in conjunction with Sir John Shore , Governor @-@ General of India , and Colonel Arthur Wellesley for a major attack on Manila , to be led by Sir James Craig . The Treaty of Campo Formio and the consequent end of the War of the First Coalition in Europe caused the cancellation of these plans ; Britain now fought France and its allies alone and fears were raised that the Tipu Sultan of Mysore might once again attack British colonies in India . To ensure the safety of the 1798 China Fleet from Spanish attack , in July 1797 Rainier deployed Centurion , HMS Sybille and HMS Fox to escort a convoy of East Indiamen to Macau . After seeing his charges into harbour in December , Captain Edward Cooke investigated Manila himself in Sybille , accompanied by Fox . There he discovered the weak state of the Spanish squadron .",

  "Levine confirmed in March 2013 that the film has been officially cancelled . Levine stated that after Warner 's Watchmen film in 2009 did not do as well as the studio expected , they had concerns with the $ 200 million budget that Verbinski had for the BioShock film . They asked him to consider doing the film on a smaller $ 80 million budget , but Verbinski did not want to accept this . Universal then subsequently brought in a new director to work with the smaller budget , but Levine and 2K Games did not feel that the new director was a good fit with the material . Universal then let Levine make the decision to end the project , which he did believing that the film would not work with the current set of compromises they would have had to make .

  "During the 1848 turmoil in Germany , Albert had been constructing his own liberal reform plan , under which a single monarch , chancellor , and parliament would unite the German states ; in addition , each state would retain its own current ruling dynasty . As this plan pertained to his brother , Ernest was given a copy in the hope that he would develop his own liberal constitution . Ernest subsequently made a few concessions , but his position remained sound , not counting the increasing problem of his debts . A constitution was drafted and promulgated in 1849 in Gotha , though one had existed in Coburg since 1821 . In 1852 , both constitutions were converged into one , which converted the personal union of the two duchies into a real union ; the duchies were now inseparable , with a common set of institutions . During the political turmoil , timely concessions and Ernest 's popular habit of mingling with \" the people in their pleasures \" were instrumental in keeping him from losing his throne . Furthermore , various contemporary sources state that Ernest was an able , just and very popular ruler , which may have also helped keep him in power .",

  "Termites were previously regarded as a separate order Isoptera to cockroaches . However , recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that they evolved directly from ' true ' cockroaches , and many authors now place them as an \" epifamily \" of Blattodea . This evidence supported a hypothesis suggested in 1934 that termites are closely related to the wood @-@ eating cockroaches ( genus Cryptocercus ) . This hypothesis was originally based on similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in termites regarded as living fossils and wood @-@ eating cockroaches . Additional evidence emerged when F. A. McKittrick ( 1965 ) noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and cockroach nymphs . The similarities among these cockroaches and termites have led some scientists to reclassify termites as a single family , the Termitidae , within the order Blattodea . Other scientists have taken a more conservative approach , proposing to retain the termites as the Termitoidae , an epifamily within the order . Such measure preserves the classification of termites at family level and below .",

Suffering a minor concussion from the hit and a hyper @-@ extended elbow when he fell to the ice , he missed three games due to his injuries . While Moore was unpenalized for the hit , some Canucks players felt that it was a \" cheap shot \" . In the second rematch of the two teams after Moore 's hit on Naslund , Vancouver allegedly put a \" bounty \" on Moore and were out to make him \" pay a price \" . Early in the game , Moore clashed with Cooke , but later refused to fight Bertuzzi , despite being taunted and followed around the ice . After being refused the fight , Bertuzzi punched Moore in the head from behind and slammed him into the ice . Bertuzzi was subsequently suspended indefinitely by the NHL , and the resulting injuries ended Moore 's career and left him suffering from concussion symptoms over the following seven years . Despite the loss of Bertuzzi , the Canucks won the Northwest Division . In the opening round Vancouver faced their division rival Calgary Flames . In the series Vancouver fell behind three games to two . They took a 4 – 0 lead in game six before the Flames came back to tie the game and send it to overtime .

  "In September 1941 Japan began its southward expansion by expanding its military presence in Indochina ( \" securing ' points d 'appui ' \" ) and decisively increased the number of stationed personnel and planes . This provoked the United States , the United Kingdom , and other Western governments to freeze Japanese assets , while the US ( which supplied 80 percent of Japan 's oil ) responded by placing a complete oil embargo on the Japanese Empire . As a result , Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in South @-@ East Asia and its prosecution of the war against China , or seizing the natural resources it needed by force .

Moreover , many officers considered America 's oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war .

  "On February 12 , 1982 , following the poor sales of the medallions , the United States Gold Commission recommended the minting of a gold coin . Donald Regan , Secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the commission , later told reporters that a gold coin could be easier to sell than medallions , because the suggested coins \" could be redeemable in dollars \" . The Mint issued gold coins for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty in 1986 . Both issues were successful , and the Liberty piece sold out on advance sales . As the public was receptive to the gold coins , and President Ronald Reagan had banned the importation of Krugerrands in 1985 over South Africa 's apartheid policy , Congress authorized the American Gold Eagle gold bullion coin , which entered production as legal tender in 1986 .",
  "The Macdonald government took practical steps to promote tourism as a way of bringing money into the province . It improved conditions for tourists by granting small loans to hotel , motel and cottage owners to upgrade their facilities . It also offered cooking classes to restaurant and hotel employees . The government 's extensive road building program made it easier for tourists to travel . But biographer Stephen Henderson writes that Macdonald went well beyond these practical steps to promote Nova Scotia as a beautiful and rustic place peopled by colourful Scots , Acadians , Germans and Mi 'kmaq . Government advertising portrayed the province \" as a place where urban , middle @-@ class families could go to ' step back in time ' \" . Gradually , Henderson maintains , the tourism campaigns created a new identity for Nova Scotians . \" They witnessed the provincial state constructing an elaborate network of modern roads ; they read books and brochures extolling the beauty of the province , and they heard their premier waxing romantically about the pure , simple nobility of their ancestors . \" Macdonald was especially enthusiastic about \" the romanticized culture of the Highland Scots \" . Historian Ian McKay writes that under his leadership , the provincial government gave money to the Gaelic College ; bestowed Scottish names on key tourism sites and stationed \" a brawny Scots piper \" at the border with New Brunswick . Macdonald also helped assemble more than a quarter of a million acres ( 4 @,@ 000 km2 ) for the Cape Breton Highlands National Park complete with a fancy resort hotel and world @-@ class golf course . \" Macdonald believed \" , Henderson writes , \" he had created a piece of Scotland for tourists in the New World \" .
