  "The album opens with the Zedd remix of \" Born This Way \" which begins with some minimalist beat followed by loud synths , and consists of a techno breakdown .

The remix of \" Black Jesus + Amen Fashion \" retains the most of the composition of its original counterpart , although it introduces a new synth by Michael Woods , thus turning it into a rave @-@ trance track . The Horrors remix of Born This Way album track \" Bloody Mary \" consisted of Gaga 's vocals fading in and out of sequence . \" Scheiße \" featured influences from The Knife song \" Heartbeats \" ( 2003 ) as well as Vengaboys ' \" We Like to Party \" ( 1999 ) . \" Electric Chapel \" ' s composition is completely changed by Two Door Cinema , altering the dark mood of the song to a fun and engaging one .

  "Also contained in Hemming 's work is a description of the lawsuit between the diocese of Worcester and Evesham Abbey , which took place between 1078 and 1085 . Although only Hemming relates the course of the proceedings , the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham , or Evesham Chronicle , also gives background information on the dispute . The litigation involved lands that the abbey held in Hampton and Bengeworth in Worcestershire , but that the diocese maintained were actually part of one of the bishopric 's manors . Ownership became disputed under the abbacy of Æthelwig , when the abbot managed to acquire the allegiance of a number of the new owners of lands previously held from the diocese . After Æthelwig 's death , most of these lands passed to Odo of Bayeux , but Evesham managed to retain Hampton and Bengeworth , which became the basis of the dispute .

After the Conquest , Azur 's lands were given to Urse d 'Abetot , the Sheriff of Worcester . Following Æthelwig 's death , Wulfstan was able to secure a settlement with Æthelwig 's successor Walter .

  "Liquid argon is used as the target for neutrino experiments and direct dark matter searches . The interaction between the hypothetical WIMP particle and an argon nucleus produces scintillation light that is detected by photomultiplier tubes . Two @-@ phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP @-@ nucleus scattering . As with most other liquefied noble gases , argon has a high scintillation light yield ( c . 51 photons / keV ) , is transparent to its own scintillation light , and is relatively easy to purify . Compared to xenon , argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile which allows the separation of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils . On the other hand , its intrinsic beta @-@ ray background is larger due to 39Ar contamination , unless one uses argon from underground sources , which has much less 39Ar contamination . Most of the argon in the Earth ’ s atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long @-@ lived 40K ( 40K + e − → 40Ar + ν ) present in natural potassium within the earth . The 39Ar activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through 40Ar ( n , 2n ) 39Ar and similar reactions . The half @-@ life of 39Ar is only 269 years . As a result , the underground Ar , shielded by rock and water , has much less 39Ar contamination .

  "The French pharmacologist Raphaël Dubois carried out work on bioluminescence in the late nineteenth century . He studied click beetles ( Pyrophorus ) and the marine bivalve mollusc Pholas dactylus . He refuted the old idea that bioluminescence came from phosphorus , and demonstrated that the process was related to the oxidation of a specific compound , which he named luciferin , by an enzyme . He sent Harvey siphons from the mollusc preserved in sugar . Harvey had become interested in bioluminescence as a result of visiting the South Pacific and Japan and observing phosphorescent organisms there . He studied the phenomenon for many years . His research aimed to demonstrate that luciferin , and the enzymes that act on it is to produce light , were interchangeable between species , showing that all bioluminescent organisms had a common ancestor .

The writers hoped the time jump would also help them avoid repeating mistakes they made during the show 's poorly received second season , during which they relied heavily on storylines from the previous season . Cherry said that the time jump would be permanent , with executive producer Bob Daily clarifying that some brief flashback scenes would be used to enhance the storytelling and provide context for current plot lines . Cherry had originally wanted to do a ten @-@ year jump , mostly to age the young characters into their teenage years in order to open up more storyline possibilities .",

  "Sellers left the production before all his scenes were shot , which is why his character , Tremble , is so abruptly captured in the film . Whether Sellers was fired or simply walked off is unclear . Given that he often went absent for days at a time and was involved in conflicts with Welles , either explanation is plausible . Regardless , Sellers was unavailable for the filming of an ending and of linking footage to explain the details , leaving the filmmakers to devise a way to make the existing footage work without him . The framing device of a beginning and ending with David Niven was invented to salvage the footage . Val Guest said that he was given the task of creating a narrative thread which would link all segments of the film . He chose to use the original Bond and Vesper as linking characters to tie the story together . In the originally released versions of the film , a cardboard cutout of Sellers in the background was used for the final scenes . In later versions , this cardboard cutout was replaced by footage of Sellers in highland dress , inserted by \" trick photography \" .",

  "The Treaty of Traverse des Sioux in 1851 gave all of the Wahpeton and Sisseton Sioux ( upper Sioux ) lands west of the Mississippi River to the U.S. government . The Treaty of Mendota that same year ceded the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute Sioux ( lower Sioux ) lands in southern Minnesota , requiring relocation to an area near modern Morton .

  "The Virginia Plan , if implemented , would base representation in both houses of the federal legislature on population . This was unsatisfactory to the smaller states . Delaware 's delegates had been instructed to seek an equal vote for each state , and this became the New Jersey Plan , introduced by that state 's governor , William Paterson . The divisions in the convention became apparent in late June , when by a narrow vote , the convention voted that representation in the lower house be based on population , but the motion of Connecticut 's Oliver Ellsworth for each state to have an equal vote in the upper house failed on a tie . With the convention deadlocked , on July 2 , 1787 , a Grand Committee was formed , with one member from each state , to seek a way out . Mason had not taken as strong a position on the legislature as had Madison , and he was appointed to the committee ; Mason and Benjamin Franklin were the most prominent members . The committee met over the convention 's July 4 recess , and proposed what became known as the Great Compromise : a House of Representatives based on population , in which money bills must originate , and a Senate with equal representation for each state . Records do not survive of Mason 's participation in that committee , but the clause requiring money bills to start in the House most likely came from him or was the price of his support , as he had inserted such a clause in the Virginia Constitution , and he defended that clause once convention debate resumed . According to Madison 's notes , Mason urged the convention to adopt the compromise :",

  "The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the French colonial power . In the popular view , the link between Ambohimanga and the ancestors ( Andrianampoinimerina in particular ) rendered the royal city an even more potent symbol and source of legitimate power than the capital of Antananarivo , which was seen as having become a locus of corrupt politics and deviance from ancestral tradition . Believing that the presence of the ancestors within the tombs sanctified the earth upon which the rova was built , Menalamba resistance fighters would come to Ambohimanga to collect handfuls of dirt from the base of the tombs to carry with them in their offensives against the French ; the French authority intended by the removal of the sovereigns ' bodies from the tombs to undermine the fighters ' confidence and solidarity . Although the tombs were desecrated and the Menalamba fighters were ultimately defeated , Ambohimanga has retained its sacred character .

  "Likewise , when working with polynomials , it is often necessary to assign <formula> the value 1 . A polynomial is an expression of the form <formula> where x is an indeterminate , and the coefficients <formula> are real numbers ( or , more generally , elements of some ring ) . The set of all real polynomials in x is denoted by <formula> . Polynomials are added termwise , and multiplied by the applying the usual rules for exponents in the indeterminate x ( see Cauchy product ) . With these algebraic rules for manipulation , polynomials form a polynomial ring . The polynomial <formula> is the identity element of the polynomial ring , meaning that it is the ( unique ) element such that the product of <formula> with any polynomial <formula> is just <formula> . Polynomials can be evaluated by specializing the indeterminate x to be a real number . More precisely , for any given real number <formula> there is a unique unital ring homomorphism <formula> such that <formula> . This is called the evaluation homomorphism . Because it is a unital homomorphism , we have <formula> That is , <formula> for all specializations of x to a real number ( including zero ) .",

  "In the reproductive system of butterflies and moths , the male genitalia are complex and unclear . In females the three types of genitalia are based on the relating taxa : ' monotrysian ' , ' exoporian ' , and ' ditrysian ' . In the monotrysian type is an opening on the fused segments of the sterna 9 and 10 , which act as insemination and oviposition . In the exoporian type ( in Hepaloidae and Mnesarchaeoidea ) are two separate places for insemination and oviposition , both occurring on the same sterna as the monotrysian type , i.e. 9 and 10 . The ditrysian groups have an internal duct that carries sperm , with separate openings for copulation and egg @-@ laying . In most species , the genitalia are flanked by two soft lobes , although they may be specialized and sclerotized in some species for ovipositing in area such as crevices and inside plant tissue . Hormones and the glands that produce them run the development of butterflies and moths as they go through their lifecycles , called the endocrine system . The first insect hormone prothoracicotropic hormone ( PTTH ) operates the species lifecycle and diapause . This hormone is produced by corpora allata and corpora cardiaca , where it is also stored . Some glands are specialized to perform certain task such as producing silk or producing saliva in the palpi . While the corpora cardiaca produce PTTH , the corpora allata also produces juvenile hormones , and the prothorocic glands produce moulting hormones .",

  "The phylum was originally called \" Polyzoa \" , but this name was soon replaced by Ehrenberg 's term \" Bryozoa \" . The name \" Bryozoa \" was originally applied only to the animals also known as \" Ectoprocta \" , in which the anus lies outside the \" crown \" of tentacles ( based on the Ancient Greek prefix ἐκτο meaning \" outside \" and word πρωκτος meaning \" anus \" ) . After the discovery of the Entoprocta , in which the anus lies within a \" crown \" of tentacles ( based on the Ancient Greek prefix ἐντο meaning \" inside \" and word πρωκτος meaning \" anus \" ) , the name \" Bryozoa \" was used at phylum level to include the two classes Ectoprocta and Entoprocta .

Despite their apparently similar methods of feeding , they differed markedly anatomically ; in addition to the different positions of the anus , ectoprocts have hollow tentacles and a coelom , while entoprocts have solid tentacles and no coelom .

  "Wally Snell once considered Boletus carolinensis to be the sames species as B. curtisii . He claimed that the former species was then considered distinct from the latter by virtue of an even , instead of reticulate ( netlike ) stem , although they were otherwise quite similar in appearance and spore size and shape . Snell explained that although neither the English nor the Latin text of Berkeley 's original description mentioned a reticulated stem , a later ( 1872 ) description by Berkeley characterized the stem as reticulato . Snell thought that this might have been an error in transcription , or an error in the species account , as herbarium specimens that he had examined lacked this feature . He changed his mind a couple of years later , when he found a small amount of reticulation in material collected by Peck .",

  "Plumage is regularly moulted ; the standard plumage of a bird that has moulted after breeding is known as the \" non @-@ breeding \" plumage , or — in the Humphrey @-@ Parkes terminology — \" basic \" plumage ; breeding plumages or variations of the basic plumage are known under the Humphrey @-@ Parkes system as \" alternate \" plumages . Moulting is annual in most species , although some may have two moults a year , and large birds of prey may moult only once every few years . Moulting patterns vary across species . In passerines , flight feathers are replaced one at a time with the innermost primary being the first . When the fifth of sixth primary is replaced , the outermost tertiaries begin to drop . After the innermost tertiaries are moulted , the secondaries starting from the innermost begin to drop and this proceeds to the outer feathers ( centrifugal moult ) . The greater primary coverts are moulted in synchrony with the primary that they overlap . A small number of species , such as ducks and geese , lose all of their flight feathers at once , temporarily becoming flightless . As a general rule , the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair . Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae . The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers , in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail . The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward , secondaries inward , and the tail from center outward . Before nesting , the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly . The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation .",

Schickel sees the film as one of the definitive romantic pictures of the period , but remarks that Grant was not entirely successful in trying to supersede the film 's \" gushing sentimentality \" . That year , Grant also appeared opposite Sophia Loren in The Pride and the Passion . He had expressed an interest in playing William Holden 's character in The Bridge on the River Kwai at the time , but found that it was not possible because of his commitment to The Pride and the Passion . The film was shot on location in Spain and was problematic , with co @-@ star Frank Sinatra irritating his colleagues and leaving the production after just a few weeks . Grant 's attempts to woo Loren during the production proved fruitless , which led to him expressing anger when Paramount cast her opposite him in Houseboat ( 1958 ) as part of her contract . The sexual tension between the two was so great during the making of Houseboat that the producers found it almost impossible to make . Later in 1958 , Grant starred opposite Bergman in the romantic comedy Indiscreet , playing a successful financier who has an affair with a famous actress ( Bergman ) while pretending to be a married man . During the filming he formed a closer friendship and gained new respect for her as an actress . Schickel stated that he thought the film was possibly the finest romantic comedy film of the era , and that Grant himself had professed that it was one of his personal favorites .

  "Emsleyan or Mertensian mimicry describes unusual cases where deadly prey mimic a less dangerous species . It was first proposed by Emsley as a possible answer for the theoretical difficulties a predator species faces when associating an aposematic phenotype of potentially dangerous animals , such as the coral snake , with unprofitability when the predator has an increased risk of death , negating any learned behaviour . The theory was developed by the German biologist Wolfgang Wickler in a chapter of Mimicry in Plants and Animals , who named it after the German herpetologist Robert Mertens . Sheppard points out that Hecht and Marien put forward a similar hypothesis ten years earlier . This scenario is a little more difficult to understand , since in other types of mimicry it is usually the most harmful species that is the model . But if a predator dies , it cannot learn to recognize a warning signal , e.g. , bright colors in a certain pattern . In other words , there is no advantage in being aposematic for an organism that is likely to kill any predator it succeeds in poisoning ; such an animal is better off being camouflaged , to avoid attacks altogether . If , however , there were some other species that were harmful but not deadly as well as aposematic , the predator could learn to recognize its particular warning colors and avoid such animals . A deadly species could then profit by mimicking the less dangerous aposematic organism if this reduces the number of attacks . The exception here , ignoring any chance of animals learning by watching a conspecific die ( see Jouventin et al. for a discussion of observational learning and mimicry ) , is the possibility of not having to learn that it is harmful in the first place : instinctive genetic programming to be wary of certain signals . In this case , other organisms could benefit from this programming , and Batesian or Müllerian mimics of it could potentially evolve . In fact , it has been shown that some species do have an innate recognition of certain aposematic warnings . Hand @-@ reared turquoise @-@ browed motmots ( Eumomota superciliosa ) , avian predators , instinctively avoid snakes with red and yellow rings . Other colors with the same pattern , and even red and yellow stripes with the same width as rings , were tolerated . However , models with red and yellow rings were feared , with the birds flying away and giving alarm calls in some cases . This provides an alternative explanation to Mertensian mimicry . See Greene and McDiarmid for a review of the subject .",

  "Due to these limitations , a new infantry anti @-@ tank weapon was required , and this ultimately came in the form of the Projector , Infantry , Anti @-@ Tank , commonly abbreviated to PIAT . The origins of the PIAT can be traced back as far as 1888 , when an American engineer by the name of Charles Edward Munroe was experimenting with guncotton ; he discovered that the explosive would yield a great deal more damage if there were a recess in it facing the target . This phenomenon is known as the ' Munroe effect ' . The German scientist Egon Neumann , found that lining the recess with metal enhanced the damage dealt even more . By the 1930s Henry Mohaupt , a Swiss engineer , had developed this technology even further and created hollow charge ammunition . This consisted of a recessed metal cone placed into an explosive warhead ; when the warhead hit its target , the explosive detonated and turned the cone into an extremely high @-@ speed spike . The speed of the spike , and the immense pressure it caused on impact , allowed it to create a small hole in armour plating and send a large pressure wave and large amounts of fragments into the interior of the target .

Calculations on its ionization potentials , atomic radius , as well as radii , orbital energies , and ground levels of its ionized states are similar to that of hafnium and very different from that of lead . Therefore , it was concluded that rutherfordium 's basic properties will resemble those of other group 4 elements , below titanium , zirconium , and hafnium . Some of its properties were determined by gas @-@ phase experiments and aqueous chemistry .

Hydrology grades depend on the amount of pavement and other impervious surfaces in the watershed and to what degree its streams flow freely , not dammed or diverted . Water @-@ quality grades are based on measurements of dissolved oxygen , E @-@ coli bacteria , temperature , suspended solids , and substances such as mercury and phosphorus . Habitat ranking depends on the condition of stream banks and floodplains , riparian zones , tree canopies , and other variables . The fish and wildlife assessment includes birds , fish , and macroinvertebrates . In 2015 , the BES grades for Johnson Creek are hydrology , B + ; water quality , C + ; habitat , C , and fish and wildlife , D + .",

Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history , including the gold rush , the building of the railroads and cattle herding on the Great Plains . A career as a scout for the Army under General Phillip Sheridan following the Civil War earned him his nickname and established his notoriety as a frontiersman .",
  "It was evident that everyone would suspect trickery . If a bomb were exploded in Japan with previous notice , the Japanese air power was still adequate to give serious interference . An atomic bomb was an intricate device , still in the developmental stage . Its operation would be far from routine . If during the final adjustments of the bomb the Japanese defenders should attack , a faulty move might easily result in some kind of failure . Such an end to an advertised demonstration of power would be much worse than if the attempt had not been made . It was now evident that when the time came for the bombs to be used we should have only one of them available , followed afterwards by others at all @-@ too @-@ long intervals . We could not afford the chance that one of them might be a dud . If the test were made on some neutral territory , it was hard to believe that Japan 's determined and fanatical military men would be impressed . If such an open test were made first and failed to bring surrender , the chance would be gone to give the shock of surprise that proved so effective . On the contrary , it would make the Japanese ready to interfere with an atomic attack if they could . Though the possibility of a demonstration that would not destroy human lives was attractive , no one could suggest a way in which it could be made so convincing that it would be likely to stop the war .",

  "Hillforts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron ages , around the start of the first millennium BC . The reason for their emergence in prehistoric Britain and their purpose has been a subject of debate . It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe , sites built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture . The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain . Deposits of iron ore were located in different places from the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze and , as a result , trading patterns shifted . The old elites lost their economic and social status and power passed into the hands of a new group of people .",

Likewise , St. Augustine believed Virgil was referencing Christ ; he assumed that the poet was writing poetically , since he was writing in the \" shadowy \" persona of an unnamed narrator , but he was also writing with veracity , since any traces of guilt \" could be wiped away only by that Savior concerning whom the verse was written . \" Echoing the sentiment of Lactantius , St. Augustine opined that the mention of Cumae in line 4 is a reference to the supposed Sibylline prophecy concerning Christ .

  "Pickering assigned Leavitt to study \" variable stars , \" whose luminosity varies over time . According to science writer Jeremy Bernstein , \" variable stars had been of interest for years , but when she was studying those plates , I doubt Pickering thought she would make a significant discovery — one that would eventually change astronomy . \" Leavitt noted thousands of variable stars in images of the Magellanic Clouds . In 1908 she published her results in the Annals of the Astronomical Observatory of Harvard College , noting that a few of the variables showed a pattern : brighter ones appeared to have longer periods . After further study , she confirmed in 1912 that the Cepheid variables with greater intrinsic luminosity did have longer periods , and that the relationship was quite close and predictable .",

  "Regardless of what happened in 1921 , Jardine 's conflicts with Australia solidified after he was selected to tour the country in 1928 – 29 . He began the tour with three consecutive hundreds . During the first century , the crowd engaged in some good @-@ natured joking at Jardine 's expense , but he was jeered by the crowd during his second hundred for batting too slowly . Jardine accelerated after another slow start , during which he was again barracked to score his third century . The crowds took an increasing dislike to him , mainly for his superior attitude and bearing , his awkward fielding , and particularly his choice of headwear . His first public action in South Australia was to take out the members of the South Australian team who had been to Oxford or Cambridge universities . Then , he wore a Harlequin cap , given to successful cricketers at Oxford . It was not unusual for Oxford and Cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting , as both Jardine and MCC captain Percy Chapman did so on this tour , although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding . However , this was neither understood nor acceptable to the Australian crowds . They quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction . Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition , it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators ; his general demeanour drew one comment of \" Where 's the butler to carry the bat for you ? \" Jardine 's cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour . Nevertheless , Jack Fingleton later claimed that Jardine could have won over the crowd by exchanging jokes or pleasantries with them . It is certain that Jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds . During his third century at the start of the tour , during a period of abuse from the spectators , he observed to a sympathetic Hunter Hendry that \" All Australians are uneducated , and an unruly mob \" . After the innings , when teammate Patsy Hendren remarked that the Australian crowds did not like Jardine , he replied \" It 's fucking mutual \" . During the tour , Jardine fielded next to the crowd on the boundary . There , he was roundly abused and mocked for his awkward fielding , particularly when chasing the ball . On one occasion , he spat towards the crowd while fielding on the boundary as he changed position for the final time .",

  "Throughout the history of fabric production natural dyes have been used to apply a form of colour , with dyes from plants , including indigo from Woad , having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate ; therefore giving rise to variations in shade . In the case of the Saltire , variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue . When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century , the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly selected on the basis of the durability of darker dyes , with this dark blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land . Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the Saltire itself , leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland .",

The Ottoman conquests initiated a westward migration of parts of the Croatian population ; the Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of some of those settlers . To replace the fleeing Croats the Habsburgs called on the Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier .

Another popular view among critics of the bombings , originating with Gar Alperovitz in 1965 and becoming the default position in Japanese school history textbooks , is the idea of atomic diplomacy : that the United States used nuclear weapons in order to intimidate the Soviet Union in the early stages of the Cold War .

  "A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world , and the world 's geometry therefore as sacred . The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins . Plutarch attributed the belief to Plato , writing that \" Plato said God geometrizes continually \" ( Convivialium disputationum , liber 8 @,@ 2 ) . This image has influenced Western thought ever since . The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a Pythagorean notion of harmony in music , where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions , corresponding to the lengths of the lyre 's strings ; indeed , the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number . In the same way , in Platonic thought , the regular or Platonic solids dictate the proportions found in nature , and in art . A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament : \" When he established the heavens I was there : when he set a compass upon the face of the deep \" ( Proverbs 8 : 27 ) , showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses . In 1596 , the mathematical astronomer Johannes Kepler modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids , determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets . William Blake 's Ancient of Days and his painting of the physicist Isaac Newton , naked and drawing with a compass , attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world , as in a different way does Salvador Dali 's 1954 Crucifixion ( Corpus Hypercubus ) , which depicts the cross as a hypercube , representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three . In Dali 's The Sacrament of the Last Supper ( 1955 ) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant dodecahedron .",

  "As of 2009 , Malawi exports an estimated US $ 945 million in goods per year . The country 's heavy reliance on tobacco places a heavy burden on the economy as world prices decline and the international community increases pressure to limit tobacco production . Malawi 's dependence on tobacco is growing , with the product jumping from 53 % to 70 % of export revenues between 2007 and 2008 . The country also relies heavily on tea , sugar and coffee , with these three plus tobacco making up more than 90 % of Malawi 's export revenue . Because of a rise in costs and a decline in sales prices , Malawi is encouraging farmers away from tobacco towards more profitable crops , including spices such as paprika . India hemp is another possible alternative , but arguments have been made that it will bring more crime to the country through its resemblance to varieties of cannabis used as a recreational drug and the difficulty in distinguishing between the two types . This concern is especially important because the cultivation of Malawian cannabis , known as Malawi Gold , as a drug has increased significantly . Malawi is known for growing \" the best and finest \" cannabis in the world for recreational drug use , according to a recent World Bank report , and cultivation and sales of the crop may contribute to corruption within the police force .",

  "In the early 1870s during the Grant Administration , lucrative postal route contracts were given to local contractors on the Pacific Coast and Southern regions of the United States . These were known as Star Routes because an asterisk was given on official Post Office documents . These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy . In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts , an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office ; the ring consisted of contractors , postal clerks , and various intermediary brokers . Straw bidding was at its highest practice while John Creswell , Grant 's 1869 appointment , was Postmaster @-@ General . An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell , but he was censured by the minority House report .

  "DJ Hero primarily simulates turntablism , a musical style used by disc jockeys to create a new mashup song by incorporating one or more previously recorded songs played on record players along with sound effect generators . The game features score attack gameplay similar to the Guitar Hero games . The controller consists of a wireless deck consisting of a movable turntable that supports 3 \" stream \" buttons , an effects dial , a crossfader , and a \" Euphoria \" button ; a hidden panel contains additional controller buttons to interact with the gaming console outside of the game . A portion of the controller can be detached and reattached to adapt the unit for left @-@ handed players . Notes travel in an arc across a spinning record on screen , and the player holds down one of the 3 stream buttons to play notes ; two buttons reflect the two songs used in that particular mix , and the third represents samples to add to the mix which can be adjusted with the effects dial . The player must also constantly adjust the crossfader to match onscreen symbols , which alters the relative volume of the songs as to bring one song to the forefront of the mix for a short time . Certain tracks are shown on screen as a series of up or down arrow , representing scratching sections , requiring the player to turn the turntable in the direction of the arrows while holding down the button to score points , mimicking the scratching of the record needle on vinyl albums . \" Euphoria \" is equivalent to Guitar Hero 's Star Power , collected by successfully completing specific phrases in the song mix , called Perfect Regions , and can be released by pressing the Euphoria button , doubling the player 's current multiplier as well as automatic crossfading when active . There is also a \" Rewind \" meter that builds through consistent successful playing , and once full , allows the player to rewind the song to fix errors in their performance . The player must continue to perform well or their performance meter will drop and the music track will cut out . Failing the song is not possible , unlike in Guitar Hero games .",

  "Key to the affirmative reading of \" Ulysses \" is the biographical context of the poem . Such a reading takes into account Tennyson 's statements about writing the poem — \" the need of going forward \" — and considers that he would not undermine Ulysses ' determination with irony when he needed a similar stalwartness to face life after Hallam 's death . Ulysses is thus seen as an heroic character whose determination to seek \" some work of noble note \" ( 52 ) is courageous in the face of a \" still hearth \" ( 2 ) and old age . The passion and conviction of Tennyson 's language — and even his own comments on the poem — signify that the poet , as was typical in the Victorian age , admired courage and persistence . Read straightforwardly , \" Ulysses \" promotes the questing spirit of youth , even in old age , and a refusal to resign and face life passively .",

  "This rockfowl builds its nest onto the sides of rocks , normally in caves , where nests are built both by the entrance and deep within , or on nearly vertical cliff faces , which can be either bare or have some vegetation , though never woody branches , near the nest . Nests need to be built under an overhang to protect it from water , and the rock surface normally slopes forward slightly . The nests are almost always found near water , which can be in the form of either streams or forest pools . These streams , particularly those located at the base of a nesting cliff , help keep predators away from the nests . Nests on rock surfaces are normally built 1 @.@ 2 to 5 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 to 17 @.@ 1 ft ) above the ground . In addition to the rock face nests , there is a record of a nest being constructed on the buttress root of a Piptadeniastrum tree above a small stream . Two nests were even built onto a concrete bridge in Gabon 's Lopé National Park . The male and female rockfowl work equally on the nest 's construction , and it can take two to three months to build one , though in some extreme cases it takes more than a year . The nest itself is a half @-@ cup constructed of dry mud with grass fibres and dead leaves mixed in , often with the plant matter sticking out of the nest 's walls . It is either built onto the rock surface or , in some cases , is built more like a retaining wall across the opening of a small rock fissure . Nests are built at least away 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) from each other , and in some cases up to 5 metres ( 16 ft ) . The nest is normally 30 to 40 centimetres ( 12 to 16 in ) thick , though the nest is uneven in its construction and one nest was 140 centimetres ( 55 in ) thick . It is about 290 centimetres ( 110 in ) wide and 400 centimetres ( 160 in ) long and weighs about 3 kilograms ( 6 @.@ 6 lb ) . However , nest sizes do have a large degree of variability . After the mud dries , it becomes a very hard structure . The inside of the nest is lined with rootlets and thin strips of grass .",

  "Fishing for herring and cod also grew in importance during the 19th century . Herring fishing was expanding generally in Scotland at that time , with fishing stations being set up in remote areas . Herring fishing began in 1814 on Stronsay and soon spread throughout the Orkney Islands . By the middle of the century , Shapinsay had 50 herring boats . Cod became important largely because the Napoleonic Wars forced English fishing boats to fish further north . Local fishermen , who had been catching fish using lines from small boats for centuries , also began trawling for cod . However , this was largely a part @-@ time venture , unlike in Shetland , where many inhabitants made a living from fishing . A saying originating from this time states , \" a Shetlander is a fisherman with a croft , while an Orcadian is a farmer with a boat . \" Consequently , fishermen from outside the Orkney Islands earned a large share of the profits . Helliar Holm 's beaches were used to dry both herring and cod after they had been salted .

The shell is composed of two valves , each of which is convex and has a small number of broad ribs covered with blunt spines . These radiate from the umbone , the rounded protuberance near the hinge , and between them are fine etched striations . The background colour is white with radial bands of pale purple and the right valve , which is usually underneath , is paler than the left . The annual growth rings are visible , often as concentric bands of a different hue . Beside the hinge are two irregular shell flaps or auricles with the anterior one normally being much larger than the other .

In addition , persons posing as \" Indian Attorneys \" charged Indian tribes money for bogus representation in Washington D.C.

Allen Robinson caught 11 passes , and was the only Penn State receiver with more than three catches . The shuffled offensive line on which Donovan Smith did not start , \" yes , allowed a sack , and yes , committed a few penalties , but generally opened up gaping holes in the run game , gave Hackenberg plenty of time to throw , and controlled the line of scrimmage \" .

  "In August 1943 and March 1944 , the Polish Underground State announced its long @-@ term plan , which was partly designed to undercut the attractiveness of some of the communists ' proposals . The communists , in their increasingly radical What We Fight For declarations ( from March and November 1943 ) , were proposing the creation of a heavily socialist or even communist state , denouncing capitalism , which they equated to slavery . They demanded nationalization of most if not all of the economy , introduction of central planning , The Underground State 's declaration What the Polish Nation is Fighting For declared the reconstruction of Poland as a democratic parliamentary state as its goal , guaranteeing full equality to the minorities , as well as full freedom of speech , freedom of religion , and freedom of political activity . The plan also called for the creation of a Central European federal union , without domination by any single state . In the economic sector , planned economy would be endorsed , by embracing the socialist and Christian Democrat principles , such as income redistribution , aiming at a reduction of economic inequality . The plan promised land reform , nationalization of the industrial base , demands for territorial compensation from Germany , and re @-@ establishment of the country 's pre @-@ 1939 eastern border . According to the plan , the country 's Eastern borders , as delineated by the 1921 Treaty of Riga , would be kept while in the north and west compensation would be sought from German territories . Thus , the main differences between the Underground State and the communists , in terms of politics , were not rooted in radical economic and social reforms , which both sides advocated , but rather in their divergent positions on such issues as national sovereignty , borders , and Polish @-@ Soviet relations . The program was criticized by the nationalist factions , for being too socialist , and not \" Christian \" enough .",

The next 34 ballots passed with no one near victory , and still no votes for Pierce . The Buchanan team decided to have their delegates vote for minor candidates , including Pierce , to demonstrate that no one but Buchanan could win . It was hoped that once delegates realized this , the convention would unite behind Buchanan . This novel tactic backfired after several ballots as Virginia , New Hampshire , and Maine switched to Pierce ; the remaining Buchanan forces began to break for Marcy , and before long Pierce was in third place .

The oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 66 million years ago , around the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs . In early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages : one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely serrated teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark , and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth . These sharks attained gigantic proportions and include the extinct megatoothed shark , C. megalodon .

  "In 1822 , crews from Jesus and Brasenose raced each other to become Head of the River . One Brasenose rower apparently \" caught a crab \" , slowing the boat . The Brasenose boat was bumped by the Jesus boat , but rowed on regardless and claimed that it was still Head of the River . Jesus and Brasenose men competed over which college 's flag should be hoisted to denote the winning boat . One of the Brasenose crew ended the dispute by saying \" Quot homines tot sententiae , different men have different opinions , some like leeks and some like onions \" , referring to the emblem on the Jesus oars , and it was agreed to row the race again . The Brasenose crew won the rematch . The incident has been said to be shown in an 1822 picture , the earliest depiction of an eights race at Oxford , painted by I. T. Serres ( Marine Painter to George IV ) . However , the print was published on 1 March 1822 and it would have taken several months to prepare and engrave . It also shows a summer scene .

Although Edwards ' expedition almost reached the Sandusky River , they found only deserted villages . Unknown to the volunteers , they narrowly missed being ambushed by the Indians in the area . Many of the men who accompanied Edwards accused him of cowardice .

  "Cibber replied mostly with good humour to Pope 's aspersions ( \" some of which are in conspicuously bad taste \" , as Lowe points out ) , until 1742 when he responded in kind in \" A Letter from Mr. Cibber , to Mr. Pope , inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works , to be so frequently fond of Mr. Cibber 's name \" . In this pamphlet , Cibber 's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope 's Epistle to Arbuthnot ( 1735 ) to Cibber 's \" whore \" , which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel . \" I must own \" , wrote Cibber , \" that I believe I know more of your whoring than you do of mine ; because I don 't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours , though I have been very near an Eye @-@ Witness of Yours . \" Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young , Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous , and he speaks mockingly of the \" little @-@ tiny manhood \" of Pope .

  "The type species of Amphicoelias , A. altus , was named by paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope in December 1877 ( though not published until 1878 ) for an incomplete skeleton consisting of two vertebrae , a pubis ( hip bone ) , and a femur ( upper leg bone ) . Cope also named a second species , A. fragillimus , in the same paper . However , all subsequent researchers have considered A. fragillimus to be a synonym of A. altus . Even by 1881 however , it was recognized that A. altus could not be distinguished from other genera , as the features described by Cope were misinterpreted and are widespread . In 1921 , Osborn and Mook assigned additional bones to A. altus — a scapula ( shoulder blade ) , a coracoid ( shoulder bone ) , an ulna ( lower arm bone ) , and a tooth . Henry Fairfield Osborn and Charles Craig Mook noted the overall close similarity between Amphicoelias and Diplodocus , as well as a few key differences , such as proportionally longer forelimbs in Amphicoelias than in Diplodocus . The dentition of Amphicoelias is homodont . Its teeth are shaped like long slender cylindrical rods , are spaced apart and project forward towards the front of the mouth . The femur of Amphicoelias is unusually long , slender , and round in cross section ; while this roundness was once thought to be another distinguishing characteristic of Amphicoelias , it has since been found in some specimens of Diplodocus as well . A. altus was also similar in size to Diplodocus , estimated to be about 25 m ( 82 ft ) long . While most scientists have used these details to distinguish Amphicoelias and Diplodocus as separate genera , at least one has suggested that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus .",

Both documents were admitted as genuine , and as freeing the abbey from ecclesiastical oversight , as Henry II had at his coronation confirmed all his grandfather 's charters .

Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom , but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010 . Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury , and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately . These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson , who represented Nancy ; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and spend the rest of his life in prison . Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty , saying that he should only speak about his own client , Nancy . Tapson said he found out about Gellman 's plans only late on April 6 . Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury . El Dorado , California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos .",

Chaplin 's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker . Simon Louvish writes that the company was his \" training ground \" , and it was here that Chaplin learnt to vary the pace of his comedy . The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno , who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin 's gags . From the film industry , Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder , whose films he greatly admired . In developing the Tramp costume and persona , he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene , where tramp characters were common .",

  "This is a relatively peaceful event , nothing akin to a supernova , which the Sun is too small to undergo as part of its evolution . Any observer present to witness this occurrence would see a massive increase in the speed of the solar wind , but not enough to destroy a planet completely . However , the star 's loss of mass could send the orbits of the surviving planets into chaos , causing some to collide , others to be ejected from the Solar System , and still others to be torn apart by tidal interactions . Afterwards , all that will remain of the Sun is a white dwarf , an extraordinarily dense object , 54 % its original mass but only the size of the Earth . Initially , this white dwarf may be 100 times as luminous as the Sun is now . It will consist entirely of degenerate carbon and oxygen , but will never reach temperatures hot enough to fuse these elements . Thus the white dwarf Sun will gradually cool , growing dimmer and dimmer .",

The song was written and produced by Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri for the 2009 film Hannah Montana : The Movie . According to the film , when main character Miley Stewart ( played by Miley Cyrus ) was young , her father Robby Ray Stewart ( played by Billy Ray Cyrus ) , would often tell her that while a caterpillar may not be able to move much , it can still dream about the butterfly it will one day be .

  "In a biographical sketch written in 2004 , the historian Jeffrey Richards characterises Reed 's work as a mixing of the earlier school story traditions established by Dean Farrar and Thomas Hughes , crafted with a vivid readability . Reed dismissed Farrar 's Eric , or , Little by Little as a religious tract thinly disguised as a school story , and sought to produce something more \" manly \" . Many of the incidents and characterisations introduced by Reed in St. Dominic 's became standard elements in his subsequent stories , and in those of his imitators .

Adult characters are largely stereotypes : a headmaster known as \" the Doctor \" and modelled on Thomas Arnold of Rugby , \" the jabbering French master ( pointed beard and two @-@ tone shoes ) \" , the popular games master , the dry pedant , the generally comic domestic staff .

  "The history of the subject began with the development in the 19th century of wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena associated with the Doppler effect . The effect is named after Christian Doppler , who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842 . The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot in 1845 . Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves , and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars could be attributed to their motion with respect to the Earth . Before this was verified , however , it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star 's temperature , not motion . Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations .",

  "Most religious traditions in the Greco @-@ Roman world centered on a particular city or ethnic group and did not require personal devotion , only public ritual . In contrast , the cult of Isis , like Christianity and some other mystery cults , was made up of people who joined voluntarily , out of their personal commitment to a deity that many of them regarded as superior to all others . Christianity has its own initiation ritual , baptism , and beginning in the fourth century , Christians began to refer to their sacraments , like baptism , with the word mysterion , the Greek term that was also used for a mystery rite . In this case , the word meant that Christians did not discuss their most important rites with non @-@ Christians who might misunderstand or disrespect them . Their rites thus acquired some of the aura of secrecy that surrounded the mystery cults . Furthermore , if Isiac initiates were thought to benefit in the afterlife from Osiris 's death and resurrection , this belief would parallel the Christian belief that the death and resurrection of Jesus make salvation available to those who become Christians .",

  "To summarize and conclude upon this point : Section 3 of the Recovery Act ( 15 USCA 703 ) is without precedent . It supplies no standards for any trade , industry , or activity . It does not undertake to prescribe rules of conduct to be applied to particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure . Instead of prescribing rules of conduct , it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them . For that legislative undertaking , section 3 sets up no standards , aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation , correction , and expansion described in section 1 . In view of the scope of that broad declaration and of the nature of the few restrictions that are imposed , the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes , and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country , is virtually unfettered . We think that the code @-@ making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power .",

Pascou said that the animal looks similar to a sifaka , but had a human @-@ like face , and was \" the size of a seven @-@ year @-@ old girl \" . It had dark fur and a discernible white spot both on the forehead and below the mouth . According to Pascou , it was a shy animal that fled on the ground instead of in the trees . Burney interpreted the old man as saying that it moved in \" a series of leaps \" , but Godfrey later claimed that \" a series of bounds \" was a better translation — a description that would closely match the foot anatomy of monkey lemurs , such as Hadropithecus and Archaeolemur . Pascou could also imitate its call , a long single \" whoop \" , and said that kidoky would come closer and continue calling if he imitated the call correctly . The call Pascou imitated was comparable to that of a short call for an indri , which lives on the other side of Madagascar . When shown a picture of an indri , Pascou said kidoky did not look like that , and that it had a rounder face , more similar to a sifaka . Pascou also speculated that kidoky could stand on two legs and that it was a solitary animal .",

In the fourth century AD , the Zhuangzi became a major source of imagery and terminology for a new form of Daoism known as the \" Highest Clarity \" ( Shangqing 上清 ) school that was popular among the aristocracy of the Jin dynasty ( AD 265 – 420 ) . Highest Clarity Daoism borrowed notable Zhuangzi terms , such as \" perfected man \" ( zhen ren 真人 ) , \" Great Clarity \" ( Tai Qing 太清 ) , and \" fasting the mind \" ( xin zhai 心齋 ) , and though they are used somewhat differently than in the Zhuangzi itself , they still show the important role the Zhuangzi played at the time .",

  "Su Song also created a celestial atlas ( in five separate maps ) , which had the hour circles between the xiu ( lunar mansions ) forming the astronomical meridians , with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection on each side of the equator , and thus , was in accordance to their north polar distances . Furthermore , Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo . This is so because Su Song 's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu ( − 350 degrees ) and the current Polaris ; this was the more accurate calculation ( by 3 degrees ) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width @-@ improved sighting tube . There were many star maps written before Song 's book , but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is , that they represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form .",

  "Around 1611 , Kepler circulated a manuscript of what would eventually be published ( posthumously ) as Somnium [ The Dream ] . Part of the purpose of Somnium was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet , to show the feasibility of a non @-@ geocentric system . The manuscript , which disappeared after changing hands several times , described a fantastic trip to the moon ; it was part allegory , part autobiography , and part treatise on interplanetary travel ( and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction ) . Years later , a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother , as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel . Following her eventual acquittal , Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story — several times longer than the actual text — which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content ( particularly regarding lunar geography ) hidden within the text .",

  "The slope of the production – possibility frontier ( PPF ) at any given point is called the marginal rate of transformation ( MRT ) . The slope defines the rate at which production of one good can be redirected ( by reallocation of productive resources ) into production of the other . It is also called the ( marginal ) \" opportunity cost \" of a commodity , that is , it is the opportunity cost of X in terms of Y at the margin . It measures how much of good Y is given up for one more unit of good X or vice versa . The shape of a PPF is commonly drawn as concave to the origin to represent increasing opportunity cost with increased output of a good . Thus , MRT increases in absolute size as one moves from the top left of the PPF to the bottom right of the PPF .",

  "The belief that witches could cure and cause harm was common among all social groups in early modern Scotland .

When Stewart incorporated chords onto the hi @-@ hat , \" immediately the word popped into [ Nash 's ] head \" ; he went to the vocal booth and started singing . Nash wrote the first two verses and the chorus over Stewart 's skeleton track . They quickly wrote the lyrics , completing the first verse in 60 seconds . They continued into writing , adding the hook while \" [ Stewart ] would put the next chord \" . In a matter of hours , they had recorded a demo of the track . The song was written with American pop singer Britney Spears in mind , whom Stewart had previously worked with on her 2003 single \" Me Against the Music \" . Stewart and Nash thought that Spears , who had \" her personal life ... a little out of control \" at the time , needed a hit as musical comeback . Spears was working on her fifth album , Blackout , so they sent a copy of the demo to Spears ' management . However , Spears did not hear of the song because her label rejected it , claiming they had enough songs for her to record .",
  "After they hatch , the small caterpillars only eat the tissue ( parenchyma ) between the veins of the leaves . They do this to avoid the sticky and toxic latex produced by the plant 's laticifers and transported in the veins . After 3 – 4 days , the caterpillars also eat flowers , fruit , tendrils , petioles and young stems ( as well as continuing to eat leaves ) , defoliating the entire plant . They are particularly fond of the glands at the base of the leaf , near the petiole . They can deal with the chemical defences in the latex , which does not cause the problem of mouthpart coagulation . The caterpillars spin silk from their mouth with an ' ∞ ' motion of the head as they walk , this keeps them from falling from the smooth surface of the leaves . The silk also permits them to climb back to the plant should they fall . Strong rain makes them fall despite the silk . There are four instars , and the caterpillar stage lasts from two months in the warm season to two and a half to three months in the cold season . The caterpillar is whitish @-@ yellow with black spots and red feet and is covered in club @-@ ended black setae .

  "Amid strong resistance , the Australians were made to fight their way through the maze of bunkers , punji stakes and booby traps but they were eventually able to force a Viet Cong regional force company to withdraw as they continued their advance . The area was heavily seeded with trip wires connected to shells and grenades dangling from branches , one of which blew McFarlane and several of his men off their feet . The defenders subsequently withdrew , with 7th Cu Chi Battalion forced north and 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion to the east .

His evocations of birdsong became increasingly sophisticated , and with Le réveil des oiseaux this process reached maturity , the whole piece being built from birdsong : in effect it is a dawn chorus for orchestra . The same can be said for \" Epode \" , the five @-@ minute sixth movement of \" Chronochromie \" , which is scored for eighteen violins , each one playing a different birdsong . Messiaen notated the bird species with the music in the score ( examples 1 and 4 ) . The pieces are not simple transcriptions ; even the works with purely bird @-@ inspired titles , such as Catalogue d 'oiseaux and Fauvette des jardins , are tone poems evoking the landscape , its colours and atmosphere .",
  "Another Green World represents a turning point in Eno 's musical career . While his previous albums contained quirky rock songs , only five of the fourteen tracks on the album have lyrics . Music critic Jim DeRogatis called it an \" ambient / art @-@ pop \" album . According to eMusic 's Richard Gehr , the album 's music veers from the guitar @-@ oriented experimental rock of Eno 's 1974 albums Here Come the Warm Jets and Taking Tiger Mountain ( By Strategy ) to the synth @-@ oriented ambient minimalism of his subsequent work . Its minimalist instrumentals are scattered among more structured art @-@ rock songs . According to AllMusic 's Steve Huey , most of the album has \" paced instrumentals that , while often closer to ambient music than pop , are both melodic and rhythmic \" , and are accompanied by few pop songs , including \" St. Elmo 's Fire \" , \" I 'll Come Running \" , and \" Golden Hours \" . The instrumental tracks explore a new kind of sound that is more quiet and restful , marking the change between Eno 's earlier rock songs and his later instrumental works in which texture and timbre are the most important musical elements .",

  "Hemilepistus reaumuri was illustrated in volume 21 of the Description de l 'Égypte , researched during Napoleon 's campaign in Egypt and Syria of 1798 – 1801 , and dedicated to René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur . The section on Crustacea was begun by Marie Jules César Savigny but finished by Jean Victoire Audouin after Savigny 's health deteriorated . The species was not given a formal scientific name , however , until Henri Milne @-@ Edwards did so in 1840 , calling it Porcellio reaumuri . Although initially placed in the genus Porcellio , it was later moved by G. H. A. Budde @-@ Lund in 1879 to his new subgenus Hemilepistus , which was raised from a subgenus of Porcellio to the rank of genus by Karl Wilhelm Verhoeff in 1930 . Several species names that were previously thought to be synonyms of H. reaumuri have been re @-@ examined , and found to refer to a species in a different family , now known as Porcellio brevicaudatus .",
  "Odex is a Singaporean company that licenses and releases anime for local and regional consumption . The company tracked people it believed to be illegally downloading its releases in Singapore , using the method employed by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) in the United States . Like the RIAA , Odex hired the American tracking company BayTSP to obtain the IP addresses of downloaders from their respective countries and to track them for several months . BayTSP singled out the website AnimeSuki as a major source of the downloads and tracked many of its BitTorrent users . This data was used to apply for subpoenas to compel ISPs to reveal personal information associated with each IP address . In May 2007 , the ISP SingNet consented in writing to release personal information about its customers , before Odex 's first application against the ISP had its hearing . On 13 August , Odex succeeded in its application against StarHub , which , as a result , was required to reveal the identities of about 1 @,@ 000 ISP users . However , it is revealed that Starhub didn 't revealed any user data to Odex as they were reviewing their rights when Odex lost their appeal to Pacific Internet ( PacNet ) . Odex was represented by law firm Rajah & Tann in all its cases against major ISPs , including its application against PacNet .",
  "With the American Revolutionary War beginning , many thought it would be easy to spread the rebellion to the Province of Quebec , which had only been conquered by the British in 1759 , and whose population was seen as resentful of British rule . The American invasion of Quebec began with the arrival at Île aux Noix of the Continental Army under the command of General Philip Schuyler on September 4 , 1775 . Schuyler , who was ill at the time , eventually turned command of the army over the General Richard Montgomery , who ordered the army to besiege Fort Saint @-@ Jean , which they did on September 18 . At this fort , south of Montreal on the Richelieu River , General Guy Carleton had concentrated the few British regulars at his disposal following the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in May .",
  "The History of the Indies is a three @-@ volume work begun in 1527 while Las Casas was in the Convent of Puerto de Plata . It found its final form in 1561 , when he was working in the Colegio de San Gregorio . Originally planned as a six @-@ volume work , each volume describes a decade of the history of the Indies from the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 to 1520 , and most of it is an eye @-@ witness account . It was in the History of the Indies that Las Casas finally regretted his advocacy for African slavery , and included a sincere apology , writing , \" I soon repented and judged myself guilty of ignorance . I came to realize that black slavery was as unjust as Indian slavery ... and I was not sure that my ignorance and good faith would secure me in the eyes of God . \" ( Vol II , p . 257 )"
