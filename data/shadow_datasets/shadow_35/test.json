  "The Snake River was once one of the most important rivers for the spawning of anadromous fish — which are hatched in the headwaters of rivers , live in the ocean for most of their lives , and return to the river to spawn — in the United States . The river supported species including chinook salmon , coho salmon , and sockeye salmon , as well as steelhead , white sturgeon , and Pacific lamprey . It is known that before the construction of dams on the river , there were three major chinook salmon runs in the Snake River ; in the spring , summer and fall , totaling about 120 @,@ 000 fish , and the sockeye salmon run was about 150 @,@ 000 . The historical barrier to fish migration on the Snake River was Shoshone Falls , a waterfall that occurs as the Snake River passes through the Snake River Plain .",

  "The Derfflinger class was a class of three battlecruisers ( German : Schlachtkreuzer ) of the Imperial German Navy . The ships were ordered for the 1912 – 13 Naval Building Program of the German Imperial Navy as a reply to the Royal Navy 's three new Lion @-@ class battlecruisers that had been launched a few years earlier . The preceding Moltke class and the incrementally improved Seydlitz represented the end of the evolution of Germany 's first generation of battlecruisers . The Derfflinger class had considerable improvements , including a larger primary armament , all of which was mounted on the centerline , eliminating the restricted arc of the amidships turret . The ships were also larger than the preceding classes . The Derfflinger class used a similar propulsion system , and as a result of the increased displacement were slightly slower .",

  "When described as a system of symbolic communication , language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts : signs , meanings , and a code connecting signs with their meanings . The study of the process of semiosis , how signs and meanings are combined , used , and interpreted is called semiotics . Signs can be composed of sounds , gestures , letters , or symbols , depending on whether the language is spoken , signed , or written , and they can be combined into complex signs , such as words and phrases .

  "In addition to taxonomic research , collections can provide information relevant to the study of variety of other ornithological questions , including comparative anatomy , ecology , behavior , disease , and conservation . Forensic ornithologists use collections to identify species involved in aircraft bird strikes , imported materials containing bird parts , and birds killed through various human activities , legal and illegal . In addition , collections are used by zooarchaeologists to identify bird bones at prehistoric human sites or species of origin for feathers used in human cultural artifacts . Collections also have been heavily used by artists , particularly for the production of plates for ornithological field guides . The close @-@ up observation and opportunity for manipulation provided by preserved study skins makes them , together with field observations and photography , to be an important basis for painters of field guide plates of birds .

  "Until the end of the 19th century , the only welding process was forge welding , which blacksmiths had used for centuries to join iron and steel by heating and hammering . Arc welding and oxyfuel welding were among the first processes to develop late in the century , and electric resistance welding followed soon after . Welding technology advanced quickly during the early 20th century as the world wars drove the demand for reliable and inexpensive joining methods . Following the wars , several modern welding techniques were developed , including manual methods like SMAW , now one of the most popular welding methods , as well as semi @-@ automatic and automatic processes such as GMAW , SAW , FCAW and ESW . Developments continued with the invention of laser beam welding , electron beam welding , magnetic pulse welding ( MPW ) , and friction stir welding in the latter half of the century .

  "The king must have been impressed by Edington ’ s performance , because in 1344 he made him treasurer of the realm , a position he held for the exceptionally long period of twelve years .

Further research published in 2012 by Robin Cuthbertson and colleagues found the motions required for Weishampel 's model to be unlikely , and favored a model in which movements of the lower jaw produced grinding action . The lower jaw 's joint with the upper jaw would permit anterior – posterior motion along with the usual rotation , and the anterior joint of the two halves of the lower jaw would also permit motion ; in combination , the two halves of the lower jaw could move slightly back and forth as well as rotating slightly along their long axes .

During the war , North was assisted by two British men : Robert Harvey , who had worked for the Peruvian government in the nitrates ( saltpetre ) industry , and John Dawson , a banker . North was able to use Harvey 's knowledge of the nitrates business and credit provided by Dawson to purchase nitrates bond certificates at low prices from investors who were panicked by Peru 's poor military performance during the war . After the war , the Chilean government annexed Tarapacá and allowed the bond holders to take possession of the title deeds to the nitrate fields , perhaps influenced by appeals from North 's friends . North thus managed to secure a large share of the Chilean nitrate industry for a very small initial investment in almost worthless bonds . The reason that the Chilean government allowed this is that it would have cost them GBP £ 4 million to buy the bonds from the mainly British nitrate speculators . By allowing the speculators to start mining the Chilean government could take a share of profits via export duties without having to provide the initial capital costs to begin production of nitrates .",

  "Patchway railway station first opened on 8 September 1863 when services began on the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway ( BSWUR ) , which ran from Bristol Temple Meads to New Passage Pier , north of Bristol on the banks of the River Severn . At New Passage , passengers were transferred to a ferry to cross the Severn to continue on in to Wales . The line , engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel , was built as single track 7 ft 1 ⁄ 4 in ( 2 @,@ 140 mm ) broad gauge . Patchway was 6 miles 37 chains ( 10 @.@ 4 km ) from Temple Meads , adjacent to the Bristol to Gloucester road , what is now the A38 Gloucester Road .

The BSWUR was amalgamated with the Great Western Railway ( GWR ) , which had from the beginning operated all BSWUR services , in 1868 ; and in 1873 the line was converted to 1 @,@ 435 mm ( 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ) standard gauge . Although the line made travel from Bristol to Wales easier , the change from train to ferry to train was inconvenient , and so a tunnel was built under the Severn . To cope with the anticipated increase in demand , it was decided that the line should be increased to twin track . However , the gradient between Pilning and Patchway , 1 in 68 , was considered undesirably steep for trains heading up the hill towards Bristol , particularly for heavy coal trains , and so a three @-@ mile deviation was built with a 1 in 100 gradient between Pilning and a point south of Patchway . Trains uphill towards Bristol would use the new line , while trains downhill towards Wales would continue to use the steeper , original track . The deviation left the two tracks at Patchway at significantly different levels , and so made the original site impractical for a station . The station was rebuilt 40 chains ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) south along the line at its present site , 5 miles 77 chains ( 9 @.@ 6 km ) from Bristol Temple Meads .

  "So unhappy was Arnold with the conduct of the Gortonites that on 1 September 1651 he wrote to Massachusetts protesting Roger William 's proposed errand to England to seek a charter for the colony . In this letter he spoke in very uncomplimentary terms of the Warwick settlers saying \" under the pretense of liberty of conscience about these parts there came to live all the scum and runaways of the country , which in time for want of better order may bring a heavy burden on the land . \" Over time these sentiments dissipated ; following an appeal to the Massachusetts government , Gorton 's objectionable activities ceased , and he accepted Arnold 's ownership of disputed land .

  "As well , anarchist activists focussed much of their energy towards preparing society for social revolution through education . Anarchists ran schools for children to run counter to the Catholic schools and public schools , believing that religious schools were anathema to their ideas of freedom , and that public schools were too often used to instill ideas of \" patriotic nationalism \" and discourage free thought in children . In issues of ¡ Tierra ! , a weekly anarchist newspaper ( published from 1899 through 1915 , putting out more than 600 issues ) , writers denounced the public school requirement to pay allegiance to the Cuban flag , and encouraged teaching children that the flag was a symbol of \" closed mindedness and divisiveness . \" Anarchists claimed that students enrolled in such schooling would become \" cannon fodder \" for a conflict of Liberal and Conservative Party leaders in 1906 , which caused the US to intervene and occupy Cuba through 1909 . Though anarchists had been running schools since that of the Círculo de Trabajadores , it wasn 't until 1906 that the schools began to take on a less traditional flavor . In 1908 , anarchists included a manifesto in issues of ¡ Tierra ! and La Voz del Dependiente , calling for the establishment of schools modeled after Francesc Ferrer 's Escuela Moderna ( Modern School ) .",
  "A speculative reassessment of Domesday Book ( 1086 ) material suggests that St Denys ' origins may be earlier . Two manors called Eslaforde ( Sleaford ) were recorded in the Domesday Book , one held by Remigius , Bishop of Lincoln , the other by Ramsey Abbey . The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn , Bardi , and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins , 11 bordars , 6 sokemen , a church and priest , as well as 8 mills , 1 acre of woodland , 320 acres ( 130 ha ) of meadow and 330 acres ( 130 ha ) of marsh . Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the Norman Conquest of England ; in Domesday its fee consisted of 1 carucate , 1 sokeman , 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow . It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey 's manor of Quarrington , where he held two churches . There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington , which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot 's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre . The local historians David Roffe and Christine Mahany ruled out the possibility that this referred to Cranwell , another of the abbey 's fees , and concluded that it is probably a reference to the church at Old Sleaford , which was granted by a knight of Ramsey to Haverholme Priory in c . 1165 . Hence , the church possessed by the bishop in the other manor must have been a second church in Sleaford , and therefore could only have been St Denys ' in what would become New Sleaford .",

  "Another combat timing mechanic featured in the game is the \" Charge Meter \" , which allows players to increase the power of spells or attacks by spending additional time preparing them . This meter is always used for spell casting , as well as when using the \" Charge Attack \" skill used by the \" Monk \" class . Although players can choose to act immediately , an ability will become more powerful the longer that the player charges the attack . However , the greater the amount of time one charges attacks , the longer the charging character must wait before the next turn . As a result of this , players can choose to charge up an ability so that the ability triggers shortly before an enemy acts , or can instead aim for the \" sweet spot \" , a special red area on the charging bar , indicating a charge that allows for less time until the next attack , as well as a smaller mana cost . Overall , deciding on the correct amount of charge and letting go of the button at precisely that time can greatly influence the effectiveness of each character 's attacks during combat .",

  "Zebra mussel infestations in the Mississippi River , Great Lakes and other Midwest rivers are also negatively affecting American paddlefish populations . Zebra mussels are an invasive species well adapted for explosive population growth as a result of high rates of fecundity and recruitment . As filter feeders , zebra mussels rely on plankton and can filter significant amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton from the water , altering the availability of an important food source for paddlefish and native unionidae . A few days after the fertilization of zebra mussel eggs , a microscopic larva emerges called a veliger . During this initial stage of development , which usually lasts a few weeks , veligers are able to swim freely in the water column with other microscopic animals comprising zooplankton . Veligers are poor swimmers , making them susceptible to predation by any animal that feeds on zooplankton . However , natural predation of zebra mussels at any stage of development has not made a significant contribution to the long @-@ term reduction of zebra mussel populations .",

Ports 2 and 3 are in phase with each other , hence this is an example of a 0 ° hybrid . Figure 12 shows a planar implementation but this design can also be implemented in coax or waveguide . It is possible to produce a coupler with a coupling factor different from 3 dB by making each λ / 4 section of the ring alternately low and high impedance but for a 3 dB coupler the entire ring is made <formula> of the port impedances – for a 50 Ω design the ring would be approximately 70 Ω .",

  "The Ulm Campaign is considered to be one of the greatest historical examples of a strategic turning movement . Historians often analyze the campaign on a wide strategic level that does not include tactical confrontations , even though these were common and relevant . The decisive victory at Ulm is also believed to be a product of the long training and preparation the Grande Armée received at the camps of Boulogne . The Grande Armée carried little baggage , invaded enemy territory at harvest time , and marched far faster than the Austrians had expected . The campaign highlighted the utility of the Corps d 'Armée system ; corps went on to become the fundamental strategic building block for the major wars in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . A typical corps might have three infantry divisions , a light cavalry brigade for reconnaissance , and reserve artillery batteries in addition to those attached to each division ; their increased size allowed them to fight without support for long periods of time , as Ney did , and their durability permitted them to spread out and subsist by requisitioning local food . The French needed about one eighth the transport used by contemporary armies , giving them a level of mobility and flexibility unseen at that time : invasions of South Germany by Marlborough or Moreau covered a narrow front , but the Grande Armée invaded in 1805 on a front that was 100 miles ( 161 km ) wide , an action that took the Austrians by complete surprise and caused them to underestimate the gravity of the situation .",

  "The Disasters of War ( Spanish : Los desastres de la guerra ) are a series of 82 prints created between 1810 and 1820 by the Spanish painter and printmaker Francisco Goya ( 1746 – 1828 ) . Although Goya did not make known his intention when creating the plates , art historians view them as a visual protest against the violence of the 1808 Dos de Mayo Uprising , the subsequent Peninsular War of 1808 – 14 and the setbacks to the liberal cause following the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy in 1814 . During the conflicts between Napoleon 's French Empire and Spain , Goya retained his position as first court painter to the Spanish crown and continued to produce portraits of the Spanish and French rulers . Although deeply affected by the war , he kept private his thoughts on the art he produced in response to the conflict and its aftermath . He was in poor health and almost deaf when , at 62 , he began work on the prints . They were not published until 1863 , 35 years after his death . It is likely that only then was it considered politically safe to distribute a sequence of artworks criticising both the French and restored Bourbons . In total over a thousand sets have been printed , though later ones are of lower quality , and most print room collections have at least some of the set .",

  "During Grant 's presidency the early Women 's suffrage movement led by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton gained national attention . Anthony lobbied for female suffrage , equal gender pay , and protection of property for women who resided in Washington D.C. In April 1869 , Grant signed into law the protection of married women 's property from their husbands ' debts and the ability for women to sue in court in Washington D.C. In March 1870 Representative Samuel M. Arnell introduced a bill , coauthored by suffragist Bennette Lockwood , that would give women federal workers equal pay for equal work . Two years later Grant signed a modified Senate version of the Arnell Bill into law . The law required that all federal female clerks would be paid the fully compensated salary , however , lower tiered female clerks were exempted . The law increased women 's clerk salaries from 4 % to 20 % during the 1870s , however , the culture of patronage and patriarchy continued .

  "Taube 's interest in coordination chemistry was sparked when he was chosen to develop a course on advanced inorganic chemistry while at the University of Chicago . He was unable to find much information in the textbooks available at the time . Taube realized that his work on the substitution of carbon in organic reactions could be related to inorganic complexes . In 1952 , Taube published a key paper relating the rates of chemical reactions to electronic structure in Chemical Reviews . This research was the first to recognize the correlation between the rate of ligand substitution and the d @-@ electron configuration of the metal . Taube 's key discovery was the way molecules build a type of \" chemical bridge \" rather than simply exchanging electrons , as previously thought . Identifying this intermediate step explained why reactions between similar metals and ions occurred at different rates . His paper in Chemical Reviews was developed while on sabbatical in the late 1940s . An article in Science called this paper \" one of the true classics in inorganic chemistry \" after his Nobel Prize was announced . Taube researched ruthenium and osmium , both elements have a high capacity for back bonding . This type of electron donation was key when studying the way electrons are transferred between molecules in a chemical reaction .",

  "The plan was similar to the failed operation of three weeks previously . Weather dependent , under cover of a smoke screen , aerial bombardment and offshore artillery , the blockships would steam directly into the channel , turn sideways and scuttle themselves . Their advance would be covered by artillery fire against German shore positions from the heavy monitors at distance and at closer range by gunfire from the destroyers . This cover was vital because Ostend was protected by a very strong 11 in ( 280 mm ) gun position known as the Tirpitz battery , named for the admiral . Once the operation had been concluded , the motor launches would draw along the seaward side of the blockships , remove the surviving crews and take them to the monitors for passage back to Britain . This operation was to thoroughly block the channel , and — coupled with the blockage at Zeebrugge ( which the British authorities believed to be fully closed ) — was to prevent use of Bruges by German raiding craft for months to come .",

  "In discussing contextual cues to vowel identifications in English , Rosner & Pickering ( 1994 ) note that controlling for dialect is largely unimportant for eliciting identifications when vowels are placed between consonants , possibly because the / CVC / structure often forms lexical items that can aid in identification ; identifying vowels in isolation , which don 't often carry such lexical information , must be matched to the listener 's set of vowel prototypes with less deviation than in consonantal contexts . In the first chapter of Trudgill ( 1983 ) , Peter Trudgill makes the case that these semantic contexts form the basis of intelligibility across varieties and that the process is irregular and ad hoc rather than the result of any sort of rule @-@ governed passive polylectal competence .",

If damage to the hippocampus occurs in only one hemisphere , leaving the structure intact in the other hemisphere , the brain can retain near @-@ normal memory functioning .

This retention of older memories leads to the idea that consolidation over time involves the transfer of memories out of the hippocampus to other parts of the brain .",

  "Tales of Rebirth was developed by Team Destiny , a section of Namco Tales Studio devoted to 2D Tales titles . It began production in 2003 . The development team , led by series producer Makoto Yoshizumi , was the same team behind Tales of Destiny 2 . Much of the technology from Destiny 2 was carried over to Rebirth . Mutsumi Inomata , a noted anime artist who had previously worked on Tales of Destiny , returned to design the main characters for Rebirth . She worked closely with Yoshizumi to create the designs , with each being representative of the characters ' backgrounds and experiences : for instance , Veigue 's clothing was made navy blue to emphasize his unsociable demeanor . Her Gajuma designs started with a basic human sketch , which was then embellished with animal features and faces . The majority of Rebirth 's story and script was written by Hiramatsu Masaki . The main theme was the issue of coexistence between different races , with the representation of the theme being the conflict between Huma and Gajuma . The Gajuma were created to heighten the sense of contrast for players . The game 's title \" Rebirth \" , was meant to represent the rebirth and reconstruction of harmonious relations between different peoples . Ethnic conflict , another prominent theme , was inspired by the predominant ethnic conflicts in Yugoslavia at the time the game was being made . Prior to the main script writing stage , Yoshizumi conceived the basic set @-@ up and story for the game . The final script ended up being substantially larger than that of Symphonia , covering four full script books .

  "The earliest extant depictions come from 13th century Anatolian Seljuk and Ilkhanid Persian miniatures , typically in literary genres describing the life and deeds of Muhammad . During the Ilkhanid period , when Persia 's Mongol rulers converted to Islam , competing Sunni and Shi 'a groups used visual imagery , including images of Muhammad , to promote their particular interpretation of Islam 's key events . Influenced by the Buddhist tradition of representational religious art predating the Mongol elite 's conversion , this innovation was unprecedented in the Islamic world , and accompanied by a \" broader shift in Islamic artistic culture away from abstraction toward representation \" in \" mosques , on tapestries , silks , ceramics , and in glass and metalwork \" besides books . In the Persian lands , this tradition of realistic depictions lasted through the Timurid dynasty until the Safavids took power in the early 16th century . The Safavaids , who made Shi 'i Islam the state religion , initiated a departure from the traditional Ilkhanid and Timurid artistic style by covering Muhammad 's face with a veil to obscure his features and at the same time represent his luminous essence . Concomitantly , some of the unveiled images from earlier periods were defaced . Later images were produced in Ottoman Turkey and elsewhere , but mosques were never decorated with images of Muhammad . Illustrated accounts of the night journey ( mi 'raj ) were particularly popular from the Ilkhanid period through the Safavid era . During the 19th century , Iran saw a boom of printed and illustrated mi 'raj books , with Muhammad 's face veiled , aimed in particular at illiterates and children in the manner of graphic novels . Reproduced through lithography , these were essentially \" printed manuscripts \" . Today , millions of historical reproductions and modern images are available in some Muslim countries , especially Turkey and Iran , on posters , postcards , and even in coffee @-@ table books , but are unknown in most other parts of the Islamic world , and when encountered by Muslims from other countries , they can cause considerable consternation and offense .",

  "The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of the mining town of Frank , Alberta , Canada . The province of Alberta was not created until September 1905 , more than two years after the slide . The community was still part of the Northwest Territories when the incident occurred at 4 : 10 am on April 29 , 1903 . Over 82 million tonnes ( 90 million tons ) of limestone rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds , obliterating the eastern edge of Frank , the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine . It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest , as between 70 and 90 of the town 's residents were killed , most of whom remain buried in the rubble . Multiple factors led to the slide : Turtle Mountain 's formation left it in a constant state of instability . Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain 's internal structure , as did a wet winter and cold snap on the night of the disaster .",

  "Within minutes of the British attack , Ceylon surrendered and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her . The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore , joined shortly afterwards by Minerve , Bellone and later by Victor , so that by 18 : 30 the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire . Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position , and at 19 : 00 a cannon shot cut Nereide 's stern anchor cable . The British frigate swung around , presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron .

At 20 : 00 , Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide ; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone , placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve . Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore , Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire . He also had the rail removed between the foredeck and the quarterdeck of Minerve , and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns , thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery . By 22 : 00 Nereide was a wreck , receiving shot from several sides , with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200 : the first lieutenant was dying , the second was severely wounded and Willoughby 's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter .

Jardine , concerned by his poor run of batting form , had promoted himself to open the batting but was part of a drastic England collapse to 30 for four in the first innings . However , the trouble began when Bill Woodfull was struck on the chest by a Larwood delivery , drawing the comment from Jardine of \" Well bowled , Harold \" , aimed mainly at Bradman who was also batting at the time .

  "Three major challenges face the design of disruptively patterned uniforms , however . Firstly , units frequently move from one terrain to another , where the background colours and contrasts may differ greatly . A uniform designed for woodland will be too strongly contrasting for desert use , and too green for urban use . Therefore , no single camouflage pattern is effective in all terrains . The American UCP of 2004 attempted to suit all environments but was withdrawn after a few years of service . Terrain specific patterns like \" Berlin camouflage \" , which was applied to British vehicles operating in Berlin during the Cold War , have sometimes been developed but are ineffective in other terrains . Secondly , the effectiveness of any pattern in disrupting a soldier 's outlines varies with lighting , depending on the weather and the height of the sun in the sky . And thirdly , any given patch of printed colour varies in apparent size with distance from the enemy observing the pattern . A pattern printed with small patches of colour blends into a single perceived mass at a certain range , defeating the disruptive effect . Conversely , a pattern printed with large patches of colour appears conspicuous at shorter ranges . This problem has been solved with pixellated shapes , often designed digitally , that provide a fractal @-@ like range of patch sizes , enabling them to be effectively disruptive both at close range and at a distance . The first genuinely digital camouflage pattern was the Canadian CADPAT , soon followed by the American MARPAT . A pixellated appearance is not essential for this effect , though it is simpler to design and to print .",

The Soviet Union was not worried solely about the political implications of reform but about the economic implications as well . Economically , the Soviet Union was heavily invested in Poland . The Soviet Union had financed Polish industry and was Poland 's main trading partner . The Soviet Union directed what products Poland manufactured ; the Soviets bought the products and exported goods to Poland no longer produced within the country itself . The Polish and Soviet economies were thus heavily integrated ; any reform , whether political or economic , in one of the countries would inevitably have a great impact on the other . Because Poland was inextricably connected to the Soviet Union economically , the thought of an independent Polish economy was unrealistic . The country had been forced to rely on the Soviets for such a long time that breaking away completely would prove disastrous . Thus , both countries held crucial power in different facets . Poland could threaten Soviet strength and power in Eastern Europe politically , and the Soviet Union could essentially destroy the Polish economy . Therefore , any reform in the Polish government would have to concede to some Soviet demands , while the Soviets concurrently would have to concede to a vital partner .",
  "The history of botanical gardens is closely linked to the history of botany itself . The botanical gardens of the 16th and 17th centuries were medicinal gardens , but the idea of a botanical garden changed to encompass displays of the beautiful , strange , new and sometimes economically important plant trophies being returned from the European colonies and other distant lands . Later , in the 18th century , they became more educational in function , demonstrating the latest plant classification systems devised by botanists working in the associated herbaria as they tried to order these new treasures . Then , in the 19th and 20th centuries , the trend was towards a combination of specialist and eclectic collections demonstrating many aspects of both horticulture and botany .",

  "Durkheim 's monograph , Suicide ( 1897 ) is considered a seminal work in statistical analysis by contemporary sociologists . Suicide is a case study of variations in suicide rates among Catholic and Protestant populations , and served to distinguish sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy . It also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of structural functionalism . By carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts , he attempted to demonstrate that Catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of Protestants , something he attributed to social ( as opposed to individual or psychological ) causes . He developed the notion of objective sui generis \" social facts \" to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study . Through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is ' healthy ' or ' pathological ' , and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or \" social anomie \" .",

  "In 1963 , Sydney Brenner proposed using C. elegans as a model organism for the investigation primarily of neural development in animals . It is one of the simplest organisms with a nervous system . In the hermaphrodite , this system comprises 302 neurons the pattern of which has been comprehensively mapped , in what is known as a connectome , and shown to be a small @-@ world network . Research has explored the neural and molecular mechanisms that control several behaviors of C. elegans , including chemotaxis , thermotaxis , mechanotransduction , learning , memory , and mating behaviour . Brenner also chose it as it is easy to grow in bulk populations , and convenient for genetic analysis . It is a multicellular eukaryotic organism , yet is simple enough to be studied in great detail . The transparency of C. elegans facilitates the study of cellular differentiation and other developmental processes in the intact organism . The spicules in the male clearly distinguish males from females . Strains are cheap to breed and can be frozen . When subsequently thawed , they remain viable , allowing long @-@ term storage .",

  "Lemurs are primates belonging to the suborder Strepsirrhini . Like other strepsirrhine primates , such as lorises , pottos , and galagos , they share ancestral ( or plesiomorphic ) traits with early primates . In this regard , lemurs are popularly confused with ancestral primates ; however , lemurs did not give rise to monkeys and apes ( simians ) . Instead , they evolved independently in isolation on Madagascar . All modern strepsirrhines including lemurs are traditionally thought to have evolved from early primates known as adapiforms during the Eocene ( 56 to 34 mya ) or Paleocene ( 66 to 56 mya ) . Adapiforms , however , lack a specialized arrangement of teeth , known as a toothcomb , which nearly all living strepsirrhines possess . A more recent hypothesis is that lemurs descended from lorisoids ( loris @-@ like ) primates . This is supported by comparative studies of the cytochrome b gene and the presence of the strepsirrhine toothcomb in both groups . Instead of being the direct ancestors of lemurs , the adapiforms may have given rise to both the lemurs and lorisoids , a split that would be supported by molecular phylogenetic studies . The later split between lemurs and lorises is thought to have occurred approximately 62 to 65 mya according to molecular studies , although other genetic tests and the fossil record in Africa suggest more conservative estimates of 50 to 55 mya for this divergence . However , the oldest lemur fossils on Madagascar are actually subfossils dating to the Late Pleistocene .",

  "Royal forests in the early medieval period were subject to special royal jurisdiction ; forest law was \" harsh and arbitrary , a matter purely for the King 's will \" . Forests were expected to supply the king with hunting grounds , raw materials , goods and money . The Forest of Dean could be used for hunting , but was more important to the king as a major metalworking centre , thanks to the plentiful supply of trees for making charcoal and the iron deposits in the limestone stone of the region . The iron goods constructed locally were stored at the castle before being shipped to other royal locations .

  "In the 1973 film The Exorcist , a tape of noises from the possessed victim was discovered to contain a message when the tape was played backwards . This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects . Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly classic rock songs , whose authors denied any intent to promote Satanism , backmasking has been used by heavy metal bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery . Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons . For example , thrash metal band Slayer included at the start of the band 's 1985 album Hell Awaits a deep backmasked voice chanting \" Join Us \" over and over . ( listen ) . However , Slayer vocalist Tom Araya states that the band 's use of Satanic imagery was \" solely for effect \" .

  "The closed @-@ shell electron configuration of flerovium results in the metallic bonding in metallic flerovium being weaker than in the preceding and following elements ; thus , flerovium is expected to have a low boiling point , and has recently been suggested to be possibly a gaseous metal . The melting and boiling points of flerovium are predicted to be around 70 ° C and 150 ° C , significantly lower than the values for the lighter group 14 elements ( those of lead are 327 ° C and 1749 ° C respectively ) , and continuing the trend of decreasing boiling points down the group . Although earlier studies predicted a boiling point of ~ 1000 ° C or 2840 ° C , this is now considered unlikely because of the expected weak metallic bonding in flerovium and that group trends would expect flerovium to have a low sublimation enthalpy . In the solid state , flerovium is expected to be a dense metal due to its high atomic weight , with a density variously predicted to be either 22 g · cm − 3 or 14 g · cm − 3 .

  "Later , Brown revised the phylogeny of Corythosaurus , and found that it was closely related , and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus . The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae , and the proportions of the limbs . During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s , Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately , and that birds , based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians . He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true . He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians , it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus . However , even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians , birds are now thought to have descended from the latter .",

  "Fossils of the extinct red panda Parailurus anglicus have been unearthed from China in the east to Britain in the west . In 1977 , a single tooth of Parailurus was discovered in the Pliocene Ringold Formation of Washington . This first North American record is almost identical to European specimens and indicates the immigration of this species from Asia . In 2004 , a tooth from a red panda species never before recorded in North America was discovered at the Gray Fossil Site in Tennessee . The tooth dates from 4 @.@ 5 – 7 million years ago . This species , described as Pristinailurus bristoli , indicates that a second , more primitive ailurine lineage inhabited North America during the Miocene .

The frequency with which panda fossils are being found at Gray Fossil Site suggests the species played a large role in the overall ecosystem of the area .",

  "A classical spring system can be described in terms of vibrational modes , which are analogous to the harmonics that occur on a stretched violin string . If the system starts in a particular mode , vibrations in other modes do not develop . With the nonlinear component , Fermi expected energy in one mode to transfer gradually to other modes , and eventually , to be distributed equally among all modes . This is roughly what began to happen shortly after the system was initialized with all its energy in the lowest mode , but much later , essentially all the energy periodically reappeared in the lowest mode . This behavior is very different from the expected equipartition of energy . It remained mysterious until 1965 , when Kruskal and Zabusky showed that , after appropriate mathematical transformations , the system can be described by the Korteweg – de Vries equation , which is the prototype of nonlinear partial differential equations that have soliton solutions . This means that FPU behavior can be understood in terms of solitons .",

  "Greater scaup breed in the tundra and the boreal forest ; it is estimated that 75 % of the North American population breed in Alaska . They typically nest on islands in large northern lakes . Greater scaup begin breeding when they are two years old , although they may start nesting at age one . Drake greater scaup have a soft , quick whistle they use to attract the attention of hens during courtship , which takes place from late winter to early spring , on the way back to their northern breeding grounds . Female greater scaup have a single pitch , a raspy “ arrr @-@ arrr @-@ arrr @-@ arrr @-@ arrr ” vocalization . The courtship is complex and results in the formation of monogamous pairs . Pairs nest in close proximity to each other in large colonies , usually near water , on an island or shoreline , or on a raft of floating vegetation . The nest consists of a shallow depression made by the female and lined with her down . After the female lays the eggs , the drake abandons the female and goes with other drakes to a large , isolated lake to molt . These lakes can be close to the breeding grounds or miles away . The lakes chosen are used yearly by the same ducks . The optimal molting lake is fairly shallow and has an abundance of food sources and cover . The female lays six to nine olive @-@ buff @-@ colored eggs , which she incubates for 24 – 28 days . A larger clutch could indicate brood parasitism by other greater scaups or even ducks of other species . Newly hatched chicks are covered with down and are soon able to walk , swim , and feed themselves ; however , they are not able to fly until 40 – 45 days after hatching . The vulnerable small chicks follow their mother , who protects them from predators .",

She had reached another turning point in her career , reinventing herself and her image with the public . \" Her relationship with Carlos Leon ended in May 1997 ; she declared that they were \" better off as best friends . \" After Lourdes 's birth , Madonna became involved in Eastern mysticism and Kabbalah .

  "The incremental effect of gravitational perturbations between the planets causes the inner Solar System as a whole to behave chaotically over long time periods .

Australia needed 404 to win on a pitch favouring spin , but the poor performances of the main bowlers allowed Australia to record a seven wicket win described by Wisden as \" astonishing \" . Hutton 's contribution to the second Australian innings was to bowl four overs and concede 30 runs . Australia 's dominance in the series was sealed by a crushing win in the fifth Test . England were bowled out for 52 runs in the first innings , of which Hutton scored 30 before being last out to an exceptional catch down the leg side from wicketkeeper Don Tallon . Wisden described Hutton as \" the one exception to complete failure \" , while other critics noted he always looked comfortable .

  "COPD develops as a significant and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants . Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state . The inflammatory cells involved include neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages , two types of white blood cell . Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement similar to that in asthma . Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors . Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells , and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors . The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema , which then contributes to the poor airflow and , finally , poor absorption and release of respiratory gases . General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood .",

  "This is also called the virus @-@ first hypothesis and proposes that viruses may have evolved from complex molecules of protein and nucleic acid at the same time as cells first appeared on Earth and would have been dependent on cellular life for billions of years . Viroids are molecules of RNA that are not classified as viruses because they lack a protein coat . However , they have characteristics that are common to several viruses and are often called subviral agents . Viroids are important pathogens of plants . They do not code for proteins but interact with the host cell and use the host machinery for their replication . The hepatitis delta virus of humans has an RNA genome similar to viroids but has a protein coat derived from hepatitis B virus and cannot produce one of its own . It is , therefore , a defective virus . Although hepatitis delta virus genome may replicate independently once inside a host cell , it requires the help of hepatitis B virus to provide a protein coat so that it can be transmitted to new cells . In similar manner , the sputnik virophage is dependent on mimivirus , which infects the protozoan Acanthamoeba castellanii . These viruses , which are dependent on the presence of other virus species in the host cell , are called satellites and may represent evolutionary intermediates of viroids and viruses .",

  "Critics have offered many readings of the influence of weird and horror fiction on True Detective 's narrative , specifically Robert W. Chambers ' short story collection The King in Yellow ( 1895 ) and Thomas Ligotti , as well as nihilism and pessimism . Allusions to The King in Yellow can be observed through the show 's dark underbelly , its recurring use of \" Carcosa \" and \" The Yellow King \" as motifs throughout the series , and its symbolic use of yellow as a thematic signature that signifies insanity , decadence , and mental illness . The similarities between Ligotti 's work and True Detective became the center of a plagiarism scandal , in which Pizzolatto was accused of plagiarizing texts from The Conspiracy Against the Human Race ( 2010 ) .

  "Trillium grandiflorum has long been thought to self @-@ pollinate based on the fact that pollinators had rarely been observed visiting the plants and because there is low variation in chromosomal banding patterns . This has been strongly challenged , as other studies have shown high pollination rates by bumblebees and very low success of self @-@ pollination in controlled experiments , implying that they are in fact self @-@ incompatible . Several ovules of a given individual often fail to produce seeds . One contributing factor is pollen limitation , and one study showed that open pollinated plants had 56 % of their ovules produce seeds , while in hand pollinated individuals the figure was 66 % . Plants with reduced exposure to pollinators were 33 % to 50 % less likely to produce fruits than those that were , while hand pollinated individuals showed a 100 % fruit set ( though these fruits did not contain a 100 % seed set ) . Plant resources were shown to be a limiting factor in seed production : when pollen was in abundance , larger plants had a significantly greater seed to ovule ratio than smaller ones . The overall suboptimal seed to ovule ratios suggest that Trillium grandiflorum has evolved to maximize reproductive success in the face of highly stochastic pollination , where some plants may only be visited by a single pollinator in a season .",

  "Southern Cross 's first port of call on the Ross Sea voyage was Possession Island , where the tin box left by Borchgrevink and Bull in 1895 was recovered . They then proceeded southwards , following the Victoria Land coast and discovering further islands , one of which Borchgrevink named after Sir Clements Markham , whose hostility towards the expedition was evidently unchanged by this honour . Southern Cross then sailed on to Ross Island , observed the volcano Mount Erebus , and attempted a landing at Cape Crozier , at the foot of Mount Terror . Here , Borchgrevink and Captain Jensen were almost drowned by a large wave caused by a calving or breakaway of ice from the adjacent Great Ice Barrier . Following the path of James Clark Ross sixty years previously , they proceeded eastwards along the Barrier edge , to find the inlet where , in 1843 , Ross had reached his farthest south . Observations indicated that the Barrier edge had moved some 30 statute miles ( 50 km ) south since Ross 's time , which meant that the ship were already south of Ross 's record . Borchgrevink was determined to make a landing on the Barrier itself , and in the vicinity of Ross 's inlet he found a spot where the ice sloped sufficiently to suggest that a landing was possible . On 16 February he , Colbeck and Savio landed with dogs and a sledge , ascended to the Barrier surface , and then journeyed a few miles south to a point which they calculated as 78 ° 50 ′ S , a new Farthest South record . They were the first persons to travel on the Barrier surface , earning Amundsen 's approbation : \" We must acknowledge that , by ascending the Barrier , Borchgrevink opened the way to the south , and threw aside the greatest obstacle to the expeditions that followed \" . Close to the same spot ten years later , Amundsen would establish his base camp \" Framheim \" , prior to his successful South Pole journey .",

A legal battle ensued , eventually settled in August 1943 . On September 3 , 1942 , Dorsey bid farewell to Sinatra , reportedly saying as Sinatra left , \" I hope you fall on your ass \" .

Sinatra persuaded Stordahl to leave Dorsey with him and become his personal arranger , offering him $ 650 a month , five times the salary of Dorsey . Dorsey and Sinatra , who had been very close , never patched up their differences before Dorsey 's death in 1956 , worsened by the fact that Dorsey occasionally made biting comments to the press such as \" he 's the most fascinating man in the world , but don 't put your hand in the cage \" .",

  "Wilhelm Richard Wagner ( / ˈvɑːɡnər / ; German : [ ˈʁiçaʁt ˈvaːɡnɐ ] ; 22 May 1813 – 13 February 1883 ) was a German composer , theatre director , polemicist , and conductor who is primarily known for his operas ( or , as some of his later works were later known , \" music dramas \" ) . Unlike most opera composers , Wagner wrote both the libretto and the music for each of his stage works . Initially establishing his reputation as a composer of works in the romantic vein of Weber and Meyerbeer , Wagner revolutionised opera through his concept of the Gesamtkunstwerk ( \" total work of art \" ) , by which he sought to synthesise the poetic , visual , musical and dramatic arts , with music subsidiary to drama . He described this vision in a series of essays published between 1849 and 1852 . Wagner realised these ideas most fully in the first half of the four @-@ opera cycle Der Ring des Nibelungen ( The Ring of the Nibelung ) .",

  "Many individuals are inspired to join the movement after enjoying German folk tales or Norse myths as children , or after being interested by the depiction of Norse religion in popular culture . Some others claim to have involved themselves in the religion after experiencing direct revelation through dreams , which they interpret as having been provided by the gods . As with other religions , a sensation of \" coming home \" has also been reported by many Heathens who have converted to the faith . Although practitioners typically live within Christian majority societies , they often express the view that Christianity has little to offer them . During her research , Schnurbein found that during the 1980s many Heathens had been motivated to join the religion in part by their own anti @-@ Christian ethos , but that this attitude had become less prominent among the Heathen community as the significance of the Christian churches had declined in Western nations after that point .

The grey @-@ necked rockfowl is monogamous and pairs nest either alone or in the vicinity of other pairs , sometimes in colonies of two to five nests , though one colony of forty nests has been recorded . These nests are constructed out of mud and are formed into a deep cup that is built on rock surfaces , typically in caves or on cliffs . Two eggs are laid twice a year . Though the birds breed in colonies , infanticide exists in this species , with rockfowl attempting to kill the young of other pairs . Nestlings mature in about a month .",

In chapter three , Ramza seeks answers and help first from his estranged family in the Ivalician capital of Lesalia ; there he is rebuked by Zalbaag , though his sister , Alma , believes his tales of deeper corruption and accompanies him . At Orbonne , the pair are surprised to discover the Knights Templar , the military wing of Glabados , sacking and plundering its own monastery . Within , Ramza first confronts Isilud as he makes off with yet another piece of auracite recovered from the bowels of Orbonne 's labyrinthine library . During the debacle another Templar , Wiegraf , converts into a Lucavi and escapes . A dying monk gives Ramza the one thing that can thwart the church 's ambitions to manipulate The War of the Lions : the ancient Scriptures of Germonique , a truthful biography of the life of St. Ajora Glabados . Within the text Ramza discovers the legend of the Zodiac Braves is a falsehood , and Ajora 's supposedly divine nature nothing less than a fabrication . Ramza is shortly thereafter confronted by an agent of Grand Duke Barrington , claiming possession of Alma , whom Isilud had kidnapped upon fleeing Orbonne . Pursuing his sister , Ramza is first beset by Marach and Rapha , mage assassins in the Duke 's employ - Rapha defects to Ramza , and as they travel , Barrington meets with Folmarv , commander of the Templars , presenting his captured son , Isilud , and relaying Glabados ' entire plan , threatening to expose the church and elevate himself to the throne , to which Folmarv merely transforms into a Lucavi and sets about slaughtering the castle 's inhabitants . Ramza arrives after this devastation and defeats the demonic Wiegraf . It is on the castle 's roof that Ramza protects Rapha from the demonically possessed Marquis Elmdore , after Elmdore 's assassins have dispatched Barrington . Afterwards , Rapha appeals to the auracite much as Wiegraf had , though this succeeds in resurrecting her fallen brother rather than manifesting another demon . The three question whether auracite is a gateway to an infernal realm , or merely a window into the human heart .",

  "Essentially , a model is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes . Within any modern model is a set of equations , known as the primitive equations , used to predict the future state of the atmosphere . These equations — along with the ideal gas law — are used to evolve the density , pressure , and potential temperature scalar fields and the velocity vector field of the atmosphere through time . Additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive @-@ equation mesoscale models as well . The equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods , with the exception of a few idealized cases . Therefore , numerical methods obtain approximate solutions . Different models use different solution methods : some global models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and finite difference methods for the vertical dimension , while regional models and other global models usually use finite @-@ difference methods in all three dimensions .",

  "Given that Polistes exclamans nests are often destroyed or suffer through the death of the queen ( most often through natural circumstances ) , it is necessary and adaptive for there to be a specific system for the replacement of the queen . The current system in place can best “ be described as gerontocracy . ” Furthermore , it is also closely related to the dominance system within the colony as well . In the dominance hierarchy , older individuals are higher in rank , whereas younger individuals serve in the lower ranks . These older female workers are generally more aggressive and forage more frequently . In reflection of this dominance ranking and the behavior of the female workers , it is seen that when a queen is no longer present in the colony , the next eldest worker becomes the new queen . This may be due to the genetics of the next eldest queen , as the replacement queen affects the overall relatedness of the females in the brood , thereby allowing the future brood to be more related to the adult workers rearing them .",

  "Shortly after the 1977 Aldeburgh Festival , Imogen became seriously ill with what she described as \" a coronary angina \" . Thereafter , angina was a recurrent problem , although she continued to work and fulfil engagements . By early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends . She died at home of heart failure on 9 March 1984 and was buried in Aldeburgh churchyard five days later in a plot next to Britten 's . An obituary tribute in the magazine Early Music emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church , where she \" [ brought ] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing source of strength and wonder \" .

  "Circa 1875 , the Montauk tribe began renting out Montauk Point for pasturage through the Proprietors ' Company ; the company took possession of the grazing allotments , and paid the tribe an annuity . Circa 1880 , the shareholders of the company disagreed over whether the lands should continue to be leased , or whether they should be re @-@ apportioned . In 1878 , Robert M. Grinnell sued Edward M.

  "After the king 's commission had been read aloud , the crowd were normally asked to move back from the scaffold before being addressed by the convict . While these speeches were mostly an admission of guilt ( although few admitted treason ) , still they were carefully monitored by the sheriff and chaplain , who were occasionally forced to act ; in 1588 , Catholic priest William Dean 's address to the crowd was considered so inappropriate that he was gagged almost to the point of suffocation . Questions on matters of allegiance and politics were sometimes put to the prisoner , as happened to Edmund Gennings in 1591 . He was asked by priest hunter Richard Topcliffe to \" confess his treason \" , but when Gennings responded \" if to say Mass be treason , I confess to have done it and glory in it \" , Topcliffe ordered him to be quiet and instructed the hangman to push him off the ladder . Sometimes the witness responsible for the condemned man 's execution was also present . A government spy , John Munday , was in 1582 present for the execution of Thomas Ford . Munday supported the sheriff , who had reminded the priest of his confession when he protested his innocence . The sentiments expressed in such speeches may be related to the conditions encountered during imprisonment . Many Jesuit priests suffered badly at the hands of their captors but were frequently the most defiant ; conversely , those of a higher station were often the most apologetic . Such contrition may have arisen from the sheer terror felt by those who thought they might be disembowelled rather than simply beheaded as they would normally expect , and any apparent acceptance of their fate may have stemmed from the belief that a serious , but not treasonable act , had been committed . Good behaviour at the gallows may also have been due to a convict 's desire for his heirs not to be disinherited .",
  "Republican president Dwight D.

In the Republican primary , voters chose Thruston B. Morton to challenge Clements . With two of his factional enemies as candidates for the Senate , Governor Chandler bolted the party and supported the Republican candidates . Further complicating Clements ' campaign was the fact that Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson suffered a heart attack in 1956 , and as majority whip , Clements had to spend much of his time in Washington , D.C. covering Johnson 's duties in the Senate . What time he was in Kentucky was usually devoted to Wetherby 's campaign , since the Democrats believed Clements would be re @-@ elected easily while Wetherby faced much stiffer odds .

  "Fisher has observed that Puccini 's was a tragic muse ; in the second act of Tosca , according to Newman , he rises to his greatest height as a master of the musical macabre . The act begins quietly , with Scarpia musing on the forthcoming downfall of Angelotti and Cavaradossi , while in the background a gavotte is played in a distant quarter of the Farnese Palace . For this music Puccini adapted a fifteen @-@ year @-@ old student exercise by his late brother , Michele , stating that in this way his brother could live again through him .

  "Robert was Lord Chancellor from spring 1140 to summer 1154 , serving King Stephen of England . It is not known exactly when Stephen appointed Robert chancellor nor why Stephen choose him for the office . The historian Richard Sherman speculated that Stephen appointed Robert as a favour to Walter de Gant , perhaps because of Walter 's at the Battle of Cowton Moor in 1138 . Three charters which date from March 1140 to January 1141 and are supposed to be witnessed by Robert all have difficulties with either the dating or whether the signature attributed to Robert is actually Robert , so exact dating of his term of office isn 't possible from charter evidence . For a brief period in 1141 , Stephen 's rival Empress Matilda also appointed two chancellors – William de Vere and William FitzGilbert – but they did not interrupt Robert 's term of service . Robert was with Stephen at Caistor during the middle of 1143 , where he was a witness on charters . Throughout his approximately 14 years as chancellor , Robert only witnessed 20 charters certainly and perhaps another 13 that are not securely attributed to Robert . Stephen 's two previous chancellors , Roger le Poer and Philip de Harcourt , had a much higher rate of attesting charters – 62 in 3 @.@ 5 years for Roger and 12 in 9 months for Philip . Various reasons have been put forward for why Robert attested at a lower rate than the earlier chancellors , including indifference to his office , deputising the duties to another clerk , or difficulty in following the itinerant court due to age . Robert 's last secure appearance as chancellor as a witness to a charter is one dated to the summer of 1154 at Lincoln .",

  "The lanthanides and actinides , in the metallic state , can exist as either divalent ( such as europium and ytterbium ) or trivalent ( most other lanthanides ) metals . The former have fn + 1s2 configurations , whereas the latter have fnd1s2 configurations . In 1975 , Johansson and Rosengren examined the measured and predicted values for the cohesive energies ( enthalpies of crystallization ) of the metallic lanthanides and actinides , both as divalent and trivalent metals . The conclusion was that the increased binding energy of the [ Rn ] 5f136d17s2 configuration over the [ Rn ] 5f147s2 configuration for nobelium was not enough to compensate for the energy needed to promote one 5f electron to 6d , as is true also for the very late actinides : thus einsteinium , fermium , mendelevium , and nobelium were expected to be divalent metals , although for nobelium this prediction has not yet been confirmed . The increasing predominance of the divalent state well before the actinide series concludes is attributed to the relativistic stabilization of the 5f electrons , which increases with increasing atomic number : an effect of this is that nobelium is predominantly divalent instead of trivalent , unlike all the other lanthanides and actinides . In 1986 , nobelium metal was estimated to have an enthalpy of sublimation between 126 kJ · mol − 1 , a value close to the values for einsteinium , fermium , and mendelevium and supporting the theory that nobelium would form a divalent metal . Like the other divalent late actinides ( except the once again trivalent lawrencium ) , metallic nobelium should assume a face @-@ centered cubic crystal structure . Divalent nobelium metal should have a metallic radius of around 197 pm .

  "The elliptical building is one of several differences between the fortress at Chester and other Roman fortresses in the province . Deva was 20 % larger , 5 hectares ( 12 acres ) , than the fortresses of Eboracum ( York ) – later capital of Britannia Inferior – and Isca Augusta ( Caerleon ) . Also , the stone curtain wall at Chester was constructed without mortar , using large sandstone blocks ; this required greater skill and effort than the methods used to build the walls of Eboracum and Isca Augusta , and was usually reserved for the most important structures such as temples or city walls rather than town walls . The presence of unusual buildings at the heart of the fortress – accounting for the 4 hectares ( 10 acres ) by which Deva was larger than other fortresses – has been taken as evidence that their construction was specifically ordered by the provincial governor . The governor ( Legatus Augusti pro praetore ) when construction first started was Gnaeus Julius Agricola . Lead piping found in the elliptical building bears his name , the only evidence in Britain of a building under his direct control . These differences suggest that Deva may have been Agricola ’ s administrative headquarters – in effect the capital of Britannia . This was speculated on in a Timewatch investigation .",

  "Although there are no records as to the designs of the early steam engines produced by the Mars Works , Evans 's most famous engine design appeared around 1812 . Called the Columbian Engine as a patriotic gesture , it would prove to be the most advanced and successful steam engine design created by Evans — he brought to bear his now extensive experience in designing and building high @-@ pressure steam engines . This horizontally oriented engine allowed the crankshaft and piston rod to work closely together at one end of the machine , thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines . The piston rod itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar .

  "Homer Jay Simpson , voiced by Dan Castellaneta , is the father of the Simpson family . He embodies several American working class stereotypes : he is crude , overweight , incompetent , clumsy , thoughtless and a borderline alcoholic . He has occasionally displayed flashes of great intellect and fitness whenever the situation calls for it , and an integrity reflecting his own values , including a fierce devotion to and protectiveness of his family . His voice started out as an impression of Walter Matthau but eventually evolved into a more robust voice during the second and third season of the half @-@ hour show , allowing Homer to cover a fuller range of emotions . Homer has since become one of the most influential fictional characters and has been described by the UK newspaper The Sunday Times as the greatest comedic creation of modern time . He has inspired an entire line of merchandise , and his catchphrase , the annoyed grunt \" D 'oh ! \" , has been included in the Oxford English Dictionary .",

  "Sorabji 's counterpoint stems from Busoni 's and Reger 's . The influence of these composers led Sorabji to employ various baroque contrapuntal forms ( chorale prelude , passacaglia , fugue and others ) , but he rejected the symmetry and forms that characterise the music of composers such as Mozart and Brahms . Sorabji was dismissive of the Classical style , mainly because he saw it as restricting the musical material to conform to a \" ready @-@ made mould \" , and his musical thinking is closer to that of the Baroque era than to the Classical .",

He attempted to regulate the cleaning and dyeing process of artisans who did business with him , and shipped wool intended for higher grade weaving outside the region for factory cleaning . He limited the range of dyes in textiles he traded and refused to deal fabric that had included certain commercially produced yarns .

  "Typically diurnal , the jungle cat hunts throughout the day . Solitary in nature , jungle cats do not interact appreciably except in the mating season . The only prominent interaction is the mother @-@ kitten bond . Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking . The cat is primarily a carnivore , and prefers small mammals ( gerbils , hares and rodents ) and birds . It hunts by stalking its prey , followed by a sprint or a leap ; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey . Both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are a year old ; females enter oestrus from January to March . Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat ; the male pursues the female in oestrus , seizes her by the nape of her neck and mounts her . Gestation lasts nearly two months . Births take place between December and June , though this might vary geographically . Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months .",

  "Cædwalla was unbaptised when he came to the throne of Wessex , and remained so throughout his reign , but though he is often referred to as a pagan this is not necessarily the most apt description ; it may be that he was already Christian in his beliefs but delayed his baptism to a time of his choice . He was clearly respectful of the church , with charter evidence showing multiple grants to churches and for religious buildings . When Cædwalla first attacked the South Saxons , Wilfrid was at the court of King Æthelwealh , and on Æthelwealh 's death Wilfrid attached himself to Cædwalla ; the Life of Wilfrid records that Cædwalla sought Wilfrid out as a spiritual father . Bede states that Cædwalla vowed to give a quarter of the Isle of Wight to the church if he conquered the island , and that Wilfrid was the beneficiary when the vow was fulfilled ; Bede also says that Cædwalla agreed to let the heirs of Arwald , the king of the Isle of Wight , be baptised before they were executed . Two of Cædwalla 's charters were grants of land to Wilfrid , and there is also subsequent evidence that Cædwalla worked with Wilfrid and Eorcenwald , a bishop of the East Saxons , to establish an ecclesiastical infrastructure for Sussex .

  "A few Japanese trading companies established businesses at Chuuk and Pohnpei in the 1890s , and Koben Mori acted as its resident agent , helping to facilitate trade with the islanders . The early Japanese businessmen traded on alcoholic products , explosives and Chinaware . Contraband products like alcohol and weapons were also illegally traded , and the Spanish administration made futile attempts to suppress these activities . The Japanese traders were expelled from Chuuk and Pohnpei in 1900 when the Germans purchased the islands from Spain , but Japanese traders returned to Chuuk in 1907 and set up a trading firm dealing with copra production . After the Japanese annexed Micronesia from Germany in 1914 , they gained a monopoly over the shipping routes in all of the mandated islands . The rate of copra production reached twelve thousand tons per year by the 1920s , and had an export value of two million yen . In the late 1920s , an Okinawan fisherman , Tamashiro established a tuna production factory at Wonei . The Japanese government provided incentives for fishermen to open new fishery production factories , and in 1937 there were at least 1500 Okinawans and Japanese who were employed in the fishery industry . Japanese settlers introduced commercial agriculture in Pohnpei and to a smaller extent in Chuuk and Yap . A few Japanese businessmen also set up firms to oversee the plantation of cash crops , including copra , rice and pineapples .

  "Welders often develop a technique of rapidly alternating between moving the torch forward ( to advance the weld pool ) and adding filler metal . The filler rod is withdrawn from the weld pool each time the electrode advances , but it is always kept inside the gas shield to prevent oxidation of its surface and contamination of the weld . Filler rods composed of metals with a low melting temperature , such as aluminum , require that the operator maintain some distance from the arc while staying inside the gas shield . If held too close to the arc , the filler rod can melt before it makes contact with the weld puddle . As the weld nears completion , the arc current is often gradually reduced to allow the weld crater to solidify and prevent the formation of crater cracks at the end of the weld .",

Other researchers have interpreted these ridges as modified versions of similar structures in other ornithischians which might have supported fleshy cheeks , rather than beaks .

When the latter was briefly toppled in a Bahri revolt in 1389 , the Buhturids fought against the Bahri rebels in Damascus , while the Turkmen tribesmen assaulted the Druze Tanukhi tribesmen in Beirut and the surrounding hills .

  "As the bird became extinct before significant field observations could be made , not much is known about its behaviour . It is believed to have been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground . It roosted in pairs or small groups of three or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame , allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost . The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests , particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves . It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek , who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904 . Despite many subsequent searches , the bird has not been definitively reported since . It is believed to have been rare when Meek collected his specimens . The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats , as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul . The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s , and the species is considered extinct .",

  "What the technology and the visual experiences were can only be tenuously inferred from stage directions . Milhous concludes from a review of Dorset Garden performances that \" at a conservative estimate \" the theatre was equipped to fly at least four people independently , and had some very complex floor traps for \" transformations \" such as that of Proteus . The plates printed in the first edition of Elkanah Settle 's Empress of Morocco ( 1673 ) ( see detail , top right ) are the only pictures of actual Restoration stage sets . Pepys ' mentions of stage effects in his diary , 1660 – 68 , give the modern reader some help in visualising what audiences saw in the 1660s , and even more in entering into their enthusiasms , but the 1660s were still early days .

  "Lacking legitimacy or permission , Charlotte was unable to marry . Thus , she otherwise sought a protector and provider .

Her children were kept secret , and remained largely unknown until the 20th century . When Charlotte eventually left France for Florence , she entrusted the children – and she was only just recovering from her son 's birth – to the care of her mother , and it appears that few , and certainly not her father , knew of their existence .",

  "After World War II , a debate about whether a country should introduce financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged . Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists . It is an administrative problem . The crucial idea was that a large amount of well dispersed investment should be made in the economy , so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels , increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question . However , it should be noted that most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates . Further , the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks .",
