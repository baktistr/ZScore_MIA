  "Arriving in Tokyo , O 'Brien was nominated in the 200 m event and the medley relay ; the 100 m event was yet to be included in the Olympic program . The favourites for the 200 m breaststroke were Chet Jastremski of the United States — the world record holder — and Georgy Prokopenko of the Soviet Union . Gathercole had modelled O 'Brien 's technique on that of Jastremski , attempting to refine and smoothen it . Years after O 'Brien retired , Harry Gallagher said that \" Ian O 'Brien has an almost faultless style and is a great example for Australian youngsters to copy \" . O 'Brien was known for the strength that his torso generated , and his powerful kicks ; sports science experiments showed that his vertical jump was especially strong . O 'Brien was also known for his efficient start . He often gained a lead of approximately a metre from his dive and underwater glide at the start , and was able to complete 50 m in 31 @.@ 0 s .",
  "With the arrival of Romantic sentiments in the late 18th century , El Greco 's works were examined anew . To French writer Théophile Gautier , El Greco was the precursor of the European Romantic movement in all its craving for the strange and the extreme . Gautier regarded El Greco as the ideal romantic hero ( the \" gifted \" , the \" misunderstood \" , the \" mad \" ) , and was the first who explicitly expressed his admiration for El Greco 's later technique . French art critics Zacharie Astruc and Paul Lefort helped to promote a widespread revival of interest in his painting . In the 1890s , Spanish painters living in Paris adopted him as their guide and mentor . However , in the popular English @-@ speaking imagination he remained the man who \" painted horrors in the Escorial \" in the words of Ephraim Chambers ' Cyclopaedia in 1899 .",

  "Photons , like all quantum objects , exhibit wave @-@ like and particle @-@ like properties . Their dual wave – particle nature can be difficult to visualize . The photon displays clearly wave @-@ like phenomena such as diffraction and interference on the length scale of its wavelength . For example , a single photon passing through a double @-@ slit experiment exhibits interference phenomena but only if no measure was made at the slit . A single photon passing through a double @-@ slit experiment lands on the screen with a probability distribution given by its interference pattern determined by Maxwell 's equations . However , experiments confirm that the photon is not a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation ; it does not spread out as it propagates , nor does it divide when it encounters a beam splitter . Rather , the photon seems to be a point @-@ like particle since it is absorbed or emitted as a whole by arbitrarily small systems , systems much smaller than its wavelength , such as an atomic nucleus ( ≈ 10 − 15 m across ) or even the point @-@ like electron . Nevertheless , the photon is not a point @-@ like particle whose trajectory is shaped probabilistically by the electromagnetic field , as conceived by Einstein and others ; that hypothesis was also refuted by the photon @-@ correlation experiments cited above . According to our present understanding , the electromagnetic field itself is produced by photons , which in turn result from a local gauge symmetry and the laws of quantum field theory ( see the Second quantization and Gauge boson sections below ) .",
  "Subsequent to the closing of the canon , the gospel is mentioned in a homily \" On the Virgin Mary \" attributed to Cyril of Jerusalem in a collection of apocryphal stories believed to have been written in Coptic in the first half of the 6th century . The author ( known to scholars as Pseudo @-@ Cyril ) refers to the Gospel of the Hebrews in a polemical dialogue between a monk and Cyril over the nature of Mary , whom the monk contends was a divine Power sent from heaven . Cyril condemns the monk 's teaching as a heresy , which the author attributes to Carpocrates , Satornilus , and Ebionites . Not all later mentions of the gospel were polemical ; Bede ( c . 673 – 735 ) , after listing some apocryphal gospels rejected by the Church , includes the Gospel of the Hebrews among the \" ecclesiastical histories \" and refers to its usage by Jerome .",

  "Military analysts and historians disagree on the strategic significance of the battle , although most describe it as a British tactical and operational success . In 1919 , Ludendorff wrote that the British victory cost the German army dear and drained German reserves . Hindenburg wrote that the losses at Messines had been very heavy and that he regretted that the ground had not been evacuated ; in 1922 , Kuhl called it one of the worst German tragedies of the war . In 1920 Haig 's Dispatches described the success of the British plan , organisation and results but refrained from hyperbole , referring to the operation as a successful preliminary to the main offensive at Ypres . In 1930 , Liddell Hart thought the success at Messines inflated expectations for the Third Battle of Ypres and that because the circumstances of the operations were different , attempts to apply similar tactics resulted in failure . In 1938 Lloyd George called the battle an apéritif and in 1939 , G. C. Wynne judged it to be a \" brilliant success \" , overshadowed by the subsequent tragedy of the Battles of Passchendaele . The Official Historian called it a \" great victory \" in 1948 and Prior and Wilson ( 1997 ) called the battle a \" noteworthy success \" but then complained about the decision to postpone exploitation of the success on the Gheluvelt plateau . Ashley Ekins referred to the battle as a great set @-@ piece victory , which was also costly , particularly for the infantry of II Anzac Corps , as did Christopher Pugsley , referring to the experience of the New Zealand Division . Heinz Hagenlücke called it a great British success and wrote that the loss of the ridge , had a worse effect on German morale than the number of casualties . Jack Sheldon called it a \" significant victory \" for the British and a \" disaster \" for the German army , which was forced into a \" lengthy period of anxious waiting \" . Brown in 1996 and Simpson in 2001 concluded that extending British supply routes over the ridge , which had been devastated by the mines and millions of shells , to consolidate the Oosttaverne line and completion of the infrastructure further north in the Fifth Army area , was necessary before the \" Northern Operation \" ( the Third Battle of Ypres ) could begin and was the main reason for the operational pause in June and July .",

While they can germinate in total darkness if proper conditions are present ( tests give a 35 % germination rate under ideal conditions ) , in the wild , they in practice only do so when exposed to light , or very close to the soil surface , which explains the plant 's habitat preferences .

He is believed to have been the first to have undertaken this self @-@ operation . Dr. Kane did this , in part , to experience the procedure from the patient 's perspective . He had in mind using local anaesthesia in future on patients with medical conditions that prevented a general anaesthetic being administered , and wanted to ensure that the procedure could be tolerated by the patient . Kane believed ether ( the usual general anaesthetic of the time ) was used too often and was more dangerous than local anaesthetics . The anaesthetic used by Kane was novocaine , a fairly recent replacement for the more dangerous cocaine . Kane performed the operation , which he had carried out nearly 4 @,@ 000 times on others , with the aid of mirrors that enabled him to see the work area . At this time the operation was rather more major than today , as the incision to remove an appendix was much larger than that needed for modern keyhole surgery techniques . Nevertheless , Kane was well enough to be taken home the following day .",

  "Show runners Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein were fans of actor Phil Hartman , who had been a recurring guest star since the second season . They decided to produce an episode entirely about his character Troy McClure to give Hartman as much to do as possible . Oakley wanted to explore Troy 's character because he had never interacted with the show 's other characters before , only appearing on television . The writers chose the plot idea of Troy 's marriage to Selma Bouvier because she was \" always marrying people \" . The episode 's first draft was written by freelance writer Jack Barth , although the rest of the writing staff rewrote it . One aspect of the rewrite was the song \" Dr. Zaius \" from the Planet of the Apes musical , which the staff consider to be one of the greatest musical numbers ever written for The Simpsons . Weinstein pitched it in the writer 's room as \" Rock Me Dr. Zaius \" , in parody of the 1985 song \" Rock Me Amadeus \" by Falco . It expanded into a full song primarily concocted by George Meyer , who included \" corny \" aspects of vaudeville . The line \" From chimpan @-@ A to chimpan @-@ Z \" in the final song of the musical was written by David Cohen . Oakley commented that he has heard the line \" all over the world \" . Director Mark Kirkland was pleased that Troy was the star of the episode ; he enjoyed interpreting Hartman 's voice performance because it allowed him and the other animators to \" open [ McClure ] up visually as a character \" . Due to the slow talking speed of Troy and Selma , the episode 's audio track was 28 minutes long which meant that multiple scenes had to be cut , including Troy 's bachelor party . After the cast had completed their original recording , guest star Jeff Goldblum rerecorded his dialogue as MacArthur Parker at a faster speed to further shorten it . His character 's design was loosely modeled on him , as well as a real @-@ life \" sleazy Hollywood agent \" .

  "The RAAF 's twelve C @-@ 130As were picked up by their newly trained Australian pilots from the Lockheed factory at Dobbins Air Force Base , Georgia , and ferried to Australia in three groups between December 1958 and March 1959 . No. 36 Squadron , located at RAAF Base Richmond , became the first unit to operate the new aircraft . Almost immediately they established regular courier services within Australia and to RAAF Base Butterworth in Malaya . These flights primarily involved transporting cargo , as Chief of the Air Staff Frederick Scherger directed in 1959 that the RAAF would continue to rely on chartered civil airliners to move military personnel on the grounds that these aircraft were better suited to the task and in wartime all the C @-@ 130s would be needed to supply troops near the front lines . In February 1960 a Hercules flew the RAAF 's first AIM @-@ 9 Sidewinder missiles from the United States to Butterworth to equip the CAC Sabre fighters based there .

Only seasoned transport pilots flew the Hercules in its early years of service , generally having undertaken a tour of duty with No. 38 Squadron 's Dakotas . The official history of the post @-@ war Air Force described the Hercules as \" probably the biggest step @-@ up in aircraft capabilities \" the RAAF had ever received , considering it roughly four times as effective as the Dakota , taking into account the improvements in payload , range , and speed . When No. 78 ( Fighter ) Wing and its two squadrons of CAC Sabres deployed to Butterworth between October 1958 and February 1959 , seven Dakotas were required to ferry the staff and equipment of No. 3 Squadron from Australia to Malaya , compared to two Hercules for No. 77 Squadron . The Hercules were the first turboprop aircraft operated by the RAAF . They were serviced by No. 486 Maintenance Squadron , with deeper maintenance and upgrades carried out by No. 2 Aircraft Depot ( No. 2 AD ) , both units being based at Richmond .

The simultaneous winding down of Apple Corps ' subsidiaries left a number of music and film projects in jeopardy , which resulted in Harrison having to make regular trips to Los Angeles in order to find a distributor for the Shankar Family & Friends album , most of which was recorded in California in April 1973 , and Splinter 's debut , The Place I Love .

  "Released in 1988 , the Sega Genesis ( known as the Sega Mega Drive in Europe and Japan ) was Sega 's entry into the fourth generation of video game consoles . Selling 30 @.@ 75 million units worldwide , the Genesis was the most successful console Sega ever released . The successor to the Genesis , the Sega Saturn , was released in Japan in 1994 . The Saturn was a CD @-@ ROM @-@ based console that displayed both 2D and 3D computer graphics , but its complex dual @-@ CPU architecture made it more difficult to program for than its chief competitor , the Sony PlayStation . Although the Saturn debuted before the PlayStation in both Japan and the United States , its surprise U.S. launch — which came four months earlier than originally scheduled — was marred by a lack of distribution , which remained a continuing problem for the system . Moreover , Sega 's early release was undermined by Sony 's simultaneous announcement that the PlayStation would retail for US $ 299 — compared to the Saturn 's initial price of $ 399 . Nintendo 's long delay in releasing a competing 3D console and the damage done to Sega 's reputation by poorly supported add @-@ ons for the Genesis ( particularly the Sega 32X ) allowed Sony to establish a foothold in the market . The PlayStation was immediately successful in the U.S. , in part due to a massive advertising campaign and strong third @-@ party support engendered by Sony 's excellent development tools and liberal $ 10 licensing fee . Sony 's success was further aided by a price war in which Sega lowered the price of the Saturn from $ 399 to $ 299 and then from $ 299 to $ 199 in order to match the price of the PlayStation – even though Saturn hardware was more expensive to manufacture and the PlayStation enjoyed a larger software library . Losses on the Saturn hardware contributed to Sega 's financial problems , which saw the company 's revenue decline between 1992 and 1995 as part of an industry @-@ wide slowdown .

  "The equipment of the Libyan line infantry has been much debated . Head has argued in favor of short stabbing spears . Polybius states that the Libyans fought with equipment taken from previously defeated Romans . It is unclear whether he meant only shields and armor or offensive weapons as well , though a general reading suggests he meant the whole panoply of arms and armor , and even tactical organization . Apart from his description of the battle itself , when later discussing the subject of the Roman legion versus the Greek phalanx , Polybius says that \" ... against Hannibal , the defeats they suffered had nothing to do with weapons or formations \" because \" Hannibal himself ... discarded the equipment with which he had started out ( and ) armed his troops with Roman weapons \" . Daly is inclined to the view that Libyan infantry would have copied the Iberian use of the sword during their fighting there and so were armed similarly to the Romans . Connolly has argued that they were armed as a pike phalanx . This has been disputed by Head , because Plutarch states they carried spears shorter than the Roman Triarii and by Daly because they could not have carried an unwieldy pike at the same time as a heavy Roman @-@ style shield .",
  "In addition to prerogative orders , the equitable remedy of a declaration can be employed to control an excess of legal authority . A declaration is a pronouncement by a court stating the legal position between the parties to an action , based on the facts that have been presented to the court .

The Eye goddess drinks the beer , mistaking it for blood , and in her inebriated state returns to Ra without noticing her intended victims .

Sophocles was born a few years before the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC : the exact year is unclear , although 497 / 6 is the most likely .

  "Parma was more than willing to help . The Electorate , strategically important to Spain , offered another land route by which to approach the rebellious northern Provinces of the Netherlands . Although the Spanish road from Spain 's holdings on the Mediterranean shores led to its territories in what is today Belgium , it was a long , arduous march , complicated by the provisioning of troops and the potentially hostile populations of the territories through which it passed . An alternative route on the Rhine promised better access to the Habsburg Netherlands . Furthermore , the presence of a Calvinist electorate almost on the Dutch border could delay their efforts to bring the rebellious Dutch back to the Spanish rule and the Catholic confession . Philip II and his generals could be convinced to support Ernst 's cause for such considerations . Indeed , the process of intervention had started earlier . In 1581 , Philip 's forces , paid for by papal gold , had taken Aachen , which Protestants had seized ; by the mid – 1580s , the Duke of Parma 's forces , encouraged by the Wittelsbachs and the Catholics in Cologne , had secured garrisons throughout the northern territories of the Electorate .

  "The picture painted by the few and scattered references to the Cretan emirate from the Muslim world , on the other hand , is of an ordered state with a regular monetary economy and extensive trade links , and there is evidence that Chandax was a cultural centre of some importance . The survival of numerous gold , silver , and copper coins , of almost constant weight and composition , testifies to a strong economy and a high living standard among the population . The economy was strengthened by extensive trade with the rest of the Muslim world , especially with Egypt , and by a booming agriculture : the need to sustain an independent state , as well as access to the markets of the Muslim world , led to an intensification of cultivation . It is also possible that sugar cane was introduced to Crete at the time .",

  "Louis Braille survived the torment of the infection but by the age of five he was completely blind in both eyes . Due to his young age , Braille did not realize at first that he had lost his sight , and often asked why it was always dark . His devoted parents made great efforts – quite uncommon for the era – to raise their youngest child in a normal fashion , and he prospered in their care . He learned to navigate the village and country paths with canes his father hewed for him , and he grew up seemingly at peace with his disability . Braille 's bright and creative mind impressed the local teachers and priests , and he was accommodated with higher education .",
  "The Royals ' farm system was ranked number one in baseball entering the 2011 season , led by Hosmer and another top prospect , third baseman Mike Moustakas . Most baseball critics agreed that the Royals , a team that was known for mediocrity the past two decades , would be a contender within a couple of years , and they had nine prospects in Baseball America 's top 100 , a record for the publication . Hosmer was ranked as the best first baseman prospect in Major League Baseball prior to the 2011 season . He was also rated the eighth best overall prospect by Baseball America , and the top Royals prospect overall . So much hype was placed on the Royals that general manager Dayton Moore traded the team 's best player , Cy Young Award winner Zack Greinke to the Milwaukee Brewers for four top prospects , to focus on the team 's future . Hosmer began the season with the Royals Class AAA affiliate , the Omaha Storm Chasers of the Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) .

  "Originally , the decision to move Missouri to Pearl Harbor was met with some resistance . The National Park Service expressed concern that the battleship , whose name has become synonymous with the end of World War II , would overshadow the battleship Arizona , whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking on 7 December 1941 has since become synonymous with the attack on Pearl Harbor . To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial , so that those participating in military ceremonies on Missouri 's aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial . The decision to have Missouri 's bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizona 's hull may rest in peace .",

On the top of the spinae stood small tables or frames supported on pillars , and also small pieces of marble in the shape of eggs or dolphins . The spina eventually became very elaborate , with statues and obelisks and other forms of art , but the multiplication of the adornments of the spina had one unfortunate result : They became so numerous that they obstructed the view of spectators on lower seats . At either end of the spina was a meta , or turning point , in the form of large gilded columns . Spectacular crashes took place there , as in the Greek races , in which the chariot was destroyed and the charioteer and horses incapacitated were known as naufragia , also the Latin word for shipwrecks .",
  "\" Dry \" , or \" Closed \" diving bells are pressure vessels for human occupation which can be deployed from the surface to transport divers to the underwater workplace at pressures greater than ambient . They are equalized to ambient pressure at the depth where the divers will get out and back in after the dive , and are then re @-@ sealed for transport back to the surface , which also generally takes place with controlled internal pressure greater than ambient . During and / or after the recovery from depth , the divers may be decompressed in the same way as if they were in a decompression chamber , so in effect , the dry bell is a mobile decompression chamber . Another option , used in saturation diving , is to decompress to storage pressure ( pressure in the habitat part of the saturation spread ) and then transfer the divers to the saturation habitat under pressure ( transfer under pressure – TUP ) , where they will stay until the next shift , or until decompressed at the end of the saturation period .",

Dayton claimed that the impasse was the doing of \" extreme right @-@ wing \" freshman Republican legislators whom he did not talk to , and that he had cordial relationships with Republican leaders . In a statement at the end of the session on May 23 , Dayton said \" Here I am in the middle — and they haven 't moved \" .

  "Symbolic interaction ; often associated with Interactionism , Phenomenological sociology , Dramaturgy , Interpretivism , is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes , generally accessed through micro @-@ analysis . This tradition emerged in the Chicago School of the 1920s and 1930s , which prior to World War II \" had been the center of sociological research and graduate study \" . The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals . Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another . This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand . Therefore , society is a complex , ever @-@ changing mosaic of subjective meanings . Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation , and disregards the effects that culture , race or gender ( i.e. social @-@ historical structures ) may have in that situation . Some important sociologists associated with this approach include Max Weber , George Herbert Mead , Erving Goffman , George Homans and Peter Blau .

  "The dental effects of long @-@ term methamphetamine use are often attributed to its effects on saliva . The reduction in saliva increases the likelihood of dental caries , enamel erosion , and periodontal disease . Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva , the mechanism by which it does so is unclear . One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction ( narrowing of the blood vessels ) in salivary glands , decreasing salivary flow . This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha @-@ adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine , the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use . These factors can be compounded by dehydration , which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug @-@ induced increases in metabolism . The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug , which includes high protein content , may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth .",

  "At its most fundamental , it was a local feud between two competing dynastic interests — the Seneschals ( Truchsess ) of the House of Waldburg and the dukes of the House of Wittelsbach — that acquired religious overtones . The dispute had broad implications in the political , social , and dynastic balance of the Holy Roman Empire . It tested the principle of ecclesiastical reservation established in the religious Peace of Augsburg ( 1555 ) . The 1555 agreement settled religious problems in the Empire with the principle Cuius regio , eius religio : the subjects of a secular prince followed the religion of their sovereign . Ecclesiastical reservation excluded the territories of the imperial prelates ( bishops , archbishops , abbots or abbesses ) from cuius regio , eius religio . In an ecclesiastical territory , if the prelate changed his religion , his subjects did not have to do so . Instead , the prelate was expected to resign from his post .

  "Gas tungsten arc welding , because it affords greater control over the weld area than other welding processes , can produce high @-@ quality welds when performed by skilled operators . Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness — all equipment and materials used must be free from oil , moisture , dirt and other impurities , as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality . To remove oil and grease , alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used , while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum . Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit . These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used , because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process , unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current . To maintain a clean weld pool during welding , the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere . GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld , increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors .",

  "Tyrannosaurus may have had infectious saliva used to kill its prey . This theory was first proposed by William Abler . Abler examined the teeth of tyrannosaurids between each tooth serration ; the serrations may have held pieces of carcass with bacteria , giving Tyrannosaurus a deadly , infectious bite much like the Komodo dragon was thought to have . However , Jack Horner regards Tyrannosaurus tooth serrations as more like cubes in shape than the serrations on a Komodo monitor 's teeth , which are rounded . All forms of saliva contain possibly hazardous bacteria , so the prospect of it being used as a method of predation is disputable .",

  "In her work How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion , Susan Feldman argues that abortion should be defended according to Kantian ethics . She proposed that a woman should be treated as a dignified autonomous person , with control over their body , as Kant suggested . She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics , requiring abortion to be the mother 's decision . Dean Harris has noted that , if Kantian ethics is to be used in the discussion of abortion , it must be decided whether a fetus is an autonomous person . Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals . Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age ( such as babies or fetuses ) or mental disability , agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves , equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion .",

  "Within the largest political divisions of the Song known as circuits ( lu ) there were a number of prefectures ( zhou ) , which in turn were divided into the smallest political units of counties ( xian ) ; there were about 1 @,@ 230 counties during the Song period . The prefect during the early Northern Song was the prime official of local government authority , who was the lowest regional official allowed to memorialize the throne , was primary tax collector , and head magistrate over several magistrates within his jurisdiction that dealt with civil disputes and maintaining order . By the late Northern Song , the growth in the number of counties with different proportions in population under a prefect 's jurisdiction decreased the importance of the latter office , as it became more difficult for the prefect to manage the counties . This was part of a larger continuum of administrative trends from the Tang to Ming dynasties , with the gradual decline of importance of intermediate administrative units — the prefectures — alongside a shift of power from central government to large regional administrations ; the latter experienced progressively less influence of central government in their routine affairs . In the Southern Song , four semi @-@ autonomous regional command systems were established based on territorial and military units ; this influenced the model of detached service secretariats which became the provincial administrations ( sheng ) of the Yuan ( 1279 – 1368 ) , Ming ( 1368 – 1644 ) , and Qing ( 1644 – 1912 ) dynasties . The administrative control of the Southern Song central government over the empire became increasingly limited to the circuits located in closer proximity to the capital at Hangzhou , while those farther away practiced greater autonomy .",
  "\" Dead Celebrities \" makes frequent mention of the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain , describing the food as extremely tasty , but claiming it resulted in bloody stool .

In the episode 's commentary , Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle , but found it funnier to use a restaurant with a healthy reputation rather than a place like McDonald 's or Taco Bell .

  "Suillus luteus can be found all over the Northern Hemisphere . Native to Eurasia , it is widespread across the British Isles . To the east it has been recorded from Pakistan , where it was found along canals in Dashkin in the district of Astore , and as far east as South Korea . It has also been widely introduced elsewhere by way of pine plantations around the globe . It is very commonly found in Monterey pine ( Pinus radiata ) plantations , despite the tree being native to California and hence not in the fungus ' native range . In North America it is found in the northeast , the Pacific Northwest and the southwestern United States . According to Ernst Both , it was Charles Horton Peck who first suggested in 1887 that the fungus was introduced to New York State on Pinus sylvestris . DNA studies show that the North American populations differ little genetically from European populations , supporting the idea that the fungus arrived to North America relatively recently as a result of human activity . Suillus luteus is found in coastal and mountainous pine forests and exhibits a tolerance of the northern latitudes . Southern Hemisphere locales where the slippery jack grow with plantation pines include South America , Africa , Australia , and New Zealand . In southwestern Australia , the bolete is limited to areas of greater than 1000 mm ( 40 in ) annual rainfall .

  "During the First Barons ' War ( 1215 – 1217 ) in King John 's reign , baronial forces captured the castle from Archbishop Stephen Langton and held it against the king , who then besieged it . The Barnwell chronicler remarked \" Our age has not known a siege so hard pressed nor so strongly resisted \" . After resisting for just over seven weeks , the garrison surrendered . Although the castle had been greatly damaged , with breaches in the outer walls and one corner of the keep collapsed , it was hunger that eventually forced the defenders ' hand . The castle did not stay under John 's control for long : in 1216 it was captured by the French Prince Louis , who was the new leader of the baronial faction . John died and was succeeded by his son King Henry III in 1216 ; the next year , the war ended and the castle was taken under direct royal control .",

The inclusion of Spanish Louisiana into New Spain meant that Texas was no longer essentially a buffer province .

However , in 1799 Spain gave Louisiana back to France , and in 1803 Napoléon Bonaparte ( and France ) sold the territory , known as the Louisiana Purchase , to the United States . U.S. President Thomas Jefferson insisted that the purchase included all land to the east of the Rocky Mountains and to the north of the Rio Grande , although its large southwestern expanse was within New Spain .

  "MacDonald 's administration lasted less than a year before , in November 1924 , the Liberals withdrew their support ; Blythe comments that the first Labour government had been \" neither exhilarating nor competent \" . According to Shepherd , MacDonald 's chief priority was to show that Labour was \" fit to govern \" , and he had thus acted with conservative caution . The December general election returned the Conservatives to power ; Lansbury maintained that Labour 's cause \" marches forward irrespective of electoral results \" . After the defeat Lansbury was briefly touted as an alternative party leader to MacDonald , a proposition he rejected . In 1925 , free from the Daily Herald , he founded and edited Lansbury 's Labour Weekly , which became a mouthpiece for his personal creed of socialism , democracy and pacifism until it merged with the New Leader in 1927 . Before the General Strike of May 1926 , Lansbury used the Weekly to instruct the Trades Union Congress ( TUC ) on preparations for the coming struggle .

Judge Thokozile Masipa agreed to a request for the evaluation by prosecutor Gerrie Nel after forensic psychiatrist Merryll Vorster testified for the defence that she had diagnosed Pistorius with generalized anxiety disorder . On 30 June 2014 , the trial resumed after the evaluation reports which said Pistorius could be held criminally responsible .

  "Waterbuck are rather sedentary in nature . A gregarious animal , the waterbuck may form herds consisting of six to 30 individuals . These groups are either nursery herds with females and their offspring or bachelor herds . Males start showing territorial behaviour from the age of five years , but are most dominant from the age of six to nine . The waterbuck can not tolerate dehydration in hot weather , and thus inhabits areas close to sources of water . Predominantly a grazer , the waterbuck is mostly found on grassland . In equatorial regions , breeding takes place throughout the year , but births are at their peak in the rainy season . The gestational period lasts for seven to eight months , followed by the birth of a single calf .",

Lambert and Stamp realised that commercial success in the US was paramount to the group 's future , and arranged a deal with promoter Frank Barsalona for a short package tour in New York . The group 's performances , which still involved smashing guitars and kicking over drums , were well received , and led to their first major US appearance at the Monterey Pop Festival . The group , especially Moon , were not fond of the hippie movement , and thought their violent stage act would stand in sharp contrast to the peaceful atmosphere of the festival .

Another well @-@ preserved skeleton from the slightly older Horseshoe Canyon Formation , in Alberta , Canada , was named T. warreni by William Parks in 1926 . This skeleton had notable differences from T. neglectus , and so Charles M. Sternberg placed it in a new genus , Parksosaurus , in 1937 . Sternberg also named an additional species , T. edmontonensis , based on another articulated skeleton , this time including a partial skull ( NMC 8537 ) , and drew attention to the genus ' heavy build and thick bones . Due to these differences from the regular light hypsilophodont build , he suggested that the genus warranted its own subfamily , Thescelosaurinae . T. edmontonensis has , since Peter Galton 's 1974 review , generally been considered a more robust individual ( possibly the opposite sex of the type individual ) of T. neglectus . However , Boyd and colleagues found that they could not assign it to either of their valid species of Thescelosaurus and regarded the specimen as of uncertain placement within the genus . The other point of contention regarding T. edmontonensis is its ankle , which Galton claimed was damaged and misinterpreted , but which was regarded by William J.

  "The self @-@ damage induced by the radioactivity of einsteinium is so strong that it rapidly destroys the crystal lattice , and the energy release during this process , 1000 watts per gram of 253Es , induces a visible glow .

Further , owing to the small size of the available samples , the melting point of einsteinium was often deduced by observing the sample being heated inside an electron microscope . Thus the surface effects in small samples could reduce the melting point value .",

  "The Peace Association was dominated by Liberal Party politicians — from a Marxist perspective , \" bourgeois \" people . Historian Nils Ivar Agøy had noted that the socialists who were active in the bourgeois peace movement — the most prominent being Koht , Adam Egede @-@ Nissen and Carl Bonnevie — were \" radicalised sons of the bourgeoisie \" . This meant that they were \" capable of asserting themselves among the ship @-@ owners and county governors in the board \" of the Norwegian Peace Association . Koht also followed his own goals during his first period as chairman . He wanted to tie the \" apolitical \" peace movement closer to the labour movement , to create \" economic justice \" and to employ the use of arbitration in labour conflicts . These goals were not embraced by all of the members , particularly not those who wanted to keep the Peace Association politically neutral . A larger problem , however , was that Koht rated Norwegian nationalism higher than pacifism . He had thus carried out his compulsory military service \" with fervor \" , notes Agøy . Koht demanded that the Peace Association did not resist to an armed defense of the \" fatherland \" . The national convention in 1902 refused to acknowledge this principle , and Koht therefore resigned his membership . He was followed by others , as a result of a schism in the Peace Association between the pacifists and the more pragmatic peace activists . Koht has also been assessed as an ineffective organisational leader . The defense question more or less solved itself when the Swedish @-@ Norwegian union was peacefully dissolved in 1905 . Koht later returned to the Peace Association to serve as a board member from 1910 to 1912 .",
  "Another key elements to Durkheim 's theory of knowledge is his concept of représentations collectives ( collective representations ) , which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life . Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas , beliefs , and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents . They can include words , slogans , ideas , or any number of material items that can serve as a symbol , such as a cross , a rock , a temple , a feather etc . As Durkheim elaborates , représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity . As such these representations have the particular , and somewhat contradictory , aspect that they exist externally to the individual ( since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole ) , and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society ( by virtue of that individual 's participation within society ) .",

  "At the same time , Irving maintained an ambivalent attitude to Holocaust denial depending on his audience . In a 1993 letter , Irving lashed out against his former friend Zündel , writing that : \" In April 1988 I unhesitatingly agreed to aid your defence as a witness in Toronto . I would not make the same mistake again . As a penalty for having defended you then , and for having continued to aid you since , my life has come under a gradually mounting attack : I find myself the worldwide victim of mass demonstrations , violence , vituperation and persecution \" ( emphasis in the original ) . Irving went on to claim his life had been wonderful until Zündel had got him involved in the Holocaust denial movement ; van Pelt argues that Irving was just trying to shift responsibility for his actions in his letter . In an interview with Australian radio in July 1995 , Irving claimed that at least four million Jews died in World War II , though he argued that this was due to terrible sanitary conditions inside the concentration camps as opposed to a deliberate policy of genocide in the death camps . Irving 's statement led to a very public spat with his former ally Faurisson , who insisted that no Jews were killed in the Holocaust .

The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger 's novel titled Jud Süß ( 1925 ) based on a play that he had written in 1916 but subsequently withdrew . As a Jew , Feuchtwanger did not intend his portrayal of Süß to be antisemitic but rather as a study of the tragedy caused by the human weaknesses of greed , pride , and ambition . With an interest in exploring the challenges confronting Jews in the Diaspora , Feuchtwanger was particularly concerned with the issues of conversion and antisemitism . He was particularly struck by the fact that Süß could have saved himself by converting to Christianity but had steadfastly refused to do so , opting instead to return to formal Jewish observance and piety .",

  "Playwright Horton Foote reportedly considered giving up on film writing , due to what he regarded as a poor adaption of his 1952 play The Chase into a 1966 film of the same name . Following what Foote saw as a far more successful adaption of his 1968 play Tomorrow in 1972 , his interest in filmmaking was rekindled , under the condition that he maintain some degree of control over the final product . Foote said of this stage in his career , \" I learned that film really should be like theatre in the sense that in theatre , the writer is , of course , very dominant ... If we don 't like something , we can speak our minds . ... It is always a collaborative effort . ... But in Hollywood it wasn 't so .

  "Following the Smithsonian Agreement , member states of the European Economic Community adopted a narrower currency band of 1 @.@ 125 % for exchange rates among their own currencies , creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel . The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies . In 1979 , the European Monetary System ( EMS ) phased out the currency snake . The EMS featured two key components : the European Currency Unit ( ECU ) , an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members ' currencies , and the Exchange Rate Mechanism ( ERM ) , a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies ' par values . The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system , denominated in terms of ECUs . The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket . Under the ERM , if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit ( within a 2 @.@ 25 % band ) , both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix . The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a key difference from the Bretton Woods system . Similarly to Bretton Woods however , EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds , as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU 's value . The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances , and were modified every eight months on average during the systems ' initial four years of operation . During its twenty @-@ year lifespan , these central rates were adjusted over 50 times .",

  "When the size of a planet is described using its radius this is approximating the shape by a sphere . However , the rotation of a planet causes it to be flattened at the poles so that the equatorial radius is larger than the polar radius , making it closer to an oblate spheroid . The oblateness of transiting exoplanets will affect the transit light curves . At the limits of current technology it has been possible to show that HD 189733b is less oblate than Saturn . If the planet is close to its star , then gravitational tides will elongate the planet in the direction of the star , so that the planet will be closer to a triaxial ellipsoid . Because tidal deformation is along a line between the planet and the star , it is difficult to detect from transit photometry — it will have an order of magnitude less effect on the transit light curves than that caused by rotational deformation even in cases where the tidal deformation is larger than rotational deformation ( such as is the case for tidally locked hot Jupiters ) . Material rigidity of rocky planets and rocky cores of gas planets will cause further deviations from the aforementioned shapes . Thermal tides caused by unevenly irradiated surfaces are another factor .",
  "Hollywood films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular heroics or self @-@ sacrifice , as in the popular Sands of Iwo Jima ( 1949 ) starring John Wayne . U.S. Marines considered Sands of Iwo Jima visually authentic , but found Lewis Milestone 's Battle Cry ( 1955 ) , with its attention to the lives of the men , the more realistic film .

Films based on real commando missions , like The Gift Horse ( 1952 ) based on the St. Nazaire Raid , and Ill Met by Moonlight ( 1956 ) based on the capture of the German commander of Crete , inspired fictional adventure films such as The Guns of Navarone ( 1961 ) , The Train ( 1964 ) and Where Eagles Dare ( 1968 ) .

York decided to carry on playing and were placed in the North East League , where they ranked eighth in their section of eleven clubs . In the final weeks of 1939 – 40 , York competed in the Football League War Cup . The club was placed in the Football League North for 1940 – 41 , and finished thirty @-@ second in the thirty @-@ six @-@ club league . They beat Sheffield Wednesday 7 – 0 in the War Cup , before being eliminated by Newcastle United in the second round . After completing eighteen fixtures in the 1941 – 42 Football League North , York competed in the league @-@ organised qualifying stage of the War Cup . They were eliminated after ranking thirty @-@ third of fifty @-@ four clubs , failing to qualify for the knock @-@ out stages by one place .

  "The alpha amino acids are the most common form found in nature , but only when occurring in the L @-@ isomer . The alpha carbon is a chiral carbon atom , with the exception of glycine which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon . Therefore , all alpha amino acids but glycine can exist in either of two enantiomers , called L or D amino acids , which are mirror images of each other ( see also Chirality ) . While L @-@ amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome , D @-@ amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum , as in exotic sea @-@ dwelling organisms such as cone snails . They are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria , and D @-@ serine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain . D @-@ amino acids are used in racemic crystallography to create centrosymmetric crystals , which ( depending on the protein ) may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination . The L and D convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can , in theory , be synthesized ( D @-@ glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory ; L @-@ glyceraldehyde is levorotatory ) . In alternative fashion , the ( S ) and ( R ) designators are used to indicate the absolute stereochemistry . Almost all of the amino acids in proteins are ( S ) at the α carbon , with cysteine being ( R ) and glycine non @-@ chiral . Cysteine has its side @-@ chain in the same geometric position as the other amino acids , but the R / S terminology is reversed because of the higher atomic number of sulfur compared to the carboxyl oxygen gives the side @-@ chain a higher priority , whereas the atoms in most other side @-@ chains give them lower priority .",
  "World War II had a significant impact on changing family roles . Because of the draft , workers were scarce in many industries and employers began to fill jobs with women , mainly in nontraditional positions . This increase in working women became one of the few times in history where women were praised for work outside the home . Divorce rates also reached a new high during this period . Not only had many women found a new sense of independence , but cultural shifts were underway , including the rise of feminism and the development of reliable methods of birth control . Such changes caused some women to decide to end their unhappy marriages .",

They were however disarmed and refused asylum , and were subsequently given light arms and sent back to Iraq on 4 August . They then decided to surrender themselves to the Iraqi Army . While crossing the Tigris in the Assyrian village of Dirabun , a clash erupted between the Assyrians and an Iraqi army brigade .

Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio , with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters , over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece . Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming unwillingly involved in the schemes of the trio , or on occasion having their own , separate storylines .",

  "In Tulee v. Washington , the United States Supreme Court once again ruled on the treaty rights of the Yakima tribe . In 1939 , Sampson Tulee , a Yakima , was arrested for fishing without a state fishing license . The United States government immediately filed for a writ of habeas corpus on Tulee 's behalf , which was denied on procedural grounds because he had not yet been tried in state court and had not exhausted his appeals . Tulee was convicted in state court , which was upheld by the Washington Supreme Court on the grounds that the state 's sovereignty allowed it to impose a fee on Indians who were fishing outside the reservation . The United States Supreme Court reversed , stating \" we are of the opinion that the state is without power to charge the Yakimas a fee for fishing \" .",

  "The tempo of the third movement is similar to that of the previous two , and subtle changes in dynamism and mode make it more complex and involving than it may at first appear . With a duration of approximately seventeen minutes , it comprises three verses in A minor and , like the first movement , is constructed from evolving variations on a simple motif . The melody is established in the opening verse , and the second and third verses revisit the cradling motifs of the second movement . As in the second movement , the motifs are built up from inversions of plain triads and seventh chords stretching across several octaves . As the soprano sings the final words , the key changes to a pure diatonic A major which accompanies , in writer David Ellis 's words , the \" ecstatic final stanza \" :",

  "The Marcomannic Wars fought during 166 – 180 AD were caused by the pressure exerted by the northern Germanic peoples ( settled around the area of today 's Poland ) on the tribes located in the vicinity of Roman limes , the Empire 's defended border . Expansion of the Proto @-@ Gothic Wielbark culture displaced from northern Greater Poland and Masovia the Przeworsk culture people ; they in turn , moving south and east , crossed during the third quarter of the 2nd century the Carpathian Mountains .

The Lubusz group there was absorbed by the new Luboszyce culture ( Luboszyce , Krosno Odrzańskie County ) , that occupied the middle Oder basin during the 140 – 430 AD period .

In the letter , Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit . Hindley , who had not replied to the first letter , responded by thanking Johnson for both letters , explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it . She claimed that , had Johnson written to her 14 years earlier , she would have confessed and helped the police . She also paid tribute to Topping , and thanked Johnson for her sincerity . Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987 . This time , the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher . She stayed overnight in Manchester , at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park , Prestwich , and visited the moor twice . She confirmed to police that the two areas in which they were concentrating their search — Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain — were correct , although she was unable to locate either of the graves . She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting next to her on a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky .",

  "The Indricotheriinae subfamily , to which Paraceratherium belongs , was first classified as part of the Hyracodontidae family by Leonard B. Radinsky in 1966 . Previously , they had been regarded as a subfamily within Rhinocerotidea , or even a full family , Indricotheriidae . In a 1999 cladistic study of tapiromorphs , Luke Holbrook found indricotheres to be outside the hyracodontid clade , and wrote that they may not be a monophyletic ( natural ) grouping . Radinsky 's scheme is the prevalent hypothesis today . The hyracodont family contains long @-@ legged members adapted to running , such as Hyracodon , and were distinguished by incisor characteristics . Indricotheres are distinguished from other hyracodonts by their larger size and the derived structure of their snouts , incisors and canines .

In the early 20th century , this corridor featured the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal , the Western Maryland Railway , and the National Pike , which ran between the canal and the railroad . When the Maryland State Roads Commission constructed the state road between Hancock and Licking Creek in 1915 , the highway was placed on a new alignment north of the railroad tracks to eliminate four grade crossings . This highway was designated US 40 in 1927 . The Heavenly Acres Ridge portion of MD 615 was paved from US 40 to the Pennsylvania state line in 1936 . By 1939 , White Oak Ridge Road was also marked as MD 615 . White Oak Ridge Road retained the state highway designation until 1956 .

Excitatory neurotransmitters , chemicals such as glutamate that serve to stimulate nerve cells , are released in excessive amounts . The resulting cellular excitation causes neurons to fire excessively . This creates an imbalance of ions such as potassium and calcium across the cell membranes of neurons ( a process like excitotoxicity ) .",

  "During the Ming Dynasty ( 1368 – 1644 ) , the Mongols enrolled in military service were either originally prisoners of war or they were those who voluntarily submitted to the Ming and settled in China . Others fled their homeland on the northern steppe due to natural disasters such as droughts , seeking refuge in China where Mongol families found lodging and hospitality . Some Mongols became distinguished military officers , were granted noble ranks , and on rarer occasions became ministers in the state bureaucracy . Mongols of noble lineage socialized with Chinese literati of the two capitals ( Nanjing and Beijing ) while they also had their sons educated in the Chinese classic texts . Nonetheless , Mongols in the Ming Empire were often held in suspicion by Chinese Ming authorities . Mongols of lower social stature were often accused by Chinese officials of being prone to violence , banditry , and becoming beggars and even prostitutes . Ming officials used the excuse of military campaigns to relocate and scatter Mongol troops and families throughout China so that they would not be concentrated in North China ( which neighbored the enemy territory of the Mongol heartland ) .

This was later also described in Sigmund Freud 's id , ego and super @-@ ego which was first linked to The Tempest in the 1956 screenplay for Forbidden Planet by Cyril Hume , Irving Block , and Allen Adler . The film presents Caliban reinterpreted as the ' monster from the Id ' , although the theory is dismissed as ' obsolete ' in that imagined future , and was also dismissed by James E Phillips in 1964 . Prospero is exiled to an island with a symbol of his baser , ' vegetative ' nature – Caliban – and his higher , ' sensitive ' or supernatural side – Ariel . Some productions have seen the same actor play all three roles , making them symbols of the conflict within a fully actualised or awakened Prospero – that between crude selfish physicality and a higher , mystical side . In the screenplay for Forbidden Planet it is revealed that the id monster is an externalization of Dr Morbius ' psyche .",

  "According to Leng 's study of All Things Must Pass , and to Whitlock 's recollection , Harrison played all of the song 's acoustic guitar parts . On what author Bruce Spizer notes as a \" delicate recording \" , these guitar lines accentuate the melody 's tumbling descents . Aside from Wright 's piano , the most prominent instrumentation on the recording is the trumpet and saxophone motif that opens and closes the song . Harrison vocalised the melody for this motif in his guide vocal on the basic track , before two other former Delaney & Bonnie sidemen , Jim Price and Bobby Keys , overdubbed the brass parts . This same motif later inspired Harrison 's song \" Soft Touch \" , written in the Virgin Islands in 1976 and issued on the George Harrison album three years later .",
  "When male blackcaps return to their breeding areas , they establish a territory . Adults that have previously bred return to the site they have used in previous summers , whereas inexperienced birds either wander until they find a suitable area , or establish a very large initial territory which contracts under pressure from neighbours .

  "Asus designed the Zenbooks with brushed aluminium chassis and high rigidity , rather than plastic , the usual laptop construction material . A pattern of concentric circles on the lids is said to represent ripples in water and represent the \" zen philosophy \" that designers wanted to portray when creating the laptops . Zenbooks have been generally well received due to their chassis design and appearance as well as the high quality screens used in later models . However , the touchpad software was found to be erratic , particularly on the early models and some of the models received criticism for their high prices . Some models ( such as the UX32 ) suffer from lockdown when the lithium polymer battery cell gets drained or discharged below its recommended threshold , for example if the device is left on and unattended .

  "Beneath the whimsical persona of the Chou , a serious connection to the form of Peking opera exists . The Chou is the character most connected to the guban , the drums and clapper commonly used for musically accompaniment during performances . The Chou actor often uses the guban in solo performance , especially when performing Shu Ban , light @-@ hearted verses spoken for comedic effect . The clown is also connected to the small gong and cymbals , percussion instruments that symbolize the lower classes and the raucous atmosphere inspired by the role . Although Chou characters do not sing frequently , their arias feature large amounts of improvisation . This is considered a license of the role , and the orchestra will accompany the Chou actor even as he bursts into an unscripted folk song . However , due to the standardization of Peking opera and political pressure from government authorities , Chou improvisation has lessened in recent years . The Chou has a vocal timbre that is distinct from other characters , as the character will often speak in the common Beijing dialect , as opposed to the more formal dialects of other characters .",
