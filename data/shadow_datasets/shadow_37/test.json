  "A common theme in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil , which Martin rejects for not mirroring the real world . Attracted to gray characters instead of orcs and angels , Martin instead endorses Nobel Prize laureate William Faulkner 's view that only the human heart in conflict with itself was worth writing about . Just like people 's capacity for good and for evil in real life , Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series . The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides , such that , unlike in many other fantasies , the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint . The reader may then decide about good and evil through the novels ' actions and politics .",

  "In his book on the history of ambient music , Mark Prendergast cites \" Long , Long , Long \" as a ballad \" noteworthy for its Ambient production \" . The idea for the end of the song was inspired by the sound created by a wine bottle sitting on a Leslie speaker , through which the organ was connected . Whenever McCartney played a certain note on the keyboard , the bottle began to vibrate , producing an eerie clattering sound that the Beatles decided to incorporate in their subsequent performances of the track . To compound the effect on the selected take , Starr played a fast snare drum roll and Harrison vocalised a prolonged , high @-@ pitched wail . While noting the \" palpable spiritual longing \" conveyed in the song , Chris Gerard of PopMatters describes this coda as a \" weird spectral ending , with Harrison wailing like a wounded ghost while the band members rattle their instruments ominously \" .",
  "Upminster formed an ancient parish of 3 @,@ 369 acres ( 1 @,@ 363 ha ) in the Chafford hundred of Essex . The parish vestry had meetings in the church until 1798 , when they moved to the Bell Inn . The parish was divided into North and South wards by the Hornchurch to Cranham road . In 1836 the vestry lost control of poor relief , with Upminster becoming part of the Romford Poor Law Union and in 1875 the parish became part of Romford rural sanitary district . Following the Local Government Act 1894 , the sanitary district became Romford Rural District and a parish council was formed of nine members , increasing to twelve by 1913 as the population had doubled . The parish council acquired the Clock House building on St Mary 's Lane for use as offices in 1924 . The parish formed part of the London Traffic Area from 1924 and the London Passenger Transport Area from 1933 . In 1934 the parish council was abolished and Upminster was combined with other parishes to form part of Hornchurch Urban District . In 1965 the urban district was abolished and its former area was combined with that of Municipal Borough of Romford ; and since then has formed part of the London Borough of Havering in Greater London .",
  "The main striking force of the Parthian army was its cataphracts , heavy cavalry with man and horse decked in mailed armor . The cataphracts were equipped with a lance for charging into enemy lines , but were not equipped with bows and arrows which were restricted to horse archers . Due to the cost of their equipment and armor , cataphracts were recruited from among the aristocratic class who , in return for their services , demanded a measure of autonomy at the local level from the Arsacid kings . The light cavalry was recruited from among the commoner class and acted as horse archers ; they wore a simple tunic and trousers into battle . They used composite bows and were able to shoot at enemies while riding and facing away from them ; this technique , known as the Parthian shot , was a highly effective tactic . The heavy and light cavalry of Parthia proved to be a decisive factor in the Battle of Carrhae where a Parthian force defeated a much larger Roman army under Crassus . Light infantry units , composed of levied commoners and mercenaries , were used to disperse enemy troops after cavalry charges .",
  "The breed is also known for its long periods of fertility and strong maternal instincts . Sows give birth to a large litter of 8 – 10 piglets , but some sows have been known to have litters of up to 13 piglets . Also of note is the Large Black sow listed in the Guinness Book of Records for having produced 26 litters between 1940 and 1952 – the largest number of litters ever recorded for a pig . Boars weigh 700 to 800 pounds ( 320 to 360 kg ) and sows around 600 to 700 pounds ( 270 to 320 kg ) , although obesity in sows sometimes results in cystic ovaries and a loss of fertility . The breed has become larger over the years ; in the early 1900s , weights averaged 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) for sows and larger for boars .",

  "Prior to any physical examination , the diagnosis of keratoconus frequently begins with an ophthalmologist 's or optometrist 's assessment of the person 's medical history , particularly the chief complaint and other visual symptoms , the presence of any history of ocular disease or injury which might affect vision , and the presence of any family history of ocular disease . An eye chart , such as a standard Snellen chart of progressively smaller letters , is then used to determine the person 's visual acuity . The eye examination may proceed to measurement of the localized curvature of the cornea with a manual keratometer , with detection of irregular astigmatism suggesting a possibility of keratoconus . Severe cases can exceed the instrument 's measuring ability .

  "The initial accretional heating together with continued decay of radioactive elements and likely tidal heating may have led to melting of the ice if an antifreeze like ammonia ( in the form of ammonia hydrate ) or some salt was present . The melting may have led to the separation of ice from rocks and formation of a rocky core surrounded by an icy mantle . A layer of liquid water ( ocean ) rich in dissolved ammonia may have formed at the core – mantle boundary . The eutectic temperature of this mixture is 176 K. The ocean , however , is likely to have frozen long ago . The freezing of the water likely led to the expansion of the interior , which may have been responsible for the formation of the canyons and obliteration of the ancient surface .

  "Purkinje cells form the heart of the cerebellar circuit , and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques . Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate even in the absence of the synaptic input . In awake , behaving animals , mean rates averaging around 40 Hz are typical . The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes . A simple spike is a single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10 ms ; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter @-@ spike intervals and declining amplitudes . Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes ( which occur at baseline rates around 1 Hz and never at rates much higher than 10 Hz ) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation , while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input . Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed .",

  "K 'ak ' Joplaj Chan K 'awiil was installed as the 14th dynastic ruler of Copán on 7 June 738 , 39 days after the execution of Uaxaclajuun Ub 'aah K 'awiil .

Copán 's defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city 's domain and the loss of the key Motagua River trade route to Quiriguá . The fall in Copán 's income and corresponding increase at Quiriguá is evident from the massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city , and Copán may even have been subject to its former vassal .

  "Between March 1926 and September 1928 , the CLR converted the remaining gate stock carriages in phases . The end platforms were enclosed to provide additional passenger accommodation and two sliding doors were inserting in each side . The conversions increased capacity and allowed the CLR to remove gatemen from the train crews , with responsibility for controlling doors moving to the two guards who each managed half the train . Finally , the introduction of driver / guard communications in 1928 allowed the CLR to dispense with the second guard , reducing a train crew to just a driver and a guard . The addition of doors in the sides of cars caused problems at Wood Lane where the length of the platform on the inside of the returning curve was limited by an adjacent access track into the depot . The problem was solved by the introduction of a pivoted section of platform which usually sat above the access track and allowed passengers to board trains as normal , but which could be moved to allow access to the depot .",

  "The last vestiges of the Stanley plan were swept aside by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1964 . The case involved the Prince Edward County public school system . Prince Edward County was one of the Southside counties . In 1951 , the NAACP filed suit on behalf of African American children in Prince Edward County demanding racial integration of the public schools . The U.S. Supreme Court consolidated the case , Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County , with Brown v.

  "In the 1970s , as the feminist movements were forming , they began to affect the literature surrounding women in China . Studies on Chinese women from this period were concerned with women ’ s liberation , and were sympathetic to the feminist movement . This sentiment largely influenced the topics and methodology of the research . With this shift in perspective , the focus of discourse remained on subordination , patriarchal oppression , and victimization . These studies examined such issues as foot binding and the chastity of widows . Literature formulated by feminist writers did nothing to dispel the myth of the weak , subservient woman . These works provided a new bias that had not before been articulated . Feminists believed that Chinese women were a part of a “ universally subordinated womanhood \" . This line of thinking illustrates the cultural superiority inherently felt by Western women . Writings on Chinese woman rarely account for differences in time , ethnicity , class , region or age , preferring to describe the status of women as a static , unitary fixture of Chinese culture , despite the political and geographic boundaries that defined different regions and the economic and social changes that occurred throughout history .",

  "Extraordinary events had recently transpired in England , with King Charles I executed , power in the hands of a commoner , and freedom of the pulpit given to Puritans . The commoner in power was a personal friend of Wheelwright , the Lord Protector , Oliver Cromwell , with whom Wheelwright had gone to college . Henry Vane , who had been very close to Wheelwright during the events of the Antinomian Controversy , had also reached high positions in government . These two prominent men had been working side by side for political and religious liberty , but became estranged and hostile towards each other in the early 1650s . Vane had retired from public life while Cromwell moved into the highest position of authority in England .

  "Upon activation , ERK may phosphorylate a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules that ultimately result in the protein synthesis and morphological changes observed in L @-@ LTP . These cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules may include transcription factors such as CREB . ERK @-@ mediated changes in transcription factor activity may trigger the synthesis of proteins that underlie the maintenance of L @-@ LTP . One such molecule may be protein kinase Mζ ( PKMζ ) , a persistently active kinase whose synthesis increases following LTP induction . PKMζ is an atypical isoform of PKC that lacks a regulatory subunit and thus remains constitutively active . Unlike other kinases that mediate LTP , PKMζ is active not just in the first 30 minutes following LTP induction ; rather , PKMζ becomes a requirement for LTP maintenance only during the late phase of LTP . PKMζ thus appears important for the persistence of memory and would be expected to be important in the maintenance of long @-@ term memory .

  "In a joint study of Tippett and Britten published in 1982 , Whittall designated the pair as \" the two best British composers of that ... generation born between 1900 and the outbreak of the First World War , and among the best of all composers born in the first two decades of the twentieth century \" . After Britten 's death in 1976 , Tippett became widely regarded as the doyen of British music , but critical opinion of his later works was not always positive . After the first performance of the Triple Concerto in 1980 , Driver wrote that \" not since The Knot Garden has [ he ] produced anything worthy of his early masterpieces \" . In 1982 , in his comparative study of Britten and Tippett , Whittall asserted that \" it would be difficult to claim that any of the works [ Tippett ] has begun in his seventies are the equal of earlier compositions \" . Although both Driver and Whittall later modified their opinions , such comments represented a general view among critics that Tippett 's creative powers had begun to decline after the triumph of King Priam . This perception was strongly expressed by Derek Puffett , who argued that the decline followed Tippett 's abandonment of myth — seen as the key to the success of The Midsummer Marriage and King Priam — and stemmed from his increasingly futile efforts to universalise his private agonies and express them musically . Despite his admiration for the early works , Puffett consigned Tippett \" to the ranks of those noble but tragic composers who have lived beyond their time \" . The critic Norman Lebrecht , writing in 2005 , dismissed almost all Tippett 's output , labelling him \" a composer to forget \" . With the forthcoming centenary celebrations in mind , Lebrecht wrote : \" I cannot begin to assess the damage to British music that will ensue from the coming year 's purblind promotion of a composer who failed so insistently to observe the rules of his craft \" . Against these criticisms Kemp maintained that while the style had become less immediately accessible , Tippett 's later works showed no loss of creative power . The critic Peter Wright , writing in 1999 , challenged the \" decline \" theory with the view that the later compositions are \" harder to come to terms with ... because of the more challenging nature of their musical language \" , a theme he developed in a detailed study of the Fifth String Quartet .",

The proximity of Allied forces had caused the majority of the city 's government officials to flee before the evacuation of its citizens was complete .

  "Following Greece , the headquarters of I Corps returned to Palestine . Wells was made General Staff Officer , 2nd Grade ( GSO2 ) , the deputy chief of staff in charge of planning operations . I Corps was alerted to take part in the Syria @-@ Lebanon Campaign , in spite of the fact that since Blamey had been promoted to Deputy Commander in Chief Middle East Command , the corps lacked a commanding officer . General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson — the British commander in Palestine and Transjordan — believed that I Corps ' loss of transport and signal equipment precluded it from participating in the campaign from the outset . Instead , Wilson attempted to exercise command from the King David Hotel . This proved to be a serious error , as his staff were preoccupied with political and administrative issues , and were too remote from the battlefields to exercise the close command required . Following a series of reverses , I Corps headquarters was sent for on 18 June , and Lieutenant General John Lavarack assumed command that day . The headquarters was confronted by a difficult situation , with almost all reserves committed . Lavarack began regrouping his force , concentrating the 7th Division for a decisive thrust towards Beirut . Hard fighting was required before the campaign was brought to a successful conclusion .",

  "Hershkovitz and Ray 's classification was never widely followed , and from 1976 on authors started to reinstate some of the other groups lumped in Oryzomys as separate genera .

In 2006 , Marcelo Weksler 's comprehensive phylogenetic analysis produced further evidence that the genus was polyphyletic , as species of Oryzomys were dispersed all over the oryzomyine tree . He proposed that eleven new genera should be created to accommodate those species that were not closely related to the type species of Oryzomys , the marsh rice rat ; he considered other options that would require fewer new genera , but argued that that would result in less meaningful genus @-@ level groups in Oryzomyini .

  "In December 1856 , Snowden wrote to Missouri Representative John S.

When the legislation , amended to include the weight and alloy the Mint had decided on , was debated in the House of Representatives on December 24 , it was opposed by Tennessee Congressman George Washington Jones over the legal tender provision ; Jones felt that under the Constitution , only gold and silver should be made legal tender . Phelps defended the bill on the ground that Congress had the constitutional power to regulate the value of money , but when the bill was brought back up to be considered on January 14 , 1857 , the legal tender provision had been removed .

  "Hill forts developed in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age , roughly the start of the first millennium BC . The reason for their emergence in Britain , and their purpose , has been a subject of debate . It has been argued that they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe , sites built by invaders , or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture . The dominant view since the 1960s has been that the increasing use of iron led to social changes in Britain . Deposits of iron ore were located in different places to the tin and copper ore necessary to make bronze , and as a result trading patterns shifted and the old elites lost their economic and social status . Power passed into the hands of a new group of people . Archaeologist Barry Cunliffe believes that population increase still played a role and has stated \" [ the forts ] provided defensive possibilities for the community at those times when the stress [ of an increasing population ] burst out into open warfare . But I wouldn 't see them as having been built because there was a state of war . They would be functional as defensive strongholds when there were tensions and undoubtedly some of them were attacked and destroyed , but this was not the only , or even the most significant , factor in their construction \" .",

  "Although several key elements of Evans 's designs — such as bucket elevators and Archimedean screws — were merely modified rather than invented by him , the combination of many machines into an automated and continuous production line was a unique idea that would prove pivotal to both the Industrial Revolution and the development of mass production . Scientific and technical historians now generally credit Evans as the first in a line of industrialists that culminated with Henry Ford and the modern assembly line . His concept of industrial automation was far ahead of its time , and the paradigm shift within manufacturing towards that concept would take more than a century to be fully realized . However continuous process manufacturing would spread from Evans 's milling designs , first to related industries such as brewing and baking , then eventually to a wide variety of products , as technology and prevailing opinion caught up . Evans contributions were later deemed to be so important that eminent industrial historian Sigfried Giedion would conclude that in this respect , Evans \" opens a new chapter in the history of mankind \" .",

In 1930 , two condom manufacturers sued each other in the Youngs Rubber case , and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise . He went further , and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing of condoms was not legally sound . Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932 , hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts . The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government , and Sanger 's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand . His decision overturned an important provision of the anti @-@ contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives . This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula . However , the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility , and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill @-@ informed sources until the 1960s .",

Late in 1939 General Van Voorst tot Voorst , reviving plans he had already worked out in 1937 , proposed to make use of the excellent defensive opportunities these rivers offered . He proposed a shift to a more mobile strategy by fighting a delaying battle at the plausible crossing sites near Arnhem and Gennep to force the German divisions to spend much of their offensive power before they had reached the MDL , and ideally even defeat them . This was deemed too risky by the Dutch government and General Reijnders . The latter wanted the army to first offer heavy resistance at the Grebbe Line and Peel Raam Position , and then fall back to the Fortress Holland .

Once the females begin to select males according to any particular characteristic , such as a long tail or a coloured crest , that characteristic is emphasized more and more in the males . Eventually all the males will have the characteristics that the females are sexually selecting for , as only those males can reproduce . This mechanism is powerful enough to create features that are strongly disadvantageous to the males in other ways . For example , some male birds of paradise have wing or tail streamers that are so long that they impede flight , while their brilliant colours may make the males more vulnerable to predators .

  "Offa of Mercia , who reigned from 757 to 796 , was the dominant force in Anglo @-@ Saxon England in the second half of the eighth century . The relationship between Offa and Cynewulf , who was king of Wessex from 757 to 786 , is not well documented , but it seems likely that Cynewulf maintained some independence from Mercian overlordship . Evidence of the relationship between kings can come from charters , which were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen , and which were witnessed by the kings who had power to grant the land . In some cases a king will appear on a charter as a subregulus , or \" subking \" , making it clear that he has an overlord . Cynewulf appears as \" King of the West Saxons \" on a charter of Offa 's in 772 ; and he was defeated by Offa in battle in 779 at Bensington , but there is nothing else to suggest Cynewulf was not his own master , and he is not known to have acknowledged Offa as overlord . Offa did have influence in the southeast of the country : a charter of 764 shows him in the company of Heahberht of Kent , suggesting that Offa 's influence helped place Heahberht on the throne . The extent of Offa 's control of Kent between 765 and 776 is a matter of debate amongst historians , but from 776 until about 784 it appears that the Kentish kings had substantial independence from Mercia .",

  "There is another type of day which , while not a festival , is considered to be equal with a festival . These days , called Days of Special Devotion , are Ash Wednesday and all the days of Holy Week , especially Good Friday . These particular days , like other festivals , automatically take precedence over any event on the calendar and sometimes even over other festivals . A good example of this would be in 2005 when Good Friday and the Annunciation fell on the same day ( March 25 ) . The Annunciation was transferred to March 28 , or the second day of Easter , to make room for Good Friday . The principle of the Church of Sweden is that the Annunciation is celebrated on the Sunday between 21 – 27 March ; although , should Good Friday or any other day of Holy Week , or Easter Sunday or Monday respectively , fall on 25 March , Annunciation is moved to the Sunday before Palm Sunday . ( For instance , in 2003 Annunciation was celebrated on 13 March ; 2008 ( when Easter Sunday was 23 March ) it was celebrated on the 9th . ) One unique feature of the ELCA calendar is that it has given congregations the options of two dates for the Transfiguration . Following most other Western Churches , the ELCA moved the Transfiguration from its August 6 date to the Last Sunday after Epiphany ( the Sunday immediately preceding Ash Wednesday ) as an option to the traditional Last Sunday after Epiphany in an effort to encourage a wider observance of the Transfiguration within congregations . However , the traditional date of August 6 was left on the calendar . Congregations were given the option of observing Transfiguration on the Last Sunday after the Epiphany and August 6 , thus leaving open the possibility that the Transfiguration could be commemorated twice within a calendar year . In Sweden , Transfiguration Day is celebrated on the seventh Sunday after Trinity Sunday , which is the eighth Sunday after Pentecost .",
  "Paratheria is an obsolete term for a taxonomic group including the xenarthran mammals ( sloths , anteaters , and armadillos ) and various groups thought to be related to them . It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths , anteaters , armadillos , and pangolins , usually classified as placentals , from both marsupial and placental mammals , an arrangement that received little support from other workers . When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s , they were thought to be related to xenarthrans , leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals . However , by the early 1990s , gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans , and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals .",

  "The four WindSeekers opened in 2011 are based on the same prototype design by Dutch amusement ride manufacturer Mondial Rides . The WindSeeker at Canada 's Wonderland was the first to be completed and thus the first to be tested . It was discovered during testing that the swings could rock back and forth once rotation reached full speed , and were close to hitting each other in some cases . Therefore , hydraulic dampers not included in the original design were added to all four WindSeekers to reduce this rocking . Nevertheless , there were still incidents : on June 14 , 2011 , the swings on Cedar Point 's WindSeeker began to sway in different directions , and some seats almost collided with each other . In one reported case , a rider had to extend his leg to stop the seat in front from hitting him . In another , a car collided with the kneecap of a rider who had closed their eyes . Official explanations suggested that the hydraulic dampers could fail under high winds : apparently , high winds and the imbalance arising when some swings are full and others not could cause the swings to collide . On June 29 , 2011 , Jennifer Valentyne of Breakfast Television Toronto rode the WindSeeker at Canada 's Wonderland for her \" Live @-@ Eye \" spot on the show . When the swings reached the top of the tower , the seats began swinging and hitting each other .

  "Relatively common , the Portuguese dogfish is an active hunter capable of tackling fast , large prey . It feeds mainly on cephalopods and fishes , though it also consumes invertebrates and cetacean carrion . This shark has acute vision optimized for detecting the bioluminescence of its prey , as sunlight does not reach the depths at which it lives . The Portuguese dogfish is aplacental viviparous , with the young provisioned by yolk and perhaps uterine fluid . The females give birth to up to 29 young after a gestation period of over one year . Valued for its liver oil and to a lesser extent meat , Portuguese dogfish are important to deepwater commercial fisheries operating off Portugal , the British Isles , Japan , and Australia .

  "On the basis of such assessments , researchers such as Cheryl Glenn , Professor at the Pennsylvania State University , argue that Aspasia seems to have been the only woman in classical Greece to have distinguished herself in the public sphere and must have influenced Pericles in the composition of his speeches . Some scholars believe that Aspasia opened an academy for young women of good families or even invented the Socratic method . However , Robert W. Wallace , Professor of classics at Northwestern University , underscores that \" we cannot accept as historical the joke that Aspasia taught Pericles how to speak and hence was a master rhetorician or philosopher \" . According to Wallace , the intellectual role Aspasia was given by Plato may have derived from comedy . Kagan describes Aspasia as \" a beautiful , independent , brilliantly witty young woman capable of holding her own in conversation with the best minds in Greece and of discussing and illuminating any kind of question with her husband \" . Roger Just , a classicist and Professor of social anthropology at the University of Kent , believes that Aspasia was an exceptional figure , but her example alone is enough to underline the fact that any woman who was to become the intellectual and social equal of a man would have to be a hetaera . According to Sr. Prudence Allen , a philosopher and seminary professor , Aspasia moved the potential of women to become philosophers one step forward from the poetic inspirations of Sappho .",
  "The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals . Only a few invertebrates such as sponges , jellyfish , adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain ; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead . The brain is located in the head , usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision , hearing , balance , taste , and smell . The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate 's body . In a typical human , the cerebral cortex ( the largest part ) is estimated to contain 15 – 33 billion neurons , each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons . These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons , which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells .",

  "According to author Thomas Telfer , by the turn of the 1970s , the town of Gateshead was suffering from \" the classic symptoms of decay in its inner @-@ city areas \" . The response during the 1960s had been a programme of systematic derelict land reclamation and environmental improvement . While these measures did not have an immediate positive impact on the perception of the town , Gateshead Council pressed ahead by looking to develop existing infrastructure with a view to overall regeneration . One such opportunity was identified at the Gateshead Youth Stadium , where the council believed that investment might raise the region 's profile and bring international recognition . In April 1974 , Gateshead Council inaugurated a \" Sport and Recreation \" department . In July 1974 , the council appointed Brendan Foster — a former schoolteacher turned athlete and a native of Tyne and Wear — as the Council 's sport and recreation manager . Foster , who according to Gibson became \" the father of Gateshead athletics \" , had been forced to train in Edinburgh during 1973 as a result of the poor condition of the Youth Stadium track . In December 1973 , he had been invited to a civic reception to celebrate his breaking of the two @-@ mile world record earlier that year at Crystal Palace . At this reception , Foster was told that a new synthetic track was being laid at Gateshead Youth Stadium . His response was a promise that , if the Council was serious , he would run at the stadium and break a world record ( Foster later offered an explanation of that promise : \" You know how it is when you 've had a few drinks — you promise the world ! \" ) . When the track was laid in early 1974 , Foster became convinced of the Council 's sincerity . He was interviewed for the managerial position and , upon appointment , became the \" driving force \" behind the programme of improvements to the Youth Stadium , which included the building of the main , covered Tyne and Wear stand in 1981 and three accompanying stands ; the venue was renamed the Gateshead International Stadium . This first tranche of improvements cost around £ 8 million , and Foster 's proposal to commemorate the re @-@ opening with an athletic event was approved , allowing for the first \" Gateshead Games \" to be held in 1974 .",

  "The Burnets moved to Terang in 1909 , when Frank was posted to be the bank manager there , having declined a post in London . Burnet was interested in the wildlife around the nearby lake ; he joined the Scouts in 1910 and enjoyed all outdoor activities . While living in Terang , he began to collect beetles and study biology . He read biology articles in the Chambers 's Encyclopaedia , which introduced him to the work of Charles Darwin . During his early teens , the family took annual holidays to Port Fairy , where Burnet spent his time observing and recording the behaviour of the wildlife . He was educated at Terang State School and attended Sunday school at the local church , where the priest encouraged him to pursue scholastic studies and awarded him a book on ants as a reward for his academic performance . He advised Frank to invest in Mac 's education and he won a full scholarship to board and study at Geelong College , one of Victoria 's most exclusive private schools . Starting there in 1913 , Burnet was the only boarder with a full scholarship . He did not enjoy his time there among the scions of the ruling upper class ; while most of his peers were brash and sports @-@ oriented , Burnet was bookish and not athletically inclined , and found his fellow students to be arrogant and boorish . During this period he kept his beetle @-@ collecting and disapproval of his peers a secret and mixed with his schoolmates out of necessity . Nevertheless , his academic prowess gained him privileges , and he graduated in 1916 , placing first in his school overall , and in history , English , chemistry and physics . The typical university path for a person of his social background was to pursue studies in theology , law or medicine . By this time , he was becoming disillusioned with religion and chose medicine . Due to World War I , military service was a possibility and he felt that a medical background would increase his chances of being given a non @-@ combat post .",
  "The horn shark captures prey via suction , created by expanding its buccal cavity . Its labial cartilages are modified so that the mouth can form a tube , facilitating the suction force . Once the prey is drawn into the mouth , it is secured with the sharp front teeth and then ground into pieces by the flat lateral teeth . To extract buried or affixed prey , the horn shark grips it and adopts a vertical posture with the head and pectoral fins against the substrate and the tail arched above . The shark then acts as a lever with its pectoral fins as the fulcrum : with a downward stroke of the tail , it forces its head upwards and pulls the prey loose ; this mode of feeding has not been observed in any other shark . The horn shark is also capable of protruding its upper jaw up to 15 % the length of its head ; this motion takes only 20 milliseconds to accomplish and allows the shark to use its upper jaw like a chisel to dislodge firmly attached prey .",

  "Signalling systems are shaped by mutual interests between signallers and receivers . An alert bird such as a Eurasian jay warning off a stalking predator is communicating something useful to the predator : that it has been detected by the prey ; it might as well quit wasting its time stalking this alerted prey , which it is unlikely to catch . When the predator gives up , the signaller can get back to other tasks such as feeding .

  "The trend was hastened by the regular ice famines during the period , such as the 1898 British famine , which typically caused rapid price increases , fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in the new technologies . Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice . Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. as early as the 1870s . The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and safer than American sourced ice , but reports in 1904 noted the risk of contamination in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice . In 1907 , New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs ; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry , but public opinion was turning against natural ice on safety grounds .

For example , the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form , with poetic imagery and allusions , discussing aesthetic topics such as music , seduction , drama , and beauty .

The views of the book are not neatly summarized , but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors .

  "The Assembly was called by the Long Parliament before and during the beginning of the First English Civil War . The Long Parliament was influenced by Puritanism , a religious movement which sought to further reform the church . They were opposed to the religious policies of King Charles I and William Laud , Archbishop of Canterbury . As part of a military alliance with Scotland , Parliament agreed that the outcome of the Assembly would bring the English Church into closer conformity with the Church of Scotland . The Scottish Church was governed by a system of elected assemblies of elders called presbyterianism , rather than rule by bishops , called episcopalianism , which was used in the English church . Scottish commissioners attended and advised the Assembly as part of the agreement . Disagreements over church government caused open division in the Assembly , despite attempts to maintain unity . The party of divines who favoured presbyterianism was in the majority , but political and military realities led to greater influence for the congregationalist party . Congregationalists favoured autonomy for individual congregations rather than the subjection of congregations to regional and national assemblies entailed in presbyterianism . Parliament eventually adopted a presbyterian form of government , but it lacked the power the presbyterian divines desired . During the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 , all of the documents of the Assembly were repudiated and episcopal church government was reinstated in England .",

  "Hepatitis B virus DNA persists in the body after infection , and in some people the disease recurs .

Immunosuppressive drugs favor increased HBV replication while inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function in the liver . The risk of reactivation varies depending on the serological profile ; those with detectable HBsAg in their blood are at the greatest risk , but those with only antibodies to the core antigen are also at risk . The presence of antibodies to the surface antigen , which are considered to be a marker of immunity , does not preclude reactivation .

  "Early in the New Year , the establishment of the battalion 's command formation was completed with the appointment of subalterns as platoon commanders , following their return from their first appointment courses . The training continuum evolved with the establishment of an NCO school and various specialist courses , including range finding and transport ; a bugle and drum band was also raised . In February 1941 , training focused upon skill @-@ at @-@ arms , before undertaking a 60 @-@ mile ( 97 km ) march from Northam to Perth , which was conducted over the course of three days and was undertaken , according to the Australian War Memorial , to test the \" physical fitness and endurance of the personnel and officers \" and \" the efficiency of the battalion 's motor transport and administration personnel \" . Upon their return , training progressed to field firing , night manoeuvres , portage , defensive exercises and further specialised training , continuing until July , by which time the battalion was considered ready for deployment . That month it received orders to move to Adelaide , South Australia . Proceeding in four drafts — one each on the transports Katoomba and Duntroon and two by rail — they were established at Woodside , in the Adelaide Hills , by the end of the month . The battalion endured a bitter winter , conducting field exercises amidst the steep wooded slopes of the Mount Lofty Range ; these became more tactically complex and physically demanding as Anketell worked the battalion up to a peak of efficiency , in preparation for deployment amidst growing tensions in the Pacific .",

  "Bulgarian folk music is by far the most extensive traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Eastern and Western influences . It contains Far Eastern , Oriental , medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities and modes . The music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments , such as gadulka , gaida ( bagpipe ) , kaval and tupan . One of its most distinguishing features is extended rhythmical time , which has no equivalent in the rest of European music . The State Television Female Vocal Choir is the most famous performing folk ensemble , and received a Grammy Award in 1990 . Bulgaria 's written musical composition can be traced back to the early Middle Ages and the works of Yoan Kukuzel ( c . 1280 – 1360 ) . Classical music , opera and ballet are represented by composers Emanuil Manolov , Pancho Vladigerov and Georgi Atanasov and singers Ghena Dimitrova , Boris Hristov and Nikolay Gyaurov . Bulgarian performers have gained popularity in several other genres like progressive rock ( FSB ) , electropop ( Mira Aroyo ) and jazz ( Milcho Leviev ) .",
  "The party scenes at Jesse 's house sought to illustrate Jesse 's internal guilt and self @-@ hatred for having murdered Gale Boetticher in the third season finale , \" Full Measure \" . Gilligan said these scenes were written because he wanted to demonstrate that the actions of the characters in Breaking Bad have major consequences . The writing staff spent weeks discussing how Jesse would react to having killed Gale , and went with the course of events in \" Thirty @-@ Eight Snub \" in part because they felt it would be the most unexpected for the audience . Bryan Cranston praised these scenes , saying \" I thought it was a great way to show a person going through a private hell . That everybody suffers , deals with their own personal loss in many different ways . \" The scenes were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin . Although scenes in Jesse 's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house , these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy . Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for both the party and Jesse 's state of mind , using variations of punk rock , hip hop and dubstep . During one scene when Jesse , Skinny Pete and Badger are snorting meth together , Badger leans down outside of the shot to take the drugs , then Skinny Pete pops back up in a match cut .

  "In women , acne can be improved with the use of any combined oral contraceptive . Oral contraceptives decrease the ovaries ' production of androgen hormones , resulting in lower skin production of sebum , and consequently improve acne severity . The combinations which contain third- or fourth @-@ generation progestins such as desogestrel , drospirenone , or norgestimate may theoretically be more beneficial . A 2014 systematic review and meta @-@ analysis found that oral antibiotics appear to be somewhat more effective than oral contraceptives at decreasing the number of inflammatory acne lesions at three months . However , the two therapies are approximately equal in efficacy at six months for decreasing the number of inflammatory , non @-@ inflammatory , and total acne lesions . The authors of the analysis suggested that oral contraceptives may be a preferred first @-@ line acne treatment over oral antibiotics in certain women due to similar efficacy at six months and a lack of associated antibiotic resistance .",
  "In the late 1830s Ripley became increasingly engaged in \" Associationism \" , an early socialist movement based on the work of Charles Fourier . Horace Greeley , a New York newspaper editor , and others began to pressure the Brook Farm experiment to follow more closely the pattern of Charles Fourier at a time when the community was struggling to be self @-@ sufficient .

  "With the increase of tea 's use in Chinese herbology , production methods changed , where the processed green tea leaves were not immediately dried after steaming . Rather the steamed tea leaves were first pulverized into a paste form , with the paste then formed in moulds and slowly dried into brick tea , a technique well described by Lu Yu in his work The Classic of Tea . Tender leaves and leaf buds were generally not used , as older mature tea leaves were preferred for tea production . Some tea bricks were also produced from mature whole leaves , which typically required the use of a cooked rice slurry ( 米湯 ) to bind the tea brick together . The preference of producing tea in brick form possibly stems from the fact that it can be more easily transported and stored .",

  "The settlement was expanded by the construction of trenches bordering a second adjoining space to the northeast with two additional access points named Ampanidinamporona and Ambavahaditsiombiomby , the latter a natural gateway formed by two boulders . This latter entrance was most likely used to access the space even before the formal establishment of a royal city there , and is therefore considered by archaeologists to be the oldest gateway at the site . After the establishment of the rova , this entrance was reserved for use by the sovereign , a reflection of the spiritual significance of the northeastern direction and its association with the ancestors , whose benediction and hasina provided the basis for the sovereign 's power and legitimacy . It was also used to bring sacrificial cattle into the compound . Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana then expanded toward the west to a series of natural defenses , including stony cliffs and steep forested slopes that obviated the need to dig defensive trenches , and he constructed several additional gates that he named Ambavahadimahazaza , Andranomboahangy and Ambavahadiantandranomasina . Andrianampoinimerina expanded the trenches around the city using fanampoana labor . During his reign , a trench was dug that entirely encircles the hill , and a series of trenches was dug alongside existing ones to further protect the city against enemies . The current defensive wall was reconstructed around 1830 during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I. An estimated sixteen million egg whites were mixed with lime to produce the whitewash for the compound 's exterior and interior walls . Until French colonization in 1897 and at least as early as the reign of Radama I , foreigners and non @-@ residents were not allowed to enter the royal city without authorization from the sovereign .",

  "Atmospheric lift caused by low @-@ level wind convergence into the surface low brings clouds and potentially precipitation . The low @-@ pressure area 's cloudy skies act to minimize diurnal temperature extremes . Since clouds reflect sunlight , incoming shortwave solar radiation is less , which causes lower temperatures during the day .

  "A tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa on July 8 and crossed the Atlantic without much development . In the Caribbean , showers increased , but wind shear prevented development . The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific on July 16 , and wind shear decreased to allow the convection to organize . Tropical Depression Five @-@ E developed on July 20 about 395 miles ( 636 km ) south of Manzanillo , Mexico . At that time , gradual strengthening was anticipated . The depression quickly intensified into Tropical Storm Douglas . Around that time , most of the deep convection was situated south of the atmospheric circulation . Initially expected to become a hurricane only briefly , late on July 21 , the NHC reported that Douglas had become a hurricane . Upon becoming a hurricane , Douglas was situated in low wind shear environment ; however , Hurricane Douglas was expected to reach cold waters in 36 hours , and thus was not predicted to become a major hurricane . Douglas became a Category 2 hurricane on July 22 , reaching peak winds of 105 miles per hour ( 170 km / h ) . Douglas held this intensity for 18 hours as it traveled westward . When Douglas weakened from its peak intensity , it had an organized cloud pattern , but the thunderstorm activity was weakening , typical of most Pacific hurricanes that reach cooler waters . The weakening briefly stopped after Douglas went through an eyewall replacement cycle , but Douglas was downgraded to a tropical storm late on July 24 as the storm only had a small area of deep convection left . Tropical storm Douglas briefly stopped weakening as convection increased , only to fade away again hours later . The storm was downgraded to a tropical depression early on July 26 , and later that day degenerated into a remnant low pressure area . The remnant low dissipated the next day .",

  "The region has a subtropical climate . Under the Köppen climate classification , western parts have a semi @-@ arid climate ( Bs ) while the east has a humid subtropical climate ( Cfa ) . Chaco is one of the few natural regions in the world located between tropical and temperate latitudes that is not a desert . Precipitation and temperature are relatively homogeneous throughout the region . The general atmospheric circulation influences the climate of the region , primarily by two permanent high pressure systems - the South Pacific High and the South Atlantic High - and a low pressure system that develops over northeast Argentina called the Chaco Low . The interaction between the South Atlantic High and the Chaco Low generates a pressure gradient that brings moist air from the east and northeast to eastern coastal and central regions of Argentina . In summer , this interaction strengthens , favouring the development of convective thunderstorms that can result in heavy rainfall . In contrast , winters are dry due to these systems weakening , and the lower insolation that weakens the Chaco Low , and the northward displacement of westerly winds . During the entire year , the South Pacific High influences the climate by bringing cold , moist air masses originating in Patagonia leading to cold temperatures and frost , particularly during winter . Summers feature more stable weather than winter since the South Atlantic and South Pacific highs are at their southernmost positions , making the entrance of cold fronts more difficult .",

  "Carey 's performance was recorded on March 16 , 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens , New York . The show featured a number of musicians , back @-@ up vocalists and just a crew of ten , for filming and recording . Directed by Larry Jordan , who previously worked with Carey on the music video for \" Someday \" . Dana Jon Chapelle was chosen as the sound mixer , having worked with Carey on her previous two studio albums . The show began with the song \" Emotions \" Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots . Prior to the song 's studio introduction , Carey opened the song with an impromptu gospel and a cappella number , eventually leading to the song 's chorus led by David Cole . After the song , Carey introduced the band and staff ; to her left was a four @-@ piece string section with Belinda Whitney Barnett , Cecilia Hobbs @-@ Gardner , Wince Garvey and Laura Corcos , while San Shea played the harpsichord and harmonium . The show 's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the drums , Randy Jackson on bass , Vernon Black on guitar , and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce , both percussionists . Additionally , Carey had ten background singers on stage , led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan . The next song on the set @-@ list was \" If It 's Over \" , a collaboration with Carole King . Walter Afanasieff replaced Cole on the piano , during which time a set of five male musicians were brought on stage . They were Lew Delgado , baritone saxophone ; Lenny Pickett , tenor saxophone ; George Young , alto saxophone ; Earl Gardner , trumpet ; and Steve Turre , trombone . They had been present during Carey 's live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live a few months prior . As Carey introduced the song , she said \" this next song I wrote with one of my idols , Carole King \" , beginning the performance shortly after . For \" Someday \" , Cole returned to the stage , replacing Afanasieff on the keyboard . During the song , Carey would often place her index finger over her left ear , especially while using the whistle register . She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely , something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note . Once again , as Carey began \" Vision of Love \" , her \" first single ever \" , Afansieff swapped positions with Cole . The performance varied heavily from the studio version , as it was more low key and only used voices in a cappella form , without any heavy instrumentation . Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set @-@ list , \" Make It Happen \" , Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole , playing the bass while the latter handled the treble . After the song began , the back @-@ up began \" piling their vocals \" over Carey 's , according to author Chris Nickson , and allowed the song to attain a more \" churchy feel \" . He felt the song was superior to the studio version , due to its stripped performance and vocals :",

The meaning of the Hungarian loanword was expanded to guards in general , including law enforcement officers . The word was likely ultimately derived from medieval Latin banderius or bannerius , meaning either a guardian of fields or summoner , or follower of a banner .",
  "Since allowing the trustee of the will to retain the property is at the heart of the \" fraud \" , it is not clear why courts have considered the appropriate remedy to recognise a trust on behalf of others , rather than a resulting trust in favour of the estate ( the residuary legatee ) . To this it has been argued that , since the testator is dead , a resulting trust is often fatal to the beneficiary 's claims since the testator is not in a position to attempt again . Having admitted external evidence to establish the trust exists , any claim that the formality requirement is further weakened by enforcing the trust is not strong . A resulting trust would be a result not party intended . The enforcement of the secret trust as a response to perceived fraud also opens the door to a further form of deceit , whereby the trustee funnels the trust monies to the wrong beneficiary . If considered significant , this might , however , be countered with a higher evidential burden when establishing the identity of the secret beneficiary .",

  "Visible on the inside of most empty bivalve valves is a shiny curved line that runs more or less parallel to the outer margin of the shell and often connects the two adductor muscle scars ( if the animal had two adductor muscles ) . This line ( known as the pallial line ) exists because , parallel to the opening edge of the bivalve 's shell , the mantle is attached to the shell by a continuous narrow row of minute mantle retractor muscles . The function of these small muscles is to pull the loose edge of the mantle up out of harm 's way when this is necessary because of minor predation attempts . In many bivalves , the mantle edges fuse at the posterior end of the shell to form two siphons , through one of which water is inhaled , and the other expelled , for respiration and suspension feeding . Often , a pocket @-@ like space occurs into which the siphons fit when they are retracted . This is visible on the inside of the valve as an indentation on the pallial line which is known as the pallial sinus .",
  "Szent István was hit by two 45 @-@ centimetre ( 18 in ) torpedoes abreast her boiler rooms . The aft boiler room quickly flooded and gave the ship a 10 ° list to starboard . Counterflooding of the portside trim cells and magazines reduced the list to 7 ° , but efforts to use collision mats to plug the holes failed . While this was going on the dreadnought steered for the nearby Bay of Brgulje at low speed . However , water continued to leak into the forward boiler room and eventually doused all but the two boilers on the port side . This killed the power for the pumps and only left enough electricity to run the lights . The turrets were trained to port in a futile effort to counter the list and their ready ammunition was thrown overboard . An attempt by Tegetthoff to take the crippled battleship into tow was also abandoned after it became clear that Szent István was doomed . Flooding continued , and the ship capsized at 6 : 05 am off Premuda Island . Only 89 sailors died — 41 from Hungary — the low death toll partly attributed to the fact that all sailors with the KuK Navy had to learn to swim before entering active service .",

The film was largely a remake of Buster Keaton 's Spite Marriage ; Keaton , who had become a comedy consultant to MGM after his film career had diminished , began coaching Skelton on set during the filming . Keaton worked in this capacity on several of Skelton 's films , and his 1926 film The General was also later rewritten to become Skelton 's A Southern Yankee ( 1948 ) , under directors S.

The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable , as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato , and Obito takes up Madara 's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan . After meeting with Hagoromo , Sasuke , who is the current reincarnation of Indra , awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye , which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern , making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance . His Rinnegan allows him to perform Amenotejikara ( 天手力 , lit . \" Heavenly Hand Power \" ) , which can shift himself , others , and objects a set distance away from his original location . He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space . Due to its speed , this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range . While there is no prerequisite for using the technique , it does have a recharging period after each use . Once fully mastered it can even cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time .",
  "In February 1831 rebels took the cities of Parma , Modena and Bologna and appealed to France for help . Their former masters appealed for help from Austria , but Metternich was anxious not to march Austrian troops into the Papal States without authorisation from the new Pope Gregory XVI . He occupied Parma and Modena , however , and eventually did cross into Papal territory . As a result , Italy was pacified by the end of March . He authorised troop withdrawal from the Papal States in July , but by January 1832 they were back to put down a second rebellion . By now Metternich was ageing noticeably : his hair was grey and his face drawn and sunken , although his wife still enjoyed his company . In February 1832 a daughter , also Melanie , was born ; in 1833 a son , Klemens , though he died aged two months ; in October 1834 a second son , Paul ; and in 1837 his third with Melanie , Lothar . Politically , Metternich had a new adversary , Lord Palmerston , who had taken over at the British Foreign Office in 1830 . By the end of 1832 they had clashed on virtually every issue . \" In short , \" Metternich wrote , \" Palmerston is wrong about everything \" . Mostly , Metternich was annoyed by his insistence that under the 1815 agreements Britain had the right to oppose Austria 's tightening of university controls in Germany , as Metternich had done again in 1832 . Mtternich also worried that if future congresses were held in Britain , as Palmerston wanted , his own influence would be significantly reduced .",

  "One of the primary historiographical questions surrounding Richard concerns his political agenda and the reasons for its failure . His kingship was thought to contain elements of the early modern absolute monarchy as exemplified by the Tudor dynasty . More recently , Richard 's concept of kingship has been seen by some as not so different from that of his antecedents , and that it was exactly by staying within the framework of traditional monarchy that he was able to achieve as much as he did . Yet his actions were too extreme , and too abrupt . For one , the absence of war was meant to reduce the burden of taxation , and so help Richard 's popularity with the Commons in parliament . However , this promise was never fulfilled , as the cost of the royal retinue , the opulence of court and Richard 's lavish patronage of his favourites proved as expensive as war had been , without offering commensurate benefits . As for his policy of military retaining , this was later emulated by Edward IV and Henry VII , but Richard 's exclusive reliance on the county of Cheshire hurt his support from the rest of the country . As Simon Walker concludes : \" What he sought was , in contemporary terms , neither unjustified nor unattainable ; it was the manner of his seeking that betrayed him . \"",

  "The casualties for both sides were heavy . The battle resulted in the French invasion of the Isle of Wight being stopped . Another skirmish took place at Bonchurch several days after the battle , when English forces engaged with French men who had disembarked from French ships retreating from Portsmouth looking for water . A senior French commander , Chevalier D 'Aux , was killed as a result of the engagement . The English victory at Bonchurch only had a marginal impact on the course of the Italian War of 1542 @-@ 1546 , because the battle only involved a very small number of men relative to the numbers of men that were engaged throughout the entirety of the war . The fact that it only had a marginal impact is also because , if the French had captured the Isle of Wight , it is unlikely that that capture would have drastically affected the course of the war , because there were more significant territories that were being contested . The Isle of Wight could have been used to support French operations against England had it been captured ; Claude d 'Annebault , commander of the French armada , recorded that “ having it [ the Isle of Wight ] under our control , we [ the French ] could then dominate Portsmouth ... and so put the enemy to extraordinary expense in maintaining a standing army and navy to contain us . ” Although some sources do state that the victory at Bonchurch was responsible for the French withdrawal from the Isle of Wight , the source of information which states that the French won the battle says that fighting at Bembridge was what drove the French from the island .",

The examination of burial sites for this period like that at Hallowhill , St Andrews indicate a life expectancy of only 26 @-@ 9 . The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high fertility , high mortality society , similar to many developing countries in the modern world , with a relatively young demographic profile , and perhaps early childbearing , and large numbers of children for women . This would have meant that there were a relatively small proportion of available workers to the number of mouths to feed . This have made it difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and more complex societies to develop . From the formation of the Kingdom of Alba in the tenth century , to before the Black Death reached the country in 1349 , estimates based on the amount of farmable land , suggest that population may have grown from half a million to a million . Although there is no reliable documentation on the impact of the plague , there are many anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades . If the pattern followed that in England , then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million by the end of the fifteenth century . Compared with the situation after the redistribution of population in the later clearances and the industrial revolution , these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom , with roughly half living north of the Tay .

  "Since the rings of Uranus appear to be young , they must be continuously renewed by the collisional fragmentation of larger bodies . The estimates show that the lifetime against collisional disruption of a moon with the size like that of Puck is a few billion years . The lifetime of a smaller satellite is much shorter . Therefore , all current inner moons and rings can be products of disruption of several Puck @-@ sized satellites during the last four and half billion years . Every such disruption would have started a collisional cascade that quickly ground almost all large bodies into much smaller particles , including dust . Eventually the majority of mass was lost , and particles survived only in positions that were stabilized by mutual resonances and shepherding . The end product of such a disruptive evolution would be a system of narrow rings . However , a few moonlets must still be embedded within the rings at present .

At the time , only personnel from the regular British military could be awarded the VC and thus Heaphy , as a militiaman , was not eligible .

  "Gryposaurus is based on specimen NMC 2278 , a skull and partial skeleton collected in 1913 by George F. Sternberg from what is now known as the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta , along the Red Deer River . This specimen was described and named by Lawrence Lambe shortly thereafter , Lambe drawing attention to its unusual nasal crest . A few years earlier , Barnum Brown had collected and described a partial skull from New Mexico , which he named Kritosaurus . This skull was missing the snout , which had eroded into fragments ; Brown restored it after the duckbill now known as Anatotitan , which was flat @-@ headed , and believed that some unusual pieces were evidence of compression . Lambe 's description of Gryposaurus provided evidence of a different type of skull configuration , and by 1916 the Kritosaurus skull had been redone with a nasal arch and both Brown and Charles Gilmore had proposed that Gryposaurus and Kritosaurus were one and the same . This idea was reflected in William Parks 's naming of a nearly complete skeleton from the Dinosaur Park Formation as Kritosaurus incurvimanus , not Gryposaurus incurvimanus ( although he left Gryposaurus notabilis in its own genus ) . Direct comparison between Kritosaurus incurvimanus and Gryposaurus notabilis is hindered by the fact that the incurvimanus type specimen is missing the front part of the skull , so the full shape of the nasal arch cannot be seen . The 1942 publication of the influential Lull and Wright monograph on hadrosaurs sealed the Kritosaurus / Gryposaurus question for nearly fifty years in favor of Kritosaurus . Reviews beginning in the 1990s , however , called into question the identity of Kritosaurus navajovius , which has limited material for comparison with other duckbills . Thus , Gryposaurus has once again been separated , at least temporarily , from Kritosaurus .",

Many thought that the script was only used for sacred and ritual functions , and that as such it was unlikely to be decipherable since it was tied to esoteric and philosophical ideas , and did not record historical information .

  "In his 2001 catalogue raisonné , Slive attributes 694 paintings to Ruisdael and lists another 163 paintings with dubious or , he believes , incorrect attribution . There are three main reasons why there is uncertainty over whose hand painted various Ruisdael @-@ style landscapes . Firstly , four members of the Ruysdael family were landscapists with similar signatures , some of which were later fraudulently altered into Jacob 's . This is further complicated by the fact that Ruisdael used variations of his signature . This typically reads \" JvRuisdael \" or the monogram \" JVR \" , sometimes using a small italic ' s ' and sometimes a Gothic long ' s ' , such as on Landscape with Waterfall . Secondly , many 17th century landscape paintings are unsigned and could be from pupils or copyists . Finally , fraudsters imitated Ruisdaels for financial gain , with the earliest case reported by Houbraken in 1718 : a certain Jan Griffier the Elder could imitate Ruisdael 's style so well that he often sold them for real Ruisdaels , especially with figurines added in the style of the artist Wouwerman .

  "The forest cobra is one of the least frequent causes of snake bite among the African cobras , largely due its forest @-@ dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja ( True Cobra ) species . The symptomology is thought to be very similar to that of the Egyptian cobra ( Naja haje ) . Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse , and few recorded bites have been documented . Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported , but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted . Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen ; however , neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality . If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated , it can quickly attack the aggressor , and because a large amount of venom is injected , a rapidly fatal outcome is possible . The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high . The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom .

In 1633 he added a \" d \" , and maintained this form consistently from then on , proving that this minor change had a meaning for him ( whatever it might have been ) . This change is purely visual ; it does not change the way his name is pronounced . Curiously enough , despite the large number of paintings and etchings signed with this modified first name , most of their documents that mentioned him during his lifetime retained the original \" Rembrant \" spelling . ( Note : the rough chronology of signature forms above applies to the paintings , and to a lesser degree to the etchings ; from 1632 , presumably , there is only one etching signed \" RHL @-@ v. Rijn , \" the large @-@ format \" Raising of Lazarus , \" B 73 ) . His practice of signing his work with his first name , later followed by Vincent van Gogh , was probably inspired by Raphael , Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo who , then as now , were referred to by their first names alone .",
  "Enforcement of the HOS rules is generally handled by DOT officers of their respective states , although any ordinary police officer may inspect a driver 's log book .

  "Hydrogen was liquefied for the first time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and his invention , the vacuum flask . He produced solid hydrogen the next year . Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey , and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford , Mark Oliphant , and Paul Harteck . Heavy water , which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen , was discovered by Urey 's group in 1932 . François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine , an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806 .

  "The chick fledges between two and nine months after hatching , almost twice as long as a gull of the same body mass . The reasons behind the length of time are associated with the distance from the breeding site to food . First , there are few predators at the nesting colonies , therefore there is no pressure to fledge quickly . Second , the time between feedings is long due to the distance from the nest site that adults forage , thus a chick that had a higher growth rate would stand a better chance of starving to death . The duration between feedings vary among species and during the stages of development . Small feeds are frequent during the guard phase , but afterward become less frequent . However , each feed can deliver a large amount of energy ; both sooty shearwater and mottled petrel chicks have been recorded to double their weight in a single night , probably when fed by both parents .",

  "One hundred measures into the solo exposition , which is now in the relative major of E @-@ flat , the piano plays a cadential trill , leading the orchestra from the dominant seventh to the tonic . This suggests to the listener that the solo exposition has reached an end , but Mozart instead gives the woodwinds a new theme . The exposition continues for another 60 or so measures , before another cadential trill brings about the real conclusion , prompting a ritornello that connects the exposition with the development . The pianist and musicologist Charles Rosen argues that Mozart thus created a \" double exposition \" . Rosen also suggests that this explains why Mozart made substantial elongations to the orchestral exposition during the composition process ; he needed a longer orchestral exposition to balance its \" double \" solo counterpart .",
