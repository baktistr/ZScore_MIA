  "Analysis of the jaw design of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues ( 1998 , 2004 , 2009 ) suggests that the animal was capable of quick bites , but not strong ones . Quick bites are more important than strong bites when capturing small prey , as shown by studies of modern @-@ day crocodiles . Furthermore , these researchers noted a high degree of flexibility ( kinesis ) within the skull and especially the lower jaw , somewhat similar to modern snakes . Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole . In addition , the front part of the lower jaw was hinged , and thus able to move up and down . When pressed downwards , the teeth would have projected forward , allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items ; when the teeth were curved upwards , the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping . Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items . Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey , but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs .",

  "Fruitbodies of Stropharia caerulea form mycelial cords – rootlike structures consisting of a dense mass of hyphae – which create extensive underground networks that move nutrients and allow the fungus to \" forage \" for resources . These cords are often associated with stems and rhizomes of the common nettle ( Urtica dioica ) . These mycelial systems ' development and the species 's interactions with other cord @-@ forming wood decomposer basidiomycetes have been investigated . The mycelia of Stropharia caerulea form a fractal structure characterized by a dense , relatively slowly extending front , a formation associated with finding relatively homogeneously distributed nutrients – equivalent to short @-@ range foraging . An increase in the supply of soil nitrogen or phosphorus increases the fractal branching of the mycelia , allowing increased uptake of nutrients .",

  "The narrative elements of the ceiling illustrate that God made the World as a perfect creation and put humanity into it , that humanity fell into disgrace and was punished by death and by separation from God . Humanity then sank further into sin and disgrace , and was punished by the Great Flood . Through a lineage of Ancestors – from Abraham to Joseph – God sent the saviour of humanity , Christ Jesus . The coming of the Saviour was prophesied by Prophets of Israel and Sibyls of the Classical world . The various components of the ceiling are linked to this Christian doctrine . Traditionally , the Old Testament was perceived as a prefiguring of the New Testament . Many incidents and characters of the Old Testament were commonly understood as having a direct symbolic link to some particular aspect of the life of Jesus or to an important element of Christian doctrine or to a sacrament such as Baptism or the Eucharist . Jonah , for example , was readily recognisable by his attribute of the large fish and was commonly seen to symbolise Jesus ' death and resurrection .",

  "Within attachment theory , attachment means \" a biological instinct in which proximity to an attachment figure is sought when the child senses or perceives threat or discomfort . Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort \" . Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults , but between a child and a caregiver these bonds are based on the child 's need for safety , security and protection , paramount in infancy and childhood . John Bowlby begins by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways , ranging from primitive reflex @-@ like \" fixed action patterns \" to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components . In the most complex organisms , instinctive behaviors may be \" goal @-@ corrected \" with continual on @-@ course adjustments ( such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey ) . The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies ( Miller , Galanter , and Pribram , 1960 ) thus came to replace Freud 's concept of drive and instinct . Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate , but — depending on the organism — can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances , provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism 's environment of evolutionary adaptedness . Such flexible organisms pay a price , however , because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development . For humans , Bowlby speculates , the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present @-@ day hunter @-@ gatherer societies for the purpose of survival , and , ultimately , genetic replication . Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships , nor is it synonymous with love and affection , although these may indicate that bonds exist . Some infants direct attachment behaviour ( proximity seeking ) toward more than one attachment figure almost as soon as they start to show discrimination between caregivers ; most come to do so during their second year . These figures are arranged hierarchically , with the principal attachment figure at the top . The set @-@ goal of the attachment behavioural system is to maintain the accessibility and availability of the attachment figure . \" Alarm \" is the term used for activation of the attachment behavioural system caused by fear of danger . \" Anxiety \" is the anticipation or fear of being cut off from the attachment figure . If the figure is unavailable or unresponsive , separation distress occurs . In infants , physical separation can cause anxiety and anger , followed by sadness and despair . By age three or four , physical separation is no longer such a threat to the child 's bond with the attachment figure . Threats to security in older children and adults arise from prolonged absence , breakdowns in communication , emotional unavailability , or signs of rejection or abandonment .",

  "Transformation ( the transfer of DNA from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium ) appears to be part of an adaptation for DNA repair . H. pylori is naturally competent for transformation . While many organisms are competent only under certain environmental conditions , such as starvation , H. pylori is competent throughout logarithmic growth . All organisms encode genetic programs for response to stressful conditions including those that cause DNA damage . In H. pylori , homologous recombination is required for repairing DNA double @-@ strand breaks ( DSBs ) . The AddAB helicase @-@ nuclease complex resects DSBs and loads RecA onto single @-@ strand DNA ( ssDNA ) , which then mediates strand exchange , leading to homologous recombination and repair .

  "In August 1942 , during the Partisan Long March west through the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , NDH ) , Josip Broz Tito 's Yugoslav Partisans captured a group of eight Germans from the civil and military engineering group Organisation Todt near Livno . The leader of the captured group was a mining engineer , Hans Ott , who was also an officer of the Abwehr , the Wehrmacht 's intelligence organisation . The captured group had been identifying new sources of metal and timber for the Germans , but Ott had also been tasked by the Abwehr with making contact with the Partisans . Following their capture , Ott told his captors that he had an important message to deliver to Partisan headquarters , and after he had been taken there he suggested to the Partisans that his group be exchanged for Partisans held by the Germans in jails in Zagreb . On that basis , Ott was sent to Zagreb on parole , where he met with the German Plenipotentiary General in Croatia , General der Infanterie ( Lieutenant General ) Edmund Glaise @-@ Horstenau . He advised Glaise @-@ Horstenau that Tito was willing to exchange the eight Germans for ten Partisans that were held by the Germans , Italians and NDH authorities . Glaise @-@ Horstenau contacted the commander of the Italian 2nd Army , Generale designato d ’ Armata ( acting General ) Mario Roatta , who had most of the identified Partisan prisoners in his custody . On 14 August , the German ambassador to the NDH , SA @-@ Obergruppenführer ( Lieutenant General ) Siegfried Kasche sent a telegram to the Reich Foreign Ministry advising of the proposed exchange and asked the Ministry to intercede with the Italians . In his book Tito , Mihailović , and the Allies , 1941 – 1945 , published in 1973 , the former US diplomat Walter Roberts argued that the Abwehr considered some sort of modus vivendi with the Partisans might be possible , and were thinking of more than prisoner exchanges when they gave Ott the task of making contact with the Partisans . The number of Germans in Partisan custody had been increasing , and this made some sort of prisoner swap agreement more likely . These agreements were initially led by Marijan Stilinović on behalf of the Partisan Supreme Headquarters . On 5 September , a prisoner swap was completed in an area between Duvno and Livno , where 38 Partisans and family members were exchanged for one senior German officer who had been captured during the Battle of Livno in December 1942 .",

In a 1980 article in The Musical Times , George Hauger commented that those critics not only underrated Offenbach , but wrongly supposed that his music would soon be forgotten . Although most critics of the time made that erroneous assumption , a few perceived Offenbach 's unusual quality ; in The Times , Francis Hueffer wrote , \" none of his numerous Parisian imitators has ever been able to rival Offenbach at his best . \" Nevertheless , the paper joined in the general prediction : \" It is very doubtful whether any of his works will survive . \" The New York Times shared this view : \" That he had the gift of melody in a very extraordinary degree is not to be denied , but he wrote currente calamo , and the lack of development of his choicest inspirations will , it is to be feared , keep them from reaching even the next generation \" .

  "\" Moment of Surrender \" was written by U2 and No Line on the Horizon producers / co @-@ writers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois during a two @-@ week recording session in Fez , Morocco between May and June 2007 . The song was developed within a few hours , and then recorded in a single take in a riad of the hotel Riad El Yacout .

He was unable to make an impact — Bedser removed him for one , caught by Evans at chest height off the inside edge from a ball that reared from the pitch . It was a difficult catch as Evans was standing up to the stumps and he had little time to react to the ball 's change of direction . O 'Reilly criticised the use of Johnson as an opener , as vice @-@ captain Lindsay Hassett had transformed himself into a defensive batsman with little backlift and a guarded approach . Johnson 's dismissal brought Bradman in to face the new ball . The Australian captain thus had to face Bedser , who had already dismissed him three times in the Tests with a new ball , and Pollard , who had troubled him in the match against Lancashire . Pollard then trapped Bradman lbw with an off cutter that struck the Australian captain on the back foot for seven to leave Australia in trouble at 13 / 2 . This provoked a strong cheer from the crowd in support of Pollard , the Lancashire local . Australia were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run , aiming for leg stump to stifle the scoring . He was partnered by Bedser , who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes .",

  "Hurricane Fred originated from a strong tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 6 . Environmental conditions ahead of the system favored development and the system was forecast to slowly develop into a tropical cyclone . The following day , the wave tracked south of the Cape Verde Islands ; however , it was close enough to bring showers and gusty winds to the southern islands . By this time , the National Hurricane Center anticipated the system to organize into a tropical depression within 24 hours . While passing near Cape Verde , a broad area of low pressure developed within the tropical wave . Following further development , the NHC declared that the low strengthened into a tropical depression , the seventh of the 2009 season , and issued their first advisory on it . Upon being classified a tropical depression , the system was located roughly 160 mi ( 260 km ) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands .",

When the line came about , Uggla and his ship Svärdet came on a collision course with the still floating wreckage of Kronan , and were forced to jibe ( turn the stern into the wind direction ) to avoid it . Svärdet 's second turn was interpreted by many ships as a signal to turn again ; others interpreted it as the beginning of a general retreat , leading to major disorder . Uggla reduced speed in an attempt to gather his forces , but instead was separated from his squadron .",

  "A tradition of cottage spinning and weaving and improvements to spinning technology by local inventors , Richard Arkwright and Samuel Crompton , led to rapid growth of the textile industry in the 19th century . Crompton , whilst living at Hall i ' th ' Wood , invented the spinning mule in 1779 . Streams draining the surrounding moorland into the River Croal provided the water necessary for bleach works that were a feature of this area . Bleaching using chlorine was introduced in the 1790s by the Ainsworths at Halliwell Bleachworks . Bolton and the surrounding villages had more than thirty bleachworks including the Lever Bank Bleach Works in the Irwell Valley . The mule revolutionised cotton spinning by combining the roller drafting of Arkwright 's water frame with the carriage drafting and spindle tip twisting of James Hargreaves 's spinning jenny , producing a high quality yarn . Self @-@ acting mules were used in Bolton mills until the 1960s producing fine yarn . The earliest mills were situated by the streams and river as at Barrow Bridge , but steam power led to the construction of the large multi @-@ storey mills and their chimneys that dominated Bolton 's skyline , some of which survive today .",

Many are injured or killed in these fights . Muskrat families build nests to protect themselves and their young from cold and predators . In streams , ponds or lakes , muskrats burrow into the bank with an underwater entrance . These entrances are 6 – 8 in ( 15 – 20 cm ) wide . In marshes , push @-@ ups are constructed from vegetation and mud . These push @-@ ups are up to 3 ft ( 91 cm ) in height . In snowy areas , they keep the openings to their push @-@ ups closed by plugging them with vegetation , which they replace every day .

  "Stephen A. Douglas ( D ) , the chair of the United States Senate Committee on Territories , drafted the bill authorizing the Minnesota Territory in 1848 . He had envisioned a future for the upper Mississippi valley , so he was motivated to keep the area from being carved up by neighboring territories . In 1846 , he had prevented Iowa from including Fort Snelling and Saint Anthony Falls within its northern border . In 1847 , he kept the organizers of Wisconsin from including Saint Paul and Saint Anthony Falls . The Minnesota Territory was established from the lands remaining from Iowa Territory and Wisconsin Territory on March 3 , 1849 . The Minnesota Territory extended far into what is now North Dakota and South Dakota , to the Missouri River . There was a dispute over the shape of the state to be carved out of Minnesota Territory . An alternate proposal that was only narrowly defeated would have made the 46th parallel the state 's northern border and the Missouri River its western border , thus giving up the whole northern half of the state in exchange for the eastern half of what later became South Dakota .",

Palmer identifies aesthetic similarities between the two , and points to several parallel characteristics and enthusiasms . Both were inspired early in their careers by Grieg , both admired Chopin ; they are also linked in their musical depictions of the sea , and in their uses of the wordless voice . The opening of Brigg Fair is described by Palmer as \" perhaps the most Debussian moment in Delius \" . Debussy , in a review of Delius 's Two Danish Songs for soprano and orchestra given in a concert on 16 March 1901 , wrote : \" They are very sweet , very pale — music to soothe convalescents in well @-@ to @-@ do neighbourhoods \" .

  "Herbivores are dependent on plants for food , and have evolved mechanisms to obtain this food despite the evolution of a diverse arsenal of plant defenses . Herbivore adaptations to plant defense have been likened to offensive traits and consist of adaptations that allow increased feeding and use of a host plant . Relationships between herbivores and their host plants often results in reciprocal evolutionary change , called co @-@ evolution . When an herbivore eats a plant it selects for plants that can mount a defensive response . In cases where this relationship demonstrates specificity ( the evolution of each trait is due to the other ) , and reciprocity ( both traits must evolve ) , the species are thought to have co @-@ evolved . The \" escape and radiation \" mechanism for co @-@ evolution presents the idea that adaptations in herbivores and their host plants have been the driving force behind speciation , and have played a role in the radiation of insect species during the age of angiosperms . Some herbivores have evolved ways to hijack plant defenses to their own benefit , by sequestering these chemicals and using them to protect themselves from predators . Plant defenses against herbivores are generally not complete so plants also tend to evolve some tolerance to herbivory .",

This means that during weak interactions , electron neutrinos behave like electrons .

Mechanisms available for the exercise of the right include the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament , Speakers ' Corner , and the new media . However , Article 14 enables Parliament to restrict the right to free speech on various grounds . One of these is the protection of reputation .

However , through the first half of the club 's 2008 – 09 campaign , Westley 's side were suffering from the same inconsistency that was common in his first spell as manager of the Hertfordshire side , losing three games on the trot in November – the last of which was a 2 – 1 home defeat to Wrexham , it was to be Stevenage 's last defeat at Broadhall Way in the league for 18 months . Westley brought in former player , Dino Maamria as first @-@ team coach at the club . This , coupled with important signings during the campaign , such as Chris Day , Mark Roberts , and Jon Ashton , meant that Stevenage witnessed an up @-@ turn in form half way through the campaign . A 24 @-@ game unbeaten run stretching from December 2008 to April 2009 , as well as winning crucial games towards the latter stages of the season , ultimately meant that Westley 's men made the Conference Premier play @-@ offs , finishing in the last play @-@ off place . Despite taking a 3 – 1 lead into the second leg , Stevenage lost 4 – 3 overall on aggregate to Cambridge United . Westley did , however , enjoy success in the FA Trophy when he led the side out at Wembley Stadium in front of 27 @,@ 102 as Stevenage beat York City 2 – 0 in the Final . The win was Westley 's first taste of success as manager of Stevenage . After the game , it was announced that Westley was to stay on as manager for another year .",
  "The stability of nuclei decreases greatly with the increase in atomic number after plutonium , the heaviest primordial element , so that all isotopes with an atomic number above 101 decay radioactively with a half @-@ life under a day , with an exception of dubnium @-@ 268 . No elements with atomic numbers above 82 ( after lead ) have stable isotopes . Nevertheless , because of reasons not very well understood yet , there is a slightly increased nuclear stability around atomic numbers 110 – 114 , which leads to the appearance of what is known in nuclear physics as the \" island of stability \" . This concept , proposed by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg , hypothesizes why superheavy elements last longer than predicted . Ununoctium is radioactive and has a half @-@ life that appears to be less than a millisecond .

The synthesis of this termetallocene involves the combining of rhodocenium and cobaltocenium solutions with 1 @,@ 1 ' -dilithioferrocene . This produces an uncharged intermediate with linked cyclopentadienyl – cyclopentadiene ligands whose bonding resembles that found in the rhodocene dimer .

  "In Katherine Buetow 's guide to the Australian Cattle Dog , Ian Dunbar makes the point that while people think of dog training as teaching a dog to sit , speak and roll over , the dog already knows how to do these things . Training , he says , involves teaching the dog that it is a good idea to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given . He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels , so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do , and knows that it will be worth its while to do it . Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required , as recommended by Dunbar , or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed . Like other working breeds , the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive ; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured , varied program is used , but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent , or is repetitive and boring for the dog . Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment . Many of a Cattle Dog 's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet : barking , chewing , chasing , digging , defending territory , and nipping heels . Training , therefore , involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors . The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable , and responds well to training .",

I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me . It 's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she 's unapologetic and she 's confident and she 's making Puck work for it and she 's not just looking for a roll in the hay . I think that they are very sweet together , there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there . What I appreciate about Lauren is that she 's like I don 't need to give it to you , you 're going to work for it , and I think that 's a great message to send to young girls . I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that 's kind of after her . \" Kevin Fallon , a writer for The Atlantic , reacted favorably to the casting of Fink : \" Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions .

  "Christ Illusion was recorded via computer between two studios : NRG Studios , North Hollywood , with assistant engineer Dave Colvin ; and Westlake Studios , Los Angeles , where Brian Warwick assisted . Guitarist Kerry King recalls nine of the eleven songs originally slated for Christ Illusion were demoed in 2004 , with Dave Lombardo at the drum kit . However , Lombardo recalls recording with King as far back as early 2003 , when two demos were completed at Lombardo 's home . In a July 2004 interview , guitarist Jeff Hanneman reported \" Me and Kerry have a bunch of songs , \" and expressed the band 's intent to finish the record that year . Slayer 's label American Recordings was at the time negotiating a switch of record distributors from Columbia Records to Warner Bros.

For this reason the group did not finish a record at that time , as the distribution deal with Warner Records was not finalized until late July 2005 .",

The appeal of grunge to the music press was that it \" promised the return to a notion of a regional , authorial vision for American rock \" . Grunge 's popularity in the underground music scene was such that bands began to move to Seattle and approximate the look and sound of the original grunge bands .

  "That conquest was a consequence of the Augustan imperative of securing the Imperial borders .

Unable to handle the added pressure , the Persian vanguard was forced to withdraw from the river bank , allowing the Macedonian phalanx to continue their advance and lifting the pressure on Parmenion 's left wing .",
  "Other commentators believe the film forecast the 1994 Republican Revolution and used the image of Forrest Gump to promote movement leader Newt Gingrich 's traditional , conservative values .

  "Lemur diets are highly variable and demonstrate a high degree of plasticity , although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects ( omnivory ) , while the larger species are more herbivorous , consuming mostly plant material .

For instance , the ring @-@ tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore . Coquerel 's giant mouse lemur ( Mirza coquereli ) is mostly frugivorous , but will consume insect secretions during the dry season .",

  "These changes also included shifts in social and cultural beliefs . The period saw the disintegration of the older feudal order , the destruction of the monasteries and widespread economic changes , altering the links between castles and the surrounding estates . Within castles , the Renaissance saw the introduction of the idea of public and private spaces , placing new value on castles having private spaces for the lord or his guests away from public view . Although the elite in Britain and Ireland continued to maintain and build castles in the style of the late medieval period there was a growing understanding through the Renaissance , absent in the 14th century , that domestic castles were fundamentally different from the military fortifications being built to deal with the spread of gunpowder artillery . Castles continued to be built and reworked in what cultural historian Matthew Johnson has described as a \" conscious attempt to invoke values seen as being under threat \" . The results , as at Kenilworth Castle for example , could include huge castles deliberately redesigned to appear old and sporting chivalric features , but complete with private chambers , Italian loggias and modern luxury accommodation .",

  "In Iron Age and Early Medieval Northern Europe , blót referred to animal sacrifice performed to thank the deities and gain their favor .

Animals used for this purpose have included poultry as well as larger mammals like sheep and pigs , with the meat then being consumed by those attending the rite . Some practitioners have made alterations to this procedure : Strmiska noted two American Heathens who decided to use a rifle shot to the head to kill the animal swiftly , a decision made after they witnessed a blót in which the animal 's throat was cut incorrectly and it slowly died in agony ; they felt that such practices would have displeased the gods and accordingly brought harm upon those carrying out the sacrifice .",

  "Tractatus de globis begins with a letter by Hues dedicated to Raleigh that recalled geographical discoveries made by Englishmen during Elizabeth I 's reign . However , he felt that his countrymen would have surpassed the Spaniards and Portuguese if they had a complete knowledge of astronomy and geometry , which were essential to successful navigation . In the preface of the book , Hues rehearsed arguments that proved the earth is a sphere , and refuted opposing theories . The treatise was divided into five parts . The first part described elements common to Molyneux 's terrestrial and celestial globes , including the circles and lines inscribed on them , zones and climates , and the use of each globe 's wooden horizon circle and brass meridian . The second part described planets , fixed stars and constellations ; while the third part described the lands and seas shown on the terrestrial globe , and discussed the length of the circumference of the earth and of a degree of a great circle . Part 4 , which Hues considered the most important part of the work , explained how the globes enabled seamen to determine the sun 's position , latitude , course and distance , amplitudes and azimuths , and time and declination . The final part of the work contained a treatise inspired by Harriot on rhumb lines . In the work , Hues also published for the first time the six fundamental navigational propositions involved in solving what was later termed the \" nautical triangle \" used for plane sailing . Difference of latitude and departure ( or longitude ) are two sides of the triangle forming a right angle , the distance travelled is the hypotenuse , and the angle between difference of latitude and distance is the course . If any two elements are known , the other two can be determined by plotting or calculation using tables of sines , tangents and secants .",

  "Linois 's operations in the Indian Ocean have been compared to those of Captain Karl von Müller in SMS Emden 108 years later : like von Müller , Linois 's raids caused significant concern among British merchant houses and the British authorities in the Indian Ocean , in Linois 's case principally due to the threat he posed to the East Indiaman convoys such as that encountered off Pulo Aura . The practical effects of his raiding were however insignificant : in three years he took just five East Indiamen and a handful of country ships , briefly terrorising the Andhra coast in 1804 but otherwise failing to cause major economic disruption to British trade . The only achievement of his cruise was to force Rainier 's squadron to operate in defence of British convoys and ports , preventing any offensive operations during Linois 's time in the Indian Ocean . The vast distances between friendly ports , the lack of sufficient food supplies or naval stores and the strength of British naval escorts after the initial months of war all played a part in Linois 's failings to fully exploit his opportunity , but the blame for his inadequate achievements has been consistently placed with Linois 's own personal leadership failings , both among his contemporaries and by historians . In battle Linois refused to place his ships in danger if it could be avoided , he spent considerable periods of the cruise refitting at French harbours and even when presented with an undefended target was reluctant to press his advantage .",
  "Virtually all microbes can trigger an antibody response . Successful recognition and eradication of many different types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies ; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens . It has been estimated that humans generate about 10 billion different antibodies , each capable of binding a distinct epitope of an antigen . Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual , the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited by the size of the human genome . Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes .",

Republicans in Congress disagreed , arguing the action contradicted claims Obama made during his presidential campaign about ethical conduct and transparency in government . Darrell Issa , in particular , felt it was an impeachable offense and referred to it as \" Obama 's Watergate \" . Nevertheless , the matter gradually became less of a focus during the primary election , where other topics like spending and the economy took the spotlight .

  "Tartarus is the game 's main dungeon , which can be visited during the evening , provided the conditions allow it ( e.g. the absence of some characters may prevent the player from visiting Tartarus that night ) . The player may order the other party members to split up to explore the area , or automatically attack Shadows on sight . Players will eventually come across boss floors , in which the player must defeat powerful Shadows in order to continue their progress . Additionally , certain floors halt further progress through the tower until the story progresses . Occasionally , innocent civilians will wander into Tartarus , winding up on certain floors . Rescuing these civilians safely before a full moon appears grants bonus rewards obtained from the police station . Spending too much time in Tartarus may cause characters to become \" Tired \" or \" Sick \" , which can affect their performance during battle . Additionally , if the protagonist becomes Tired or Sick , some activities , such as studying at night , may be hampered . Players can recover their status by taking certain items , visiting the infirmary , or going to bed early .",

  "Jim Rickards , in his 2011 book \" Currency Wars : The Making of the Next Global Crisis , \" argues that the consequences of the Fed 's attempts to prop up economic growth could be devastating for American national security . Though Rickard 's book is largely concerned with currency war as competitive devaluation , it uses a broader definition of the term , classing policies that cause inflation as currency war . Such policies can be seen as metaphorical warfare against those who have monetary assets in favor of those who do not , but unless the effects of rising inflation on international trade are offset by a devaluation , inflationary policies tend to make a country 's exports less competitive against foreign countries . In their review of the book , Publishers Weekly said : \" Rickards 's first book is an outgrowth of his contributions and a later two @-@ day war game simulation held at the Applied Physics Laboratory 's Warfare Analysis Laboratory . He argues that a financial attack against the U.S. could destroy confidence in the dollar . In Rickards 's view , the Fed 's policy of quantitative easing by lessening confidence in the dollar , may lead to chaos in global financial markets . \" Kirkus Reviews said : \" In Rickards ’ view , the world is currently going through a third currency war ( \" CWIII \" ) based on competitive devaluations . CWII occurred in the 1960s and ’ 70s and culminated in Nixon 's decision to take the dollar off the gold standard . CWI followed WWI and included the 1923 German hyperinflation and Roosevelt 's devaluation of the dollar against gold in 1933 . Rickards demonstrates that competitive devaluations are a race to the bottom , and thus instruments of a sort of warfare . CWIII , he writes , is characterized by the Federal Reserve 's policy of quantitative easing , which he ascribes to what he calls \" extensive theoretical work \" on depreciation , negative interest rates and stimulation achieved at the expense of other countries . He offers a view of how the continued depreciation and devaluation of the dollar will ultimately lead to a collapse , which he asserts will come about through a widespread abandonment of a worthless inflated instrument . Rickards also provides possible scenarios for the future , including collaboration among a variety of currencies , emergence of a world central bank and a forceful U.S. return to a gold standard through an emergency powers – based legal regime . The author emphasizes that these questions are matters of policy and choice , which can be different . \"",

The faculty and administration expressed concern over the strength of the team and made efforts to reduce the influence of professionalism on the players . During the 1910s , some sportswriters suggested that the Presidents were one of the top teams in the nation . The greatest achievement in the team 's history was in 1921 , when the Presidents appeared in the 1922 Rose Bowl , playing the heavily favored California Golden Bears to a scoreless tie . As college football evolved in the 1930s and 1940s , the Presidents fell far behind their larger competitors , who were able to offer scholarships for their players . Controversy over the poor play of the football team , and a lack of play against larger teams , contributed to the resignation of a college president . In the 1950s the team joined NCAA Division III and the Presidents ' Athletic Conference . By the 1980s , the team had learned to thrive in that environment , winning a number of conference championships and regularly qualifying for the NCAA Division III playoffs .",

  "The name \" Cincinnati chili \" is often confusing to those unfamiliar with it because the term \" chili \" evokes the expectation of chili con carne , which it \" bears no resemblance to . \" Cincinnati chili is a Mediterranean @-@ spiced meat sauce for spaghetti or hot dogs and is very seldom eaten by the bowl as is typical with chili con carne . It is common for Cincinnatians to describe it starting with , \" Well , it 's not really chili ... \" Cincinnati chili is always seasoned with cinnamon , usually contains allspice and cloves , and often contains some combination of cumin , paprika , nutmeg , and / or chili pepper . Many copycat recipes call for a small amount of chocolate , but according to Dann Woellert , author of The Authentic History of Cincinnati Chili , \" There is no chili parlor in Cincinnati that uses chocolate in its chili . \" It is normally of a thin consistency , closer to a soup than a stew , and contains no chunks of meat or vegetables , though it is common to find large pieces of cayenne pepper hulls in Empress chili . The consistency , seasonings , and serving method are more similar to pasta sauce or the spiced meat sauces used to top hot dogs in Rochester and other parts of Upstate New York , Rhode Island , and Michigan than they are to chili con carne .",

These guns had a maximum elevation of 12 degrees , with a range of 14 @,@ 500 m ( 47 @,@ 600 ft ) ; this was a result of the CSM 's belief that the decisive battle range would only be 6 @,@ 000 m ( 20 @,@ 000 ft ) and that fleets would not engage at ranges longer than 8 @,@ 000 m ( 26 @,@ 000 ft ) .

  "Some tax protesters have cited the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of Eisner v. Macomber for the theory that wages are not taxable , or for the theory that dividends are not taxable . The case dealt with a stock dividend on stock that was essentially equivalent to a stock split , as opposed to a cash dividend on stock . In the case of this kind of \" dividend \" the stockholder does not receive anything or realize any additional value . For example , if a stockholder owns 100 shares of stock having a value of $ 4 per share , the total value is $ 400 . If the corporation declares , say , a \" two for one \" stock dividend that is essentially similar to a stock split ( and the corporation distributes no money or other property ) , the stockholder now has 200 shares with a value of $ 2 each , which is still $ 400 in value - i.e. , no increase in value and no income .

  "When a stem is developing , the fungus is negatively geotropic , so that if the axis of the stem is tilted by 90 degrees , it will return to a vertical position within 24 hours . The extending hyphae that form the cap are themselves diageotropic — they will grow at right angles to the direction of gravity . Finally , the spines are positively geotropic , and will re @-@ orient themselves to point downward if the mushroom orientation changes . Because the second ( cap formation ) and third ( spine formation ) geotropic responses overlap , there is a brief period where two different geotropic responses are operating simultaneously . These geotropic transitions help ensure that the final alignment results in optimum spore dispersal .",
  "A state of civil disorder existed in the island 's mountainous region after the invasion of the United States . The local Criollo , who now found themselves unemployed and felt that they had been exploited by their former employers , formed bands called ' Partidas \" . The Partidas , at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners , who were loyal to the Spanish Crown , in vengeance , however they later began to attack the businesses owned by the local natives . One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. ' Aguila Blanca \" . Maldonado , who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce , harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and later did the same to the American Forces . Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed on the island . These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers . Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly , under the influence of alcohol , and get into fights with the local residents . The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuilt Puerto Rico 's infrastructure , thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population , and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular Army .",

  "In 2001 , Bruce Rothschild and others published a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs and the implications for their behavior . Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events they are more likely to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury . Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration , resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand . Allosaurus was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion , and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb . When the researchers looked for stress fractures , they found that Allosaurus had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than Albertosaurus , Ornithomimus or Archaeornithomimus . Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied , 3 were found to contain stress fractures . Of the feet , 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures . The stress fractures in the foot bones \" were distributed to the proximal phalanges \" and occurred across all three weight @-@ bearing toes in \" statistically indistinguishable \" numbers . Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress . If the allosaurs ' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or running this bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others . The lack of such a bias in the examined Allosaurus fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running . The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey , like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet . The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in Allosaurus provide evidence for \" very active \" predation @-@ based rather than scavenging diets .",

  "The final decades of this era saw a worsening economic situation for many Plebeians . The long military campaigns had forced citizens to leave their farms , which often caused those farms to fall into a state of disrepair . This situation was made worse during the Second Punic War , when Hannibal fought the Romans throughout Italy , and the Romans adopted a strategy of attrition and guerrilla warfare in response . When the soldiers returned from the battlefield , they often had to sell their farms to pay their debts , and the landed aristocracy quickly bought these farms at discounted prices . The wars had also brought to Rome a great surplus of inexpensive slave labor , which the landed aristocrats used to staff their new farms .

  "In many aspects , Cabernet Sauvignon can reflect the desires and personality of the winemaker while still presenting familiar flavors that express the typical character of the variety . The most pronounced effects are from the use of oak during production . Typically the first winemaking decision is whether or not to produce a varietal or blended wine . The \" Bordeaux blend \" of Cabernet Sauvignon , Merlot and Cabernet franc , with potentially some Malbec , Petit Verdot or Carménère , is the classic example of blended Cabernet Sauvignon , emulated in the United States with wines produced under the \" Meritage \" designation . But Cabernet Sauvignon can be blended with a variety of grapes such as Shiraz , Tempranillo and Sangiovese . The decision to blend is then followed by the decision of when to do the blending — before , during or after fermentation . Due to the different fermentation styles of the grapes , many producers will ferment and age each grape variety separately and blend the wine shortly before bottling .",

  "A new feature in Final Fantasy XII is the \" gambit \" system , which allows the player to program each character to perform certain commands in battle in response to specified conditions . Using gambits , the player may set reactions to different stimuli for each character . Each gambit consists of three parts : a target , an action , and a priority . The target specifies which ally or foe to act on and the condition for applying the action . For example , the target \" Ally : HP < 70 % \" causes the character to target any ally whose hit points have fallen below 70 % . The action is the command to be performed on the target . The priority determines which gambit to perform when multiple gambits are triggered . These heuristics guide the characters when acting autonomously , though player @-@ directed commands are always given top priority .",

The method of government after the conquest can be described as a feudal system , in that the new nobles held their lands on behalf of the king ; in return for promising to provide military support and taking an oath of allegiance , called homage , they were granted lands termed a fief or an honour . Major nobles in turn granted lands to smaller landowners in return for homage and further military support , and eventually the peasantry held land in return for local labour services , creating a web of loyalties and resources enforced in part by new honorial courts . This system had been used in Normandy and concentrated more power in the king and the upper elite than the former Anglo @-@ Saxon system of government . The practice of slavery declined in the years after the conquest , as the Normans considered the practice backward and contrary to the teachings of the church .

  "Victory in the Franco @-@ Prussian War proved the capstone of the nationalist issue .

After the victory over Austria in 1866 , Prussia began internally asserting its authority to speak for the German states and defend German interests , while Austria began directing more and more of its attention to possessions in the Balkans .

Although Bismarck had led the transformation of Germany from a loose confederation into a federal nation state , he had not done it alone . Unification was achieved by building on a tradition of legal collaboration under the Holy Roman Empire and economic collaboration through the Zollverein .

  "Water megamasers were the first type of megamaser discovered . The first water megamaser was found in 1979 in NGC 4945 , a galaxy in the nearby Centaurus A / M83 Group . The first hydroxyl megamaser was found in 1982 in Arp 220 , which is the nearest ultraluminous infrared galaxy to the Milky Way . All subsequent OH megamasers that have been discovered are also in luminous infrared galaxies , and there are a small number of OH kilomasers hosted in galaxies with lower infrared luminosities . Most luminous infrared galaxies have recently merged or interacted with another galaxy , and are undergoing a burst of star formation . Many of the characteristics of the emission in hydroxyl megamasers are distinct from that of hydroxyl masers within the Milky Way , including the amplification of background radiation and the ratio of hydroxyl lines at different frequencies .

One Yule Eve , he set off in a ten @-@ oar boat to Orphir on Mainland , Orkney at the invitation of the Earl of Orkney , Paul Haakonsson . However , the boat was lost with all hands – as the Saga puts it , \" sad news as Valthiof was a most accomplished man \" . The Earl later granted Valthiof 's farm to Thorkel Flettir . Later , a rowdy Viking named Sweyn Asleifsson fled to Stroma , pursued by Earl Harald Haakonsson . The two men were trapped on the island due to bad weather but were persuaded to make peace by a mutual friend named Asmundi , who insisted that Sweyn and Harald should share the same bed .",

  "Immediately following the Soviet occupation of Lithuania , The Internationale replaced the Tautiška giesmė . When in 1944 ' The Internationale ' have been replaced by State Anthem of the Soviet Union in Soviet Union as official anthem , Tautiška giesmė was used as official anthem for the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic . An alternate anthem was created and introduced in 1950 . The music for that piece was composed by Balys Dvarionas and Jonas Švedas , and the words were written originally by Antanas Venclova . Following Stalin 's death in 1953 , its lyrics were modified by Vacys Reimeris to remove reference to the former dictator . This anthem stated that Lenin had lit the path to freedom , helped by the Russian people , and exhorted the Lithuanian people to work with peoples of the other Soviet Republics . The anthem was confirmed in Article 169 of the 1978 Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR . The song continued to be used until Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union . Already in 1988 , the Tautiška giesmė was suggested as a replacement for the Soviet Lithuanian anthem . After preliminary approval by the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR and successive legislative bodies , its status as the national anthem was reconfirmed in 1992 . In that year , the Constitution of Lithuania was approved ; Article 19 of the document states that Tautiška giesmė will be the national anthem of Lithuania . The last law in relation to the national anthem was passed in 1999 ; it contained the official lyrics and protocol on how and when to play the anthem .",

  "Silk was made using various breeds of lepidopterans , both wild and domestic . While wild silks were produced in many countries , there is no doubt that the Chinese were the first to begin production on such a large scale , having the most effective species for silk production , the Bombyx mandarina and its domesticated descendent B. mori . Chinese sources claim the existence of a machine to unwind silkworm cocoons in 1090 . The cocoons were placed in a large basin of hot water , the silk would leave the cauldron by tiny guiding rings , and would be wound onto a large spool , thanks to a backwards and forward motion . Little information exists about spinning techniques in use in China . The spinning wheel , in all likelihood moved by hand , was known by the beginning of the Christian era .

  "Its effects , depending on dosage , include an increase in sodium excretion by the kidneys , an increase in urine output , an increase in heart rate , and an increase in blood pressure . At low doses it acts through the sympathetic nervous system to increase heart muscle contraction force and heart rate , thereby increasing cardiac output and blood pressure . Higher doses also cause vasoconstriction that further increases blood pressure . Older literature also describes very low doses thought to improve kidney function without other consequences , but recent reviews have concluded that doses at such low levels are not effective and may sometimes be harmful . While some effects result from stimulation of dopamine receptors , the prominent cardiovascular effects result from dopamine acting at α1 , β1 , and β2 adrenergic receptors .",

  "The simplest possible ununseptium compound would be the monohydride , UusH . The bonding is expected to be provided by a 7p3 / 2 electron of ununseptium and the 1s electron of hydrogen . The non @-@ bonding nature of the 7p1 / 2 spinor is because ununseptium is expected not to form purely sigma or pi bonds . Therefore , the destabilized ( thus expanded ) 7p3 / 2 spinor is responsible for bonding . This effect lengthens the UusH molecule by 17 picometers compared with the overall length of 195 pm . Since the ununseptium p electron bonds are two @-@ thirds sigma , the bond is only two @-@ thirds as strong as it would be if ununseptium featured no spin – orbit interactions . The molecule thus follows the trend for halogen hydrides , showing an increase in bond length and a decrease in dissociation energy compared to AtH . The molecules TlUus and UutUus may be viewed analogously , taking into account an opposite effect shown by the fact that the element 's p1 / 2 electrons are stabilized . These two characteristics result in a relatively small dipole moment ( product of difference between electric charges of atoms and displacement of the atoms ) for TlUus ; only 1 @.@ 67 D , the positive value implying that the negative charge is on the ununseptium atom . For UutUus , the strength of the effects are predicted to cause a transfer of the electron from the ununseptium atom to the ununtrium atom , with the dipole moment value being − 1 @.@ 80 D. The spin – orbit interaction increases the dissociation energy of the UusF molecule because it lowers the electronegativity of ununseptium , causing the bond with the extremely electronegative fluorine atom to have a more ionic character . Ununseptium monofluoride should feature the strongest bonding of all group 17 element monofluorides .",

Positioned along the fuselage centreline , the smaller rear lift propeller was mounted vertically , while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17 degrees . According to later claims , Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel , witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow . It was around this time that Coandă 's interest in jet propulsion began , claiming that the aircraft and a jet @-@ propelled model were displayed in December 1907 at the Sporthalle indoor sports arena in Berlin . Coandă continued his studies at Liege , Belgium , where together with his roommate and friend Giovanni Battista Caproni he built the Coandă @-@ Caproni box glider , based on the plans of gliders designed by Otto Lilienthal and Octave Chanute which he previously studied at Charlottenburg and Spandau .

  "Blood Sugar Sex Magik integrated the band 's typical punk and funk style , but moved away from this with more melodically driven songs . Tracks like \" The Righteous and the Wicked , \" \" Suck My Kiss , \" \" Blood Sugar Sex Magik , \" \" Give it Away \" and \" Funky Monks \" still incorporated use of heavy metal guitar riffs , but differed from Mother 's Milk in that they contained less distortion . Flea , who had centered his bass playing around the slapping technique , downplayed on this in favor of more traditional and melodic bass lines . He also adopted a minimalist , \" less is more \" philosophy : \" I was trying to play simply on Blood Sugar Sex Magik because I had been playing too much prior to that , so I thought , ' I 've really got to chill out and play half as many notes ' . When you play less , it 's more exciting — there 's more room for everything . If I do play something busy , it stands out , instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes . Space is good . \" Kiedis felt that the album would expand the Chili Peppers ' musical horizons , and that it was a departure from their previous material . One of Blood Sugar Sex Magik 's more melodic tracks , \" Breaking the Girl , \" was written about Kiedis ' constantly shifting relationships . He feared that he was following in his father 's footsteps and simply becoming a womanizer , rather than establishing stable and long @-@ term relationships : \" ... As exciting and temporarily fulfilling as this constant influx of interesting and beautiful girls can be , at the end of the day , that shit is lonely and you 're left with nothing . \" The track also featured a bridge in the middle , consisting of percussion instruments salvaged from a garbage dump .",
