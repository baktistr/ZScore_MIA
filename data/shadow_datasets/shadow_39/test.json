  "The claim that all humans are due dignity and respect as autonomous agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed upon anyone , and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society . Kant 's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely as a means to an end , leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices . Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they do not treat women as ends . Kant also believed that , because animals do not possess rationality , we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them .

  "Iverson 's career turned out to be meteoric on the downward trajectory as well as the upward , and when the West Indies arrived for their 1951 – 52 tour in November 1951 in what was billed as a \" cricket championship of the world \" , the Australian Test selectors turned to Ring for the spin option to the pace of Lindwall , Miller and Bill Johnston for the first match at Brisbane . With the famous spin twins of Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine in the opposition , Ring was the least experienced main line bowler at this level on either side – but he proved to be the matchwinner . Having taken two wickets in West Indies ' first innings , he took six for 80 runs in the second , and his dismissal of Frank Worrell and captain John Goddard with the last two balls of the second day swung the advantage towards Australia .

  "The origin of the luminescence colors is often unclear and not unique . Blue emission from type IIa and IIb diamonds is reliably identified with dislocations by directly correlating the emission with dislocations in an electron microscope . However , blue emission in type Ia diamond could be either due to dislocations or the N3 defects ( three nitrogen atoms bordering a vacancy ) . Green emission in natural diamond is usually due to the H3 center ( two substitutional nitrogen atoms separated by a vacancy ) , whereas in synthetic diamond it usually originates from nickel used as a catalyst ( see figure ) . Orange or red emission could be due to various reasons , one being the nitrogen @-@ vacancy center which is present in sufficient quantities in all types of diamond , even type IIb .",

  "Issues arose over authority to control the upbringing of his heir @-@ presumptive . As head of the Coburg family , Ernest would normally have been able to arrange Alfred 's education and general upbringing unchallenged . This however was not the case . Alfred was torn between his British birth and his German inheritance . This was partly because Alfred was second @-@ in @-@ line to the United Kingdom until the birth of his nephew Prince Albert Victor , Duke of Clarence and Avondale , in 1864 . One example of the many problems of his education concerned the language he would speak . Although he grew up learning German , his native language was decided to be English . In addition , a naval career was chosen for Alfred , a common profession for a British prince but almost unheard of for a prince of Germany . Ernest also wanted Alfred to be educated in Coburg , but his brother refused . Albert 's refusal most likely stemmed from the negative British reaction that would have inevitably occurred and the fact that Albert was fearful of Alfred 's moral development . Thus despite Ernest 's protests , he went unheeded in Albert 's lifetime . In 1863 , Ernest told Victoria that it was time for Alfred to leave the navy and enter a German university . By March of the following year , it was decided that Alfred would attend Bonn University but be left to consider his future , as he was having reservations over permanently residing outside England . The matter was eventually resolved ; Alfred came to accept his inheritance , and Victoria understood and accepted that Ernest needed to be involved in the upbringing of his heir @-@ presumptive , with a strong German element added to his education and ( carefully chaperoned ) visits to Coburg .",

  "In December 1902 , the German government asked Roosevelt to arbitrate its dispute with Venezuela over unpaid debts . Hay did not think this appropriate , as Venezuela also owed the U.S. money , and quickly arranged for the International Court of Arbitration in The Hague to step in . Hay supposedly said , as final details were being worked out , \" I have it all arranged .

The commission was to be composed of \" impartial jurists \" and the British and Canadians duly appointed notable judges . Roosevelt appointed politicians , including Secretary Root and Senator Lodge . Although Hay was supportive of the President 's choices in public , in private he protested loudly to Roosevelt , complained by letter to his friends , and offered his resignation .

  "Natural selection played a major role in the development of the breed , as large numbers of horses died from lack of food and exposure to the elements . Between 874 and 1300 AD , during the more favorable climatic conditions of the medieval warm period , Icelandic breeders selectively bred horses according to special rules of color and conformation . From 1300 to 1900 , selective breeding became less of a priority ; the climate was often severe and many horses and people died . Between 1783 and 1784 , around 70 % of the horses in Iceland were killed by volcanic ash poisoning and starvation after the 1783 eruption of Lakagígar . The eruption lasted eight months , covered hundreds of square miles of land with lava , and rerouted or dried up several rivers .

  "The period after the Second World War saw a flowering of scholarship on Austen as well as a diversity of critical approaches . One of the most fruitful and contentious has been the consideration of Austen as a political writer . As critic Gary Kelly explains , \" Some see her as a political ' conservative ' because she seems to defend the established social order . Others see her as sympathetic to ' radical ' politics that challenged the established order , especially in the form of patriarchy ... some critics see Austen 's novels as neither conservative nor subversive , but complex , criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy . \" In Jane Austen and the War of Ideas ( 1975 ) , perhaps the most important of these works , Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was steeped in , not insulated from , the principal moral and political controversies of her time , and espoused a partisan , fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies . In a similar vein , Alistair M. Duckworth in The Improvement of the Estate : A Study of Jane Austen 's Novels ( 1971 ) argues that Austen used the concept of the \" estate \" to symbolise all that was important about contemporary English society , which should be conserved , improved , and passed down to future generations . As Rajeswari Rajan notes in her essay on recent Austen scholarship , \" the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged \" . The questions scholars now investigate involve : \" the [ French ] Revolution , war , nationalism , empire , class , ' improvement ' [ of the estate ] , the clergy , town versus country , abolition , the professions , female emancipation ; whether her politics were Tory , Whig , or radical ; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary , or occupied a reformist position between these extremes \" .",
  "When the idea of a modern Olympics became a reality at the end of the 19th century , the initiators and organizers were looking for a great popularizing event , recalling the ancient glory of Greece . The idea of organizing a ' marathon race ' came from Michel Bréal , who wanted the event to feature in the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens . This idea was heavily supported by Pierre de Coubertin , the founder of the modern Olympics , as well as the Greeks . This would echo the legendary version of events , with the competitors running from Marathon to Athens . So popular was this event that it quickly caught on , becoming a fixture at the Olympic games , with major cities staging their own annual events .

  "Several studies have quantified the amounts of hallucinogenic compounds found in the fruit bodies of Psilocybe semilanceata .

In an earlier analysis , Tjakko Stijve and Thom Kuyper ( 1985 ) found a high concentration in a single specimen ( 1 @.@ 7 % ) in addition to a relatively high concentration of baeocystin ( 0 @.@ 36 % ) . Smaller specimens tend to have the highest percent concentrations of psilocybin , but the absolute amount is highest in larger mushrooms . A Finnish study assayed psilocybin concentrations in old herbarium specimens , and concluded that although psilocybin concentration decreased linearly over time , it was relatively stable . They were able to detect the chemical in specimens that were 115 years old . Michael Beug and Jeremy Bigwood , analyzing specimens from the Pacific Northwest region of the United States , reported psilocybin concentrations ranging from 0 @.@ 62 % to 1 @.@ 28 % , averaging 1 @.@ 0 ± 0 @.@ 2 % . They concluded that the species was one of the most potent , as well as the most constant in psilocybin levels .

Although there are certain caveats with this technique — such as the unconfirmed assumption that these compounds contribute equally to psychoactive properties — it serves as a rough comparison of potency between species . Despite its small size , Psilocybe semilanceata is considered a \" moderately active to extremely potent \" hallucinogenic mushroom ( meaning the combined percentage of psychoactive compounds is typically between 0 @.@ 25 % to greater than 2 % ) , and of the 12 mushrooms compared , only 3 were more potent : P. azurescens , P. baeocystis , and P. bohemica .

  "Another way to view surface tension is in terms of energy . A molecule in contact with a neighbor is in a lower state of energy than if it were alone ( not in contact with a neighbor ) . The interior molecules have as many neighbors as they can possibly have , but the boundary molecules are missing neighbors ( compared to interior molecules ) and therefore have a higher energy . For the liquid to minimize its energy state , the number of higher energy boundary molecules must be minimized . The minimized quantity of boundary molecules results in a minimal surface area . As a result of surface area minimization , a surface will assume the smoothest shape it can ( mathematical proof that \" smooth \" shapes minimize surface area relies on use of the Euler – Lagrange equation ) . Since any curvature in the surface shape results in greater area , a higher energy will also result . Consequently , the surface will push back against any curvature in much the same way as a ball pushed uphill will push back to minimize its gravitational potential energy .",

This is compounded by the fact that Boswell held an opinion contradictory to two of these pamphlets , The False Alarm and Taxation No Tyranny , and so attacks Johnson 's views in his biography .",

  "Once a droplet has frozen , it grows in the supersaturated environment — one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point . The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air ( vapor ) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected . Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals due to their sheer abundance , the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by a process known as the Wegner @-@ Bergeron @-@ Findeison process . The corresponding depletion of water vapor causes the ice crystals to grow at the droplets ' expense . These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation , since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass , and may collide and stick together in clusters , or aggregates . These aggregates are snowflakes , and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground . Guinness World Records list the world 's largest snowflakes as those of January 1887 at Fort Keogh , Montana ; allegedly one measured 38 cm ( 15 in ) wide . Although the ice is clear , scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows / imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles .",

There is archaeological evidence that suggests that the royal influence predates any of the written sources , and it may have been Eadbald 's father , Æthelberht , who took control of trade away from the aristocracy and made it a royal monopoly .

Kent traded locally made glass and jewelry to the Franks ; Kentish goods have been found as far south as the mouth of the Loire , south of Brittany .

  "Like the vision of Banquo 's lineage , the banquet scene has also been the subject of criticism .

The northern population mainly winters in the western Caribbean ( Cuba and Jamaica ) while the southern population usually spends the winter on eastern islands ( Hispaniola and Puerto Rico ) . Moreover , males in the southern population have darker plumage than those in the northern population . These differences have led biologists to consider them as separate subspecies . However , a recent study in the United States reveals no significant genetic differentiation between northern ( samples from Michigan , New Hampshire and New York states ) and southern populations ( sample from North Carolina ) . The study results actually show a recent population expansion from a single glacial refugium , therefore the current populations are homogeneous in terms of genetics .

  "The project would soon head off in more productive directions , largely impelled by a trip of Edison 's to Europe and the Exposition Universelle in Paris , for which he departed August 2 or 3 , 1889 . During his two months abroad , Edison visited with scientist @-@ photographer Étienne @-@ Jules Marey , who had devised a \" chronophotographic gun \" — the first portable motion picture camera — which used a strip of flexible film designed to capture sequential images at twelve frames per second . Upon his return to the United States , Edison filed another patent caveat , on November 2 , which described a Kinetoscope based not just on a flexible filmstrip , but one in which the film was perforated to allow for its engagement by sprockets , making its mechanical conveyance much more smooth and reliable . The first motion picture system to employ a perforated image band was apparently the Théâtre Optique , patented by French inventor Charles @-@ Émile Reynaud in 1888 . Reynaud 's system did not use photographic film , but images painted on gelatine frames . At the Exposition Universelle , Edison would have seen both the Théâtre Optique and the electrical tachyscope of German inventor Ottamar Anschütz . This disc @-@ based projection device is often referred to as an important conceptual source for the development of the Kinetoscope . Its crucial innovation was to take advantage of the persistence of vision theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily \" freeze \" the projection of each image ; the goal was to facilitate the viewer 's retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity , thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion . By late 1890 , intermittent visibility would be integral to the Kinetoscope 's design .",

  "Many species of insects are toxic or distasteful when they have fed on certain plants that contain chemicals of particular classes , but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals . For instance , some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae , which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators . Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned . When feeding on innocuous plants however , they are harmless and nutritious , but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration . When regarded as mimicry of toxic members of the same species , this too may be seen as automimicry .",

  "Nash was slower and more portly than he was in the 1930s , short of match practice and forced to spend most Sundays in hospital having fluid drained from his injured knees swollen from the exertions of the day before , forcing South Melbourne coach Bull Adams to nurse Nash through the season . Additionally , in the Round 5 match against Footscray , he tore the webbing between his fingers which later became infected , causing him to miss the Round 6 match against North Melbourne and although Nash wore a special leather glove to protect his hand , the injury would trouble him for the rest of the season . Despite these setbacks , Nash could still be a match winner and many opposition players saw him as the key player for South Melbourne . Nash 's best return for the year was seven goals against St Kilda in Round 12 and he twice kicked six goals in a match ; against Geelong in Round 15 and Fitzroy in Round 18 .

  "In the Crucifixion panel , van Eyck follows the early 14th @-@ century tradition of presenting the biblical episodes using a narrative technique .

This device allowed van Eyck to create a greater illusion of depth with more complex and unusual spatial arrangements .

  "Strapping Young Lad 's music was a diverse mix of extreme metal genres ; death metal , thrash metal , black metal , progressive , experimental and industrial metal . Many of the band 's songs showcased Townsend 's versatile vocal style , often changing from screaming , and growling to clean vocals , or even falsetto , within the course of a single song . According to Townsend , the band functioned as his \" outlet to freak out \" , and his two main projects , the more melodic The Devin Townsend Band and the aggressive Strapping Young Lad were \" supposed to be the positive and the negative \" . To achieve a chaotic and cacophonic sound the band utilized complex time signatures , polyrhythmic composition , blast beats , sampling , keyboard effects and intricately layered production . Townsend used the newest technology available , such as Pro Tools , Steinberg Cubase and Logic Pro , when recording , mixing and producing the band 's songs .

  "The definitive treatment for hepatorenal syndrome is liver transplantation , and all other therapies can best be described as bridges to transplantation . While liver transplantation is by far the best available management option for HRS , the mortality of individuals with HRS has been shown to be as high as 25 % within the first month after transplantation . Individuals with HRS and evidence of greater hepatic dysfunction ( quantified as MELD scores above 36 ) have been found to be at greatest risk of early mortality after liver transplantation . A further deterioration of kidney function even after liver transplantation in individuals with HRS has been demonstrated in several studies ; however , this is transient and thought to be due to the use of medications with toxicity to the kidneys , and specifically the introduction of immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus and cyclosporine that are known to worsen kidney function .

  "First appearing in East Africa in 1891 , rinderpest , a disease of cattle , spread rapidly across Africa . By 1892 , 95 per cent of the cattle in East Africa had died . This resulted in a famine that devastated the farmers and nomadic people , some of whom were entirely dependent on their cattle . Two thirds of the population of Maasai people died . The situation was made worse by epidemics of smallpox that followed in the wake of the famine . In the early years of the 20th century rinderpest was common in Asia and parts of Europe . The prevalence of the disease was steadily reduced during the century by control measures that included vaccination . By 1908 Europe was free from the disease . Outbreaks did occur following the Second World War , but these were quickly controlled . The prevalence of the disease increased in Asia , and in 1957 Thailand had to appeal for aid because so many buffaloes had died that the paddy fields could not be prepared for rice growing . Russia west of the Ural Mountains remained free from the disease – Lenin approved several laws on the control of the disease – but cattle in eastern Russia were constantly infected with rinderpest that originated in Mongolia and China where the prevalence remained high . India controlled the spread of the disease , which had retained a foothold in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala , throughout the 20th century , and had eradicated the disease by 1995 . Africa suffered two major panzootics in the 1920s and 1980s . There was a severe outbreak in Somalia in 1928 and the disease was widespread in the country until 1953 . In the 1980s , outbreaks in Tanzania and Kenya were controlled by the use of 26 million doses of vaccine , and a recurrence of the disease in 1997 was suppressed by an intensive vaccination campaign . By the end of the century rinderpest had been eradicated from most countries . A few pockets of infection remained in Ethiopia and Sudan , and in 1994 the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme was launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) with the aim of global eradication by 2010 . In May 2011 , the FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health announced that \" rinderpest as a freely circulating viral disease has been eliminated from the world . \"",

  "In 1982 , owners began blood @-@ typing their horses , and by 1990 , genetic testing found that \" compared with other draft breeds and based upon gene marker data , the Creams form a distinct group within the draft horses . \" The American Cream Draft was found to have a genetic relationship with the Belgian breed that was no closer than the ones it had with the Percheron , Suffolk Punch and Haflinger breeds . Registry records dating to the early 20th century show no bloodlines other than draft breeding . As of 2000 there were 222 registered horses , a number that increased to 350 as of 2004 . Of these , 40 were \" tracking horses \" – either purebred American Creams that did not meet color requirements or crossbred horses that mix American Cream and other draft blood , but still meet the physical requirements for the registry . These tracking horses are allowed by certain regulations to be used as breeding stock , with the resulting foals able to be registered as purebred American Creams . Around 30 new horses are registered each year . The Livestock Conservancy considers the breed to be at \" critical \" status , meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is less than 2 @,@ 000 and there are less than 200 registrations annually in the US . The Equus Survival Trust also considers the population to be \" critical \" , meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today .

  "A unique feature of the Homunculus is the ability to measure the spectrum of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes . These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles . In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane . By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening . The current axis of rotation of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus . This may be due to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds .",

  "Rick Berman , Jeri Taylor and Michael Piller had worked together as executive producers for the pilot of Voyager , \" Caretaker \" , and the following ten episodes . \" Heroes and Demons \" was the first episode where Piller wasn 't involved in the writing of the scripts because he had begun work on the series Legend .

  "Freitas finds numerous reasons why interstellar probes may be a preferred method of communication among extraterrestrial civilizations wishing to make contact with Earth . A civilization aiming to learn more about the distribution of life within the galaxy might , he speculates , send probes to a large number of star systems , rather than using radio , as one cannot ensure a response by radio but can ( he says ) ensure that probes will return to their sender with data on the star systems they survey . Furthermore , probes would enable the surveying of non @-@ intelligent populations , or those not yet capable of space navigation ( like humans before the 20th century ) , as well as intelligent populations that might not wish to provide information about themselves and their planets to extraterrestrial civilizations .

  "The Constitution was the product of a series of constitutional conventions in the 1890s . The issues of religious freedom and secularism were not prominent in the convention debates , which focused on the economic and legislative powers of the proposed Commonwealth parliament . The first draft of Section 116 , approved by the Melbourne Convention of 1891 , would have prohibited the states from passing laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion . The Commonwealth was not mentioned because it was assumed that the Commonwealth parliament would have no power to make such laws . At the Melbourne Convention of 1897 , Victorian delegate H. B. Higgins expressed concern about this assumption and moved to expand the provision to cover the Commonwealth as well as the states . The amendment was initially defeated , but Higgins later succeeded in having the eventual version of Section 116 adopted by the convention in a 25 – 16 vote . Higgins feared opposition to the provision from convention delegates concerned that the provision would impede the states ' legislative powers , so the version passed by the convention did not mention the states .",

  "As in the first Prayer Book , the origins and participants in the work of its revision are obscure , but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development . It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter . Late in 1550 , the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision . The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine . New rubrics noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the curate , thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence . The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead , as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory . The Act of Uniformity 1552 , which authorised the book 's use , specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November . However , the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute , due to Dudley 's intervention . While travelling in the north of the country , he met the Scots reformer , John Knox , then based in Newcastle . Impressed by his preaching , Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects . In a sermon before the king , Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion . On 27 September 1552 , the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it . He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy . On 22 October , the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so @-@ called Black Rubric , which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion .",

The Castro could find no one to take his place in its affections , and possibly wanted no one . \" On the 20th anniversary of Milk 's death , historian John D 'Emilio said , \" The legacy that I think he would want to be remembered for is the imperative to live one 's life at all times with integrity . \" For a political career so short , Cleve Jones attributes more to his assassination than his life : \" His murder and the response to it made permanent and unquestionable the full participation of gay and lesbian people in the political process . \"",

Lipsey developed the idea of a close person as the song 's inspiration . Buena wrote the first verse based upon her daughter Tahlia , who was born in March 2005 . While writing the verse , she pondered questions such as ' What would you say to her if she was ever in trouble ? ' , and ' How would you say , I ’ ll always be there for you ? ' .

The former — whose screenplay was written by the blacklisted Dalton Trumbo , disguised by a front — features a bank hold @-@ up sequence shown in an unbroken take of over three minutes that was influential . The Big Combo was shot by John Alton and took the shadowy noir style to its outer limits . The most distinctive films of Phil Karlson ( The Phenix City Story [ 1955 ] and The Brothers Rico [ 1957 ] ) tell stories of vice organized on a monstrous scale . The work of other directors in this tier of the industry , such as Felix E. Feist ( The Devil Thumbs a Ride [ 1947 ] , Tomorrow Is Another Day [ 1951 ] ) , has become obscure . Edgar G.

  "According to academic Rikky Rooksby , \" Good Vibrations \" is an example of Brian 's growing interest in musical development within a composition , something antithetical to popular music of the time . Suppressing tonic strength and cadential drive , the song makes use of descending harmonic motions through scale degrees controlled by a single tonic and \" radical disjunctions \" in key , texture , instrumentation , and mood while refusing to develop into a predictable formal pattern . It instead develops \" under its own power , \" and \" luxuriates in harmonic variety , \" exemplified by beginning and ending not only in different keys but also in different modes . Comparing \" Good Vibrations \" to Brian 's previous work Pet Sounds , biographer Andrew Hickey has said : \" [ T ] he best way of thinking about [ the song ] is that it 's taking the lowest common denominator of ' Here Today ' and ' God Only Knows ' and turned the result into an R & B track .

Chaplin diverged from conventional slapstick by slowing the pace and exhausting each scene of its comic potential , with more focus on developing the viewer 's relationship to the characters . Unlike conventional slapstick comedies , Robinson states that the comic moments in Chaplin 's films centre on the Tramp 's attitude to the things happening to him : the humour does not come from the Tramp bumping into a tree , but from his lifting his hat to the tree in apology . Dan Kamin writes that Chaplin 's \" quirky mannerisms \" and \" serious demeanour in the midst of slapstick action \" are other key aspects of his comedy , while the surreal transformation of objects and the employment of in @-@ camera trickery are also common features .",
  "Battles in Superstar Saga are turn @-@ based . Mario and Luigi can attack normally either by jumping , which can deal multiple hits but when used against enemies covered in flames or with spikes , Mario or Luigi will get hurt , instead of the enemy . Another attack option is the hammer , which is powerful , but ineffective against flying enemies . Similar to previous Mario RPG titles , such as Super Mario RPG and the Paper Mario series , players can time button presses to make their attacks more effective , such as earning an extra jump attack or increasing the hammer 's power . Introduced in this series is the way in which Mario and Luigi can defend themselves during an enemy 's attack . When an enemy attacks , the brothers will be able to either jump or use their hammer which , when successfully timed , allows them to dodge their attacks and even deal counter damage ( for example : if they jump on top of a charging Goomba ) . Throughout the game , players can unlock Bros. Attacks , which use Bros. Points ( BP ) which requires players to cooperate between Mario and Luigi 's actions to perform powerful combination attacks . Players can also use items such as mushrooms for healing , peppers for boosting stats and 1UP mushrooms for reviving fallen bros . Defeating enemies earns experience points which help the bros level up and increase their stats , with players given the option to further increase the stats of one attribute every time they level up . Players can further improve their stats by equipping new gear to the Bros. , or making them wear badges that give them special attributes .",
  "The Encyclopedia of Gay Histories and Cultures ( 2000 ) notes that gay subtext can be found in DC Comics publications as early as the Golden Age of Comic Books , with readers inferring homosexuality between superheroes and their same @-@ sex sidekicks and on the women @-@ only Paradise Island . Batman 's relationship with Robin has famously come under scrutiny , in spite of the majority of creators associated with the character denying that the character is gay . Psychologist Fredric Wertham , who in Seduction of the Innocent asserted that \" Batman stories are psychologically homosexual , \" claimed to find a \" subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature ' Batman ' and his young friend ' Robin . ' \" It has also been claimed that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because \" he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality , \" and \" the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp . \" Frank Miller has described the Joker as a \" homophobic nightmare , \" and views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting . Burt Ward has also remarked upon this interpretation in his autobiography , noting that the relationship between the two could be interpreted as a sexual one . When creating the character of Jericho in Teen Titans , Marv Wolfman and George Perez considered making him gay , which would have marked one of the first appearances of a gay character in a major super hero book . However , they ultimately passed on the idea after concluding that it would be too stereotypical to make the sensitive , artistic , effeminate featured Jericho a homosexual .",

  "Without finessing the join between upper and lower , between torso and legs , Rodin created a work that many sculptors at the time and subsequently have seen as one of his strongest and most singular works . This is despite the fact that the object conveys two different styles , exhibits two different attitudes toward finish , and lacks any attempt to hide the arbitrary fusion of these two components . It was the freedom and creativity with which Rodin used these practices – along with his activation surfaces of sculptures through traces of his own touch and with his more open attitude toward bodily pose , sensual subject matter , and non @-@ realistic surface – that marked Rodin 's re @-@ making of traditional 19th century sculptural techniques into the prototype for modern sculpture .",

  "Bowlby 's original account of a sensitivity period during which attachments can form of between six months and two to three years has been modified by later researchers . These researchers have shown that there is indeed a sensitive period during which attachments will form if possible , but the time frame is broader and the effect less fixed and irreversible than first proposed . With further research , authors discussing attachment theory have come to appreciate that social development is affected by later as well as earlier relationships . Early steps in attachment take place most easily if the infant has one caregiver , or the occasional care of a small number of other people . According to Bowlby , almost from the first many children have more than one figure toward whom they direct attachment behaviour . These figures are not treated alike ; there is a strong bias for a child to direct attachment behaviour mainly toward one particular person . Bowlby used the term \" monotropy \" to describe this bias . Researchers and theorists have abandoned this concept insofar as it may be taken to mean that the relationship with the special figure differs qualitatively from that of other figures . Rather , current thinking postulates definite hierarchies of relationships .",

  "The derivation of the Latin narcissus ( Greek : νάρκισσος ) is unknown . It may be a loanword from another language , for instance it is said to be related to the Sanskrit word nark , meaning ' hell ' . It is frequently linked to the Greek myth of Narcissus described by Ovid in his Metamorphoses , who became so obsessed with his own reflection that as he knelt and gazed into a pool of water , he fell into the water and drowned . In some variations , he died of starvation and thirst . In both versions , the narcissus plant sprang from where he died . Although Ovid appeared to describe the plant we now know as Narcissus there is no evidence for this popular derivation , and the person 's name may have come from the flower 's name . The Poet 's Narcissus ( N. poeticus ) , which grows in Greece , has a fragrance that has been described as intoxicating . Again , this explanation lacks any real proof and is largely discredited . Pliny wrote that the plant ‘ narce narcissum dictum , non a fabuloso puero ’ ( named narcissus from narce , not from the legendary youth ) , i.e. that it was named for its narcotic properties ( ναρκάω narkao , \" I grow numb \" in Greek ) , not from the legend . Furthermore , there were accounts of narcissi growing , such as in the legend of Persephone , long before the story of Narcissus appeared ( see Greek culture ) . It has also been suggested that daffodils bending over streams evoked the image of the youth admiring his own reflection in the water .",
  "The first of Britten 's song cycles to gain widespread popularity was Les Illuminations ( 1940 ) , for high voice ( originally soprano , later more often sung by tenors ) with string orchestra accompaniment , setting words by Arthur Rimbaud .

Matthews judges the piece the crowning masterpiece of Britten 's early years . By the time of Britten 's next cycle , Seven Sonnets of Michelangelo ( 1942 ) for tenor and piano , Pears had become his partner and muse ; in Matthews 's phrase , Britten wrote the cycle as \" his declaration of love for Peter \" . It too finds the sensuality of the verses it sets , though in its structure it resembles a conventional 19th @-@ century song cycle .

  "At the moment of touchdown , the spoiler lever was in the \" ARMED \" position . According to the system logic of the A320 's flight controls , in order for the spoilers to automatically deploy upon touchdown not only must the spoiler lever be in the \" ARMED \" position , but both thrust levers must be at or close to the \" idle \" position . The FDR transcript shows that immediately after the warning , the flight computer recorded the left thrust lever being retarded to the rear @-@ most position , activating the thrust reverser on the left engine , while the right thrust lever ( controlling the engine with the disabled thrust reverser ) remained in the CL position . One theory put forth by CENIPA is that the pilots may not have noticed that the right engine remained at CL because the Airbus autothrottle system , unlike other aircraft manufacturers , does not automatically move the levers when the autothrust controller changes engine settings . Therefore , the pilots may have thought that the right engine was at idle power without realizing that Airbus autothrust logic dictates that , when one or more of the thrust levers is pulled to the idle position , the autothrust is automatically disengaged . Thus , when the pilot pulled the left engine thrust lever to idle , it disconnected the autothrust system and the computer did not retard the right engine power to idle . Since the right engine thrust lever was still in the \" climb \" detent at that time , the right engine accelerated to climb power while the left engine deployed its thrust reverser . The resulting asymmetric thrust condition resulted in a loss of control and a crash ensued . The A320 's spoilers did not deploy during the landing run , as the right thrust lever was above the \" idle \" setting required for automatic spoiler deployment .",

  "Some of Chopin 's well @-@ known pieces have acquired descriptive titles , such as the Revolutionary Étude ( Op. 10 , No. 12 ) , and the Minute Waltz ( Op. 64 , No. 1 ) . However , with the exception of his Funeral March , the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number , leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener ; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others . There is no evidence to suggest that the Revolutionary Étude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind ; it merely appeared at that time . The Funeral March , the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 ( Op. 35 ) , the one case where he did give a title , was written before the rest of the sonata , but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it .",

  "The exact mass @-@ luminosity relationship depends on how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface . A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core , so the star does not need to produce as much energy to remain in hydrostatic equilibrium .

Note , however , that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection , which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium .",

  "Following her criticism of his extra @-@ marital affairs , Clarke 's father turned her out of the house and cut off her funds . She had to leave the Royal College in 1910 and supported herself through her viola playing . Clarke became one of the first female professional orchestral musicians when she was selected by Sir Henry Wood to play in the Queen 's Hall Orchestra in 1912 . In 1916 she moved to the United States to continue her performing career . A short , lyrical piece for viola and piano entitled Morpheus , composed under the pseudonym of \" Anthony Trent \" , was premiered at her 1918 joint recital with cellist May Muklé in New York City . Reviewers praised the \" Trent \" , largely ignoring the works credited to Clarke premiered in the same recital . Her compositional career peaked in a brief period , beginning with the viola sonata she entered in a 1919 competition sponsored by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge , Clarke 's neighbour and a patron of the arts . In a field of 72 entrants , Clarke 's sonata tied for first place with a composition by Ernest Bloch . Coolidge later declared Bloch the winner . Reporters speculated that \" Rebecca Clarke \" was only a pseudonym for Bloch himself , or at least that it could not have been Clarke who wrote these pieces , as the idea that a woman could write such a work was socially inconceivable . The sonata was well received and had its first performance at the Berkshire music festival in 1919 . In 1921 Clarke again made an impressive showing in Coolidge 's composition competition with her piano trio , though again failed to take the prize . A 1923 rhapsody for cello and piano followed , sponsored by Coolidge , making Clarke the only female recipient of Coolidge 's patronage . These three works represent the height of Clarke 's compositional career .",

It was built by Edward I during his invasion of Wales between 1282 and 1289 at the substantial cost of £ 8 @,@ 190 . Over the next few centuries , the castle played an important part in several wars , withstanding the siege of Madog ap Llywelyn between 1294 – 95 , but falling to Owain Glyndŵr in 1404 . It then became Glyndŵr 's residence and military headquarters for the remainder of the uprising until being recaptured by English forces in 1409 . During the 15th century Wars of the Roses , Harlech was held by the Lancastrians for seven years , before Yorkist troops forced its surrender in 1468 , a siege memorialised in the song Men of Harlech . Following the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642 , the castle was held by forces loyal to Charles I , holding out until 1647 when it became the last fortification to surrender to the Parliamentary armies . In the 21st century the ruined castle is managed by Cadw , the Welsh Government 's historic environment service , as a tourist attraction .",

  "The rubber vine could be destructively harvested by cutting up the vine and squeezing out the latex whilst it lay on the ground . This was quicker and easier than non @-@ destructive harvesting and was practised by villagers who wished to fill their quotas and avoid punishment , especially once supplies of the vine began to run low . In addition some vines were destroyed deliberately by villagers who believed that once the rubber was gone Abir would leave the concession . Because of this destruction all rubber vines within 10 km of Basankasu were depleted within 18 months of that post opening . In an attempt to slow the destruction of vines Abir issued orders in 1892 and 1904 which prohibited destructive harvesting methods but these were largely ineffective . In 1896 the Congo Free State ordered Abir to plant 150 rubber trees or vines for each ton of rubber exported to replace destructively harvested vines . This was increased to 500 plants per ton in 1902 . By 1903 the plantation at the Bongandanga post held more than one million plants and by 1904 each Abir post employed around one hundred workers to manage its plantation . Despite this the plantation project was ultimately a failure due in part to the fact that each Abir agent remained at a post for just two years and was uninterested in working the plantation which would only benefit his successor . Congo Free State forestry officers also noted that Abir plantations were smaller than required or even existed only on paper . Abir would also plant vines which looked similar to the Landolphia vine but did not produce rubber , as a consequence the Free State required them to instead plant the Clitandra vine which was more easily recognisable but did not produce rubber in its first eight years . These vines may never have reached maturity as there is no evidence that these plantations ever produced rubber . In 1904 Abir began to run out of vines to tap and rubber production fell to half of that of 1903 , which was 1000 tons . By 1904 rubber vines within 50 miles of Abir posts had been depleting , leading to violent clashes between rival villages over control of the remaining plants . The entirety of the Lulonga concession , to the west of Abir , produced just 7 tons of rubber in 1905 .",

  "The Welsh Springer Spaniel was also at one time called the Welsh Spaniel , and also at one point was included in the Kennel Club ( UK ) studbook as Cocker Spaniels , and was known as the Welsh Cocker . During the 19th century were several different varieties of Cocker Spaniel , including the English , the Welsh and the Devonshire as the term was used to describe the size of the dog rather than the breed . Unusually , in John George Wood 's 1865 book The Illustrated Natural History , an image is described showing a Welsh Cocker Spaniel as a solid coloured dark spaniel . The same inscription is used in the 1867 work The Dog in Health and Disease by Stonehenge and he further describes the Welsh Cocker and the Devonshire Cocker as \" both being of a deep @-@ liver colour \" . The Welsh Springer was relatively unknown during the 19th Century , but this changed in 1900 when Mr. A. T. Williams of Ynis @-@ y @-@ Gerwn won the team stake at the Sporting Spaniel Club Trials .

  "Livermorium is projected to be the fourth member of the 7p series of chemical elements and the heaviest member of group 16 ( VIA ) in the Periodic Table , below polonium . While it is the least theoretically studied of the 7p elements , its chemistry is expected to be quite similar to that of polonium . The group oxidation state of + 6 is known for all the chalcogens apart from oxygen which lacks available d @-@ orbitals for expansion of its octet and is itself one of the strongest oxidizing agents among the chemical elements . Oxygen is thus limited to a maximum + 2 state , exhibited in the fluoride OF2 . The + 4 state is known for sulfur , selenium , tellurium , and polonium , undergoing a shift in stability from reducing for sulfur ( IV ) and selenium ( IV ) through being the most stable state for tellurium ( IV ) to being oxidizing in polonium ( IV ) . This suggests a decreasing stability for the higher oxidation states as the group is descended due to the increasing importance of relativistic effects , especially the inert pair effect . The most stable oxidation state of livermorium should thus be + 2 , with a rather unstable + 4 state . The + 2 state should be about as easy to form as it is for beryllium and magnesium , and the + 4 state should only be achieved with strongly electronegative ligands , such as in livermorium ( IV ) fluoride ( LvF4 ) . The + 6 state should not exist at all due to the very strong stabilization of the 7s electrons , making the valence core of livermorium only four electrons . The lighter chalcogens are also known to form a − 2 state as oxide , sulfide , selenide , telluride , and polonide ; due to the destabilization of livermorium 's 7p3 / 2 subshell , the − 2 state should be very unstable for livermorium , whose chemistry should be essentially cationic , though the larger subshell and spinor energy splittings of livermorium as compared to polonium should stabilize Lv2 − slightly .",

  "If a star displays magnetic surface activity such as starspots , then these features can be tracked to estimate the rotation rate . However , such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes over the course of their life span , so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements . Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation , so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars .

  "Hoad finds the issue of national and racial identity central to Viking metal .

As an example , she cites the Brazilian band Viking Throne , which claims legitimacy through European ancestry and historical references to explorations of South America by Nordic countries .

In contrast to Viking Throne , she cites the band Slechtvalk , which is well known for its brand of Christian Viking metal , but yet goes largely without comment from the scene regarding its authenticity . Hoad speculates that the European ethnicity of the band is enough to compensate for its otherwise counter @-@ intuitive music .",

  "On May 26 , 2015 , a tropical wave traversed Central America and entered the Eastern Pacific . Little development occurred over the following few days as the system drifted westward .

  "Generally , people have fewer than 36 repeated glutamines in the polyQ region which results in production of the cytoplasmic protein Huntingtin . However , a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results in the production of a protein which has different characteristics . This altered form , called mutant huntingtin ( mHTT ) , increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons . Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons , and are affected accordingly . Generally , the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected , and accounts for about 60 % of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms . The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD . 36 – 39 repeats result in a reduced @-@ penetrance form of the disease , with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms . In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed .

  "Richard Fogle responded to the critical attack on Keats 's emphasis on rhyme and language put forth by Garrod , Gerard , and others in 1953 . His argument was similar to Brooks : that the poem was thematically coherent and that there is a poet within the poem that is different from Keats the writer of the poem . As such , Keats consciously chose the shift in the themes of the poem and the contrasts within the poem represent the pain felt when comparing the real world to an ideal world found within the imagination . Fogle also responded directly to the claims made by Leavis : \" I find Mr. Leavis too austere , but he points out a quality which Keats plainly sought for . His profusion and prodigality is , however , modified by a principle of sobriety . \" It is possible that Fogle 's statements were a defense of Romanticism as a group that was both respectable in terms of thought and poetic ability .

Forces contend wildly within the poem , not only without resolution , but without possibility of resolution ; and the reader comes away from his experience with the sense that he has been in ' a wild Abyss ' \" . He then explained , \" It is this turbulence , I suspect , that has led Allen Tate to believe the ode ' at least tries to say everything that poetry an say . ' But I propose it is the ' Ode on a Grecian Urn ' that succeeds in saying what poetry can say , and that the other ode attempts to say all that the poet can . \"",

  "For around two centuries after the conquest of Wales , the arrangements established by Edward I for the governance of the country remained in place . During this time the castle was constantly garrisoned , and Caernarfon was effectively the capital of north Wales . There was a degree of discrimination , with the most important administrative jobs in Wales usually closed to Welsh people . Tension between the Welsh and their English conquerors spilled over at the start of the 15th century with the outbreak of the Glyndŵr Rising ( 1400 – 1415 ) . During the revolt , Caernarfon was one of the targets of Owain Glyndŵr 's army . The town and castle were besieged in 1401 , and in November that year the Battle of Tuthill took place nearby between Caernarfon 's defenders and the besieging force . In 1403 and 1404 , Caernarfon was besieged by Welsh troops with support from French forces ; the garrison at the time was around thirty . The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne in 1485 heralded a change in the way Wales was administered . The Tudors were Welsh in origin , and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English . As a result , castles such as Caernarfon , which provided secure centres from which the country could be administered , became less important . They were neglected , and in 1538 it was reported that many castles in Wales were \" moche ruynous and ferre in decaye for lakke of tymely reparations \" .",

  "Supporters of the in situ theory believe that close to its present location organic matter accumulated near a peat bog and , shortly after burial , underwent permineralisation – minerals seeped into the organic matter and formed an internal cast . Water with a high dissolved mineral content was buried with the plant matter in a peat bog . As the dissolved ions crystallised , the mineral matter precipitated out . This caused concretions containing plant material to form and preserve as rounded lumps of stone . Coalification was thus prevented , and the peat was preserved and eventually became a coal ball .

  "Operationally , RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan ( SIOP ) to ensure coverage of all major Soviet targets from 1958 , 108 aircraft of the RAF 's V @-@ Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP by the end of 1959 . From 1962 onwards , two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert ( QRA ) . Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert , as this was identified as the amount of time between warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain . The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962 , where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3 , an increased state of preparedness from normal operations ; however , it stood down in early November .",
  "Taking a position against what it calls the \" pseudo @-@ secularism \" of the Congress party , the BJP instead supports \" positive secularism \" . Vajpayee laid out the BJP 's interpretation of Mahatma Gandhi 's doctrine of Sarva Dharma Sambhava and contrasted it with what he called European secularism . He had said that Indian secularism attempted to see all religions with equal respect , while European secularism was independent of religion , thus making the former more \" positive \" . The BJP supports a uniform civil code , which would apply a common set of personal laws to every citizen regardless of their personal religion , replacing the existing laws which vary by religious community . According to historian Yogendra Malik , this ignores the differential procedures required to protect the cultural identity of the Muslim minority . The BJP favours the abrogation of Article 370 of the Indian constitution , which grants a greater degree of autonomy to the Jammu and Kashmir in recognition of the unusual circumstances surrounding its accession to the Indian union .",
  "Within Oryzomyini , a 2006 phylogenetic analysis by Marcelo Weksler which used both morphological and DNA sequence data found some evidence that Oryzomys is most closely related to a group including Holochilus , Lundomys , and Pseudoryzomys . Although analyses based on morphological and combined data supported this relationship , sequences of the Rbp3 gene alone instead placed Oryzomys among a group that included Nectomys , Sigmodontomys , and a few other genera . In all analyses , Oryzomys appeared within clade D of Oryzomyini . The relationship between Oryzomys and the Holochilus group was supported by five synapomorphies ( shared derived characters ) — absence or reduction of both the hypothenar and interdigital pads ; reduction of ungual tufts of hairs surrounding the claws ; having the back margin of the zygomatic plate of the skull at the same level as the front of the first upper molar ; and the anterocone ( front cusp ) of the first upper molar divided by an anteromedian fossette . The first three are adaptations to the semiaquatic lifestyle that Oryzomys and the members of the Holochilus group share , and may thus be examples of convergent evolution .",

  "In Gary Pagett 's April 2002 monthly tropical cyclone summary , he noted a possible tropical cyclone over the southeast Pacific that displayed features of a tropical or subtropical cyclone . Operationally , the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington , New Zealand only issued gale warnings on the system as it was not assessed to have been tropical or subtropical . The system was later studied by Dr. Karl Hoarau of Cergy @-@ Pontoise University in France and is believed to have been a tropical storm . At the end of March , an upper @-@ level trough associated with a cold front developed over the southeast Pacific Ocean . By March 31 , a low @-@ level circulation had developed roughly 600 km ( 375 mi ) east of the Pitcairn Islands . Despite moderate wind shear , the system intensified and became a tropical depression early on April 1 . Owing to a subtropical ridge to the north , the depression tracked west @-@ southwestward into an area of decreased shear . Subsequently , the system was able to intensify into a tropical storm by the evening of April 2 . Though the storm remained shear , it quickly intensified throughout April 3 with convection remaining within half a degree of the center of circulation . During the evening hours , an eye @-@ like feature appeared on satellite imagery , and the system simultaneously was estimated to have reached its peak intensity as a strong tropical storm with one @-@ minute winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . Hours later , dry air became entrained in the storm 's circulation and caused it to rapidly weaken to a tropical depression . By the afternoon of April 4 , the low had become fully exposed and the system was no longer classified a tropical cyclone .",

  "The Caribbean initially provided England 's most important and lucrative colonies , but not before several attempts at colonisation failed . An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years , and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits . Colonies in St Lucia ( 1605 ) and Grenada ( 1609 ) also rapidly folded , but settlements were successfully established in St. Kitts ( 1624 ) , Barbados ( 1627 ) and Nevis ( 1628 ) . The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil , which depended on slave labour , and — at first — Dutch ships , to sell the slaves and buy the sugar . To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands , Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies . This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces — a series of Anglo @-@ Dutch Wars — which would eventually strengthen England 's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch .

  "Cornwallis , buoyed by the victory at Camden , then prepared to advance north into North Carolina while militia activity , led by Thomas Sumter and Francis Marion , continued to harass the troops he left in South Carolina . He detached Patrick Ferguson , his inspector of militia , to raise a company of militia in the hills of North and South Carolina and cover his left flank . Ferguson was zealous in execution of this assignment , raising nearly 1 @,@ 100 men . However , he angered many colonists by issuing threats to \" lay their country waste with fire and sword \" if they continued their opposition , and a Patriot militia arose to oppose him . While Ferguson recruited , Cornwallis moved his army to Charlotte , North Carolina , skirmishing with Patriot forces left there to harass his advance . Ferguson 's Loyalists and the Patriot militia , led by a coalition of commanders , clashed at Kings Mountain in early October , two weeks after Cornwallis arrived in Charlotte . The battle was a disaster : Ferguson was killed , and nearly his entire force was killed or captured . Kings Mountain was only about 35 miles ( 56 km ) from Charlotte , within Cornwallis 's range to assist . The defeat , combined with other failures to raise Loyalist militia and ongoing Patriot activity in South Carolina , prompted Cornwallis to retreat to Winnsboro , South Carolina , where he set up a winter camp . Attempts to capture either Marion or Sumter were repeatedly frustrated . To reinforce his army , he ordered Major General Alexander Leslie , stationed at Portsmouth , Virginia , to abandon that outpost and join him in South Carolina .",

  "Folklorist Gary R. Varner has suggested that the origin of the belief in water horses that preyed on and devoured humans may be a reflection of the human sacrifices once made to appease the gods of water . The association with horses may have its roots in horse sacrifices performed in ancient Scandinavia . Stories of malevolent water spirits served the practical purpose of keeping children away from perilous areas of water , and of warning adolescent women to be wary of attractive young strangers . The stories were also used to enforce moral standards , as they implied that the creatures took retribution for bad behaviour carried out on Sundays . The intervention of demons and spirits was possibly a way to rationalise the drowning of children and adults who had accidentally fallen into deep , fast flowing or turbulent water .",

  "Heterodimeric antibodies , which are also asymmetrical and antibodies , allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms . One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “ knobs @-@ into @-@ holes ” format . This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies . The “ knobs ” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one . It fits into the “ hole ” , which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one . What connects the “ knobs ” to the “ holes ” are the disulfide bonds between each chain . The “ knobs @-@ into @-@ holes ” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity . Single chain variable fragments ( scFv ) are connected to the variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide . The linker is rich in glycine , which gives it more flexibility , and serine / threonine , which gives it specificity . Two different scFv fragments can be connected together , via a hinge region , to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain . This gives the antibody bispecificity , allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens . The “ knobs @-@ into @-@ holes ” format enhances heterodimer formation but doesn ’ t suppress homodimer formation .",
