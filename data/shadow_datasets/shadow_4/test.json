  "Since the nascent Caliphate regarded itself as the heir of the Sassanid ( and to a lesser extent , Byzantine ) tradition and \" civilizational consciousness \" , the Arab caliphs also adopted the notion that , in the words of the historian Gerald Mako , it was their duty \" to protect the settled , i.e. the civilized world from the northern barbarian \" . To this imperative was added the Muslim concept of division of the world into the \" House of Islam \" ( Dar al @-@ Islam ) and the \" House of War \" ( Dar al @-@ Harb ) , to which the pagan Turkic nomads were consigned . The two armies consequently represented two different military philosophies . While the Umayyad armies disposed of a sizeable cavalry contingent , both light and heavy , their mainstay was the infantry , to the extent that in battle the Arab cavalry was often limited to skirmishing during the initial phases , before dismounting and fighting on foot . The Khazars on the other hand , although they had adopted elements of the civilizations of the south and possessed towns , remained a largely tribal and semi @-@ nomadic power . Like their Central Asian counterparts , they practiced a highly mobile form of warfare , relying on their highly skilled and hardy cavalry .

The eastern Caucasus range became the main theatre of the Arab – Khazar conflict , with the Arab armies aiming to gain control of Derbent ( known in Arabic as Bab al @-@ Abwab , \" Gate of Gates \" ) and the Khazar cities of Balanjar and Samandar , whose location has yet to be established with certainty by modern researchers .

The quantity of the TO weapons handed over in Istria — where the JNA evacuated 78 facilities — was enough to arm two combat brigades . In December 1991 , only minor clashes occurred around the JNA facilities that were still under the HV blockade , including a minor , unsuccessful HV attack on Mekušje barracks in Karlovac .

  "In 1991 , bodies believed to be those of the Imperial Family and their servants were finally exhumed from a mass grave in the woods outside Yekaterinburg . The grave had been found nearly a decade earlier , but was kept hidden by its discoverers from the Communists who still ruled Russia when the grave was originally found . Once the grave was opened , the excavators realized that instead of eleven sets of remains ( Tsar Nicholas II , Tsarina Alexandra , Tsarevitch Alexei , the four Grand Duchesses , Olga , Tatiana , Maria and Anastasia ; the family 's doctor , Yevgeny Botkin ; their valet , Alexei Trupp ; their cook , Ivan Kharitonov ; and Alexandra 's maid , Anna Demidova ) the grave held only nine . Alexei and , according to the late forensic expert Dr. William Maples , Anastasia were missing from the family 's grave . Russian scientists contested this , however , and claimed it was Maria 's body that was missing . The Russians identified Anastasia by using a computer program to compare photos of the youngest Grand Duchess with the skulls of the victims from the mass grave . They estimated the height and width of the skulls where pieces of bone were missing . American scientists found this method inexact . A Russian forensic expert said none of the skulls attributed to the Grand Duchesses had a gap between the front teeth as Maria did .",

  "The Statute of Monopolies was an Act of the Parliament of England notable as the first statutory expression of English patent law .

Nevertheless , officers conducted a traffic stop and discovered 30 pounds ( 14 kg ) of marijuana in the truck . At trial , the occupants of the car argued that the traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution , because the tip was unreliable , and officers did not personally observe criminal activity . Writing for a majority of the Court , Justice Clarence Thomas held that the 911 call was reliable , and that officers need not personally observe criminal activity when acting upon information provided by an anonymous 911 call .",

  "A significant precedent for Larsen 's depiction of Clare Kendry 's and Jack Bellew 's relationship was the 1925 legal trial known as the \" Rhinelander Case \" ( or Rhinelander v. Rhinelander ) . Wealthy , white Leonard Kip Rhinelander sued his wife , Alice Beatrice Jones , for annulment and fraud ; urged by his family , he alleged that she had failed to inform him of her \" colored \" blood . The case was also about status and class , as he had met her when she was working as a domestic . She contended that her mixed race was obvious and she had never denied it . Although the jury eventually returned a verdict for Alice , it came at a devastating social cost for both parties ; intimate exchanges between the couple were read out in court , and Alice Rhinelander was forced to partially disrobe in front of the jury in the judge 's chambers in order for them to assess the darkness of her skin .

  "The flavour has been described as nutty and slightly meaty , with a smooth , creamy texture , and a distinctive aroma reminiscent of sourdough . Young , small porcini are most appreciated by gourmets , as the large ones often harbour maggots ( insect larvae ) , and become slimy , soft and less tasty with age . Fruit bodies are collected by holding the stipe near the base and twisting gently . Cutting the stipe with a knife may risk the part left behind rotting and the mycelium being destroyed . Peeling and washing are not recommended . The fruit bodies are highly perishable , due largely to the high water content ( around 90 % ) , the high level of enzyme activity , and the presence of a flora of microorganisms . Caution should be exercised when collecting specimens from potentially polluted or contaminated sites , as several studies have shown that the fruit bodies can bioaccumulate toxic heavy metals like mercury , cadmium , caesium and polonium .

  "The Early Neolithic people of Britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears had done . Many archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead , believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants . Archaeologist Robin Holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs , the Medway Megaliths were \" communal mouments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them . \" Thus , it has furthermore been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs – which doubled as temples or shrines – to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance . For this reason , historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments \" tomb @-@ shrines \" to reflect their dual purpose .",

The assaults , which also occurred at the national monument 's Castle Rock Pueblo , were dated to c . 1280 , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites . Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures , and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe .

  "The significance of the concept of a Hilbert space was underlined with the realization that it offers one of the best mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics . In short , the states of a quantum mechanical system are vectors in a certain Hilbert space , the observables are hermitian operators on that space , the symmetries of the system are unitary operators , and measurements are orthogonal projections . The relation between quantum mechanical symmetries and unitary operators provided an impetus for the development of the unitary representation theory of groups , initiated in the 1928 work of Hermann Weyl . On the other hand , in the early 1930s it became clear that classical mechanics can be described in terms of Hilbert space ( Koopman – von Neumann classical mechanics ) and that certain properties of classical dynamical systems can be analyzed using Hilbert space techniques in the framework of ergodic theory .",

When the German government failed to meet their reparations payments and French troops marched in to occupy the industrial areas along the Ruhr in January 1923 , widespread civil unrest was the result . Hitler decided the time was ripe to attempt to seize control of the government with a coup d 'état modelled on Benito Mussolini 's 1922 March on Rome . Hess was with Hitler on the night of 8 November 1923 when he and the SA stormed a public meeting organised by Bavaria 's de facto ruler , Staatskommissar ( state commissioner ) Gustav von Kahr , in the Bürgerbräukeller , a large beer hall in Munich . Brandishing a pistol , Hitler interrupted Kahr 's speech and announced that the national revolution had begun , declaring the formation of a new government with World War I General Erich Ludendorff . The next day , Hitler and several thousand supporters attempted to march to the Ministry of War in the city centre . Gunfire broke out between the Nazis and the police ; fourteen marchers and four police officers were killed . Hitler was arrested on 11 November .",

This conversion reduced the area of the hookbill 's potential habitat , and is believed to be the biggest contributor to the species ' extinction . It has also been suggested that avian malaria , which began affecting Lānaʻi 's birds in the 1920s , may have contributed to the species ' decline .

  "In the Early Middle Ages , after the Roman Empire 's decline , the Adriatic 's coasts were ruled by Ostrogoths , Lombards and the Byzantine Empire . The Ostrogothic Kingdom ruled Italy following the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD . However , during the reign of Justinian the Byzantine Empire sent an army under the general Belisarius to regain control of Italy , resulting in the Gothic War ( 535 – 554 ) . The Byzantines established the Exarchate of Ravenna and by 553 AD their viceroy ( Exarch ) ruled almost the entire Italian peninsula from that city . In 568 AD the Lombards invaded northern Italy , and over the course of the next century or so the importance of the Exarchate declined as the territory under Lombard control expanded and as the Byzantine outpost of Venice became increasingly independent . In 752 AD the Lombards overthrew the Exarchate , ending the influence of the Byzantine Empire on the western shore of the Adriatic for a few centuries .",

  "Most observed white dwarfs have relatively high surface temperatures , between 8 @,@ 000 K and 40 @,@ 000 K. A white dwarf , though , spends more of its lifetime at cooler temperatures than at hotter temperatures , so we should expect that there are more cool white dwarfs than hot white dwarfs . Once we adjust for the selection effect that hotter , more luminous white dwarfs are easier to observe , we do find that decreasing the temperature range examined results in finding more white dwarfs . This trend stops when we reach extremely cool white dwarfs ; few white dwarfs are observed with surface temperatures below 4 @,@ 000 K , and one of the coolest so far observed , WD 0346 + 246 , has a surface temperature of approximately 3 @,@ 900 K.

People experience their lives against the backdrop of their culture , and while Hosseini wisely steers clear of merely exoticizing Afghanistan as a monolithically foreign place , he does so much work to make his novel emotionally accessible to the American reader that there is almost no room , in the end , for us to consider for long what might differentiate Afghans and Americans . \" Sarah Smith from The Guardian thought the novel started out well but began to falter towards the end .

  "Virtually nothing is known about Sviatoslav 's childhood and youth , which he spent reigning in Novgorod . Sviatoslav 's father , Igor , was killed by the Drevlians around 945 , and his mother , Olga , ruled as regent in Kiev until Sviatoslav reached maturity ( ca . 963 ) . Sviatoslav was tutored by a Varangian named Asmud . The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century . Sviatoslav appears to have had little patience for administration . His life was spent with his druzhina ( roughly , \" company \" ) in permanent warfare against neighboring states .

  "Critics have seen Jake as an ambiguous representative of Hemingway manliness . For example , in the bar scene in Paris , Jake is angry at some homosexual men . The critic Ira Elliot suggests that Hemingway viewed homosexuality as an inauthentic way of life , and that he aligns Jake with homosexual men because , like them , Jake does not have sex with women . Jake 's anger shows his self @-@ hatred at his inauthenticity and lack of masculinity . His sense of masculine identity is lost — he is less than a man . Elliot wonders if Jake 's wound perhaps signifies latent homosexuality , rather than only a loss of masculinity ; the emphasis in the novel , however , is on Jake 's interest in women . Hemingway 's writing has been called homophobic because of the language his characters use . For example , in the fishing scenes , Bill confesses his fondness for Jake but then goes on to say , \" I couldn 't tell you that in New York . It 'd mean I was a faggot . \"",

  "Jones also advocated for an amendment to the state constitution that had major implications for the governor 's office . Under the terms of the amendment , the lieutenant governor no longer became acting governor when the sitting governor left the state . It also allowed candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to run as a ticket instead of being elected on separate ballots . The centerpiece of the amendment , however , was the removal of the restriction on governors from succeeding themselves in office . The state constitution had previously barred the incumbent from seeking a second consecutive term ; under the new amendment , the sitting governor would be allowed to succeed himself once . Succession amendments had been proposed and defeated during the administrations of John Y. Brown , Jr. and Wallace Wilkinson , but Jones was able to see it passed because , unlike Brown and Wilkinson , he was willing to exempt the present incumbents , including himself , from the succession provision . Separate legislation passed during Jones ' term required a runoff election if no gubernatorial candidate won a majority in his or her party primary .

  "Widespread offshore and coastal evacuations took place along the United States Gulf Coast in preparation for Hurricane Bob . Effects from the hurricane on the United States were mostly marginal and typical of a minimal hurricane . The cyclone produced a moderate storm surge , damaging some coastal installments and causing coastal inundation .

The winds downed trees and blew out windows , in addition to causing widespread power outages . Heavy rainfall was also reported in some locations , peaking at 7 @.@ 16 in ( 182 mm ) in Louisiana . Further inland , the torrential rains led to flooding in Indiana , resulting in more considerable damage as opposed to the coast . Bob also spawned eight tornadoes , with two causing significant damage . Overall , Bob was responsible for one death and $ 20 million in damage .",

  "The redback is one of the few spider species that can be seriously harmful to humans , and its preferred habitat has led it to being responsible for the large majority of serious spider bites in Australia . Predominantly neurotoxic to vertebrates , the venom gives rise to the syndrome of latrodectism in humans ; this starts with pain around the bite site , which typically becomes severe and progresses up the bitten limb and persists for over 24 hours . Sweating in localised patches of skin occasionally occurs and is highly indicative of latrodectism . Generalised symptoms of nausea , vomiting , headache , and agitation may also occur and indicate severe poisoning . An antivenom has been available since 1956 , and there have been no deaths directly due to redback bites since its introduction .",

  "Neptune 's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating .

  "Points and lines may be viewed as special cases of circles ; a point can be considered as a circle of infinitely small radius , and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center is also at infinity . From this perspective , the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles . The nine other cases involving points and lines may be viewed as limiting cases of the general problem . These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem ; for example , the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions , since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent .",

His armed force initially consisted of his personal retinue , but ultimately became a much larger force consisting of many knights and other men who had previously not dared to confront the rebels . According to the historian Edgar Powell , Henry Dispenser undertook the task of dealing with the revolt in his diocese and punishing the rebels . He was involved in crushing rebellions at Peterborough and elsewhere , before moving on to suppress the revolts in Cambridge . The authorities were alerted to the call in Norfolk for men to join the revolt in the name of Litster . On 17 June the rebels from the north and east of the county assembled on Mousehold Heath , outside Norwich : shortly afterwards , Sir Robert Salle , who had come out of the city to speak with the commons , was killed .

The rebels then entered Norwich and wreaked havoc , destroying property and killing several prominent citizens . Other houses and church properties within the county ( such as at Yarmouth ) were attacked by the rebels at this time .",

  "Natural selection has played an enormous role in refining the wings , control and sensory systems , and anything else that affects aerodynamics or kinematics . One noteworthy trait is wing twist . Most insect wings are twisted , as are helicopter blades , with a higher angle of attack at the base . The twist generally is between 10 and 20 degrees . In addition to this twist , the wing surfaces are not necessarily flat or featureless ; most larger insects have wing membranes distorted and angled between the veins in such a way that the cross @-@ section of the wings approximates an airfoil . Thus , the wing 's basic shape already is capable of generating a small amount of lift at zero angle of attack ( see Insect wing ) . Most insects control their wings by adjusting tilt , stiffness , and flapping frequency of the wings with tiny muscles in the thorax ( below ) . Some insects evolved other wing features that are not advantageous for flight , but play a role in something else , such as mating or protection .",

  "As most meat ant colonies rarely have a second queen , polydomy is not always associated with polygyny , although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding . This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ . Studies show that most meat ants are produced by a single , inseminated queen due to the high level of relatedness in all but one tested colonies . Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion ( meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity ) . Meat ants also show nest fidelity : in polydomous colonies , workers from different nests will always mingle with others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from . Instead , they return to the nest they enclosed in . This means that colonies may only homogenise through brood transfer . As discussed before , nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other , but this is due to a number of factors : genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate with the level of aggression exhibited by the ants . However , they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories . They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies , suggesting that environmental cues play a vital role in nestmate recognition . An example is that background odours in a particular environment may impair ants from identifying their own nestmates , and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant 's identity .",

There is no contemporary evidence for Pain having held that office and nor is it likely , given Map 's story , that Pain was involved with Henry 's financial affairs ; rather it appears that if indeed he was a chamberlain , he was a body servant . Map relates a story about Pain serving the king personally at night , providing Henry with wine if the king called for it . The story continues that Pain once drank the wine and was caught out by Henry when the king subsequently demanded his nightcap . Map finishes the story by saying that the king then ordered that Pain should be given wine every night while awaiting the king 's pleasure . Although the story is unlikely to be true in all details , it suggests that Pain 's service to the king was personal as well as judicial and governmental . Other evidence against Map 's claim that Pain was a chamberlain is that he never attested a royal charter in that office .",

The actor discussed with Renwick how Jonathan may have developed in the intervening five years : \" We talked about whether he ’ d have changed , whether he ’ d have done any investigating in the meantime . He probably didn ’ t . He still does the same job and is locked in the same relationship with Klaus and feeling a bit put upon – that hasn ’ t changed at all ... and he still lives in a windmill \" . In a change from the original , Cobstone Windmill was used for the exterior shots , replacing Shipley Windmill , which had been used for all other episodes .

The winner , the Abzorbaloff was designed by nine @-@ year @-@ old William Grantham . Davies said of the monster , \" I thought the Abzorbaloff was brilliant . It touches people , absorbs them and their face actually appears in the body — terrifying . \" According to producer Phil Collinson , William was disappointed with the rendering of the monster because he had envisaged it being \" the size of a double @-@ decker bus \" , but the production team was never informed of this . Peter Kay had written a letter to Davies after the new series began in June 2005 , and Davies replied to him in September offering a guest spot in an episode . Kay was originally offered the part of Elton , but he felt the \" UFO @-@ spotter type \" was too similar to his character on Coronation Street and much preferred playing the \" baddie \" . The creature that Elton sees at the start of the episode is credited as the \" Hoix \" .

  "Shakespeare often used Raphael Holinshed 's Chronicles of England , Scotland , and Ireland — commonly known as Holinshed 's Chronicles — as a source for his plays , and in Macbeth he borrows from several of the tales in that work . Holinshed portrays Banquo as a historical figure : he is an accomplice in Mac Bethad mac Findlaích 's ( Macbeth 's ) murder of Donnchad mac Crínáin ( King Duncan ) and plays an important part in ensuring that Macbeth , not Máel Coluim mac Donnchada ( Malcolm ) , takes the throne in the coup that follows . Holinshed in turn used an earlier work , the Scotorum Historiae ( 1526 – 7 ) by Hector Boece , as his source . Boece 's work is the first known record of Banquo and his son Fleance ; and scholars such as David Bevington generally consider them fictional characters invented by Boece . In Shakespeare 's day , however , they were considered historical figures of great repute , and the king , James I , based his claim to the throne in part on a descent from Banquo . The House of Stuart was descended from Walter fitz Alan , the first High Steward of Scotland , and he was believed to have been the grandson of Fleance and Gruffydd ap Llywelyn 's daughter , Nesta verch Gruffydd .

  "The assertion ignited debate . Andrew Farke had in 2006 stressed that , apart from the frill , no systematic differences could be found between Torosaurus and Triceratops . He nevertheless disputed Scannella 's conclusion by arguing in 2011 that the proposed morphological changes required to \" age \" a Triceratops into a Torosaurus would be without precedent among ceratopsids . Creatures would require the growth of epoccipitals , reversion of bone texture from adult to immature forms back to adult , and growth of frill holes at a later stage than usual . A study by Nicholas Longrich and Daniel Field analyzed 35 specimens of both Triceratops and Torosaurus . The authors concluded that Triceratops individuals too old to be considered immature forms are represented in the fossil record , as are Torosaurus individuals too young to be considered fully mature adults . The synonymy of Triceratops and Torosaurus cannot be supported , they said , without more convincing intermediate forms than Scannella and Horner initially produced . Scannella 's Triceratops specimen with a hole on its frill , they argued , could represent a diseased or malformed individual rather than a transitional stage between an immature Triceratops and mature Torosaurus form .",

  "Hobbs toured Australia for a final time as a player in 1928 – 29 as part of a strong MCC team , and despite substantial scores in early games , did not bat well .

Australia were able to build up a substantial lead , and overnight rain before the sixth day of the match made them likely winners . England needed 332 to win , but on a pitch growing more difficult as it dried , a total of 100 was considered unlikely .

This Third Coalition , however , met the same fate as the First and Second Coalitions , collapsing in 1805 . The setbacks in Europe took a toll on Pitt 's health and he died in 1806 , reopening the question of who should serve in the ministry . Lord Grenville became Prime Minister , and his \" Ministry of All the Talents \" included Fox . The King was conciliatory towards Fox , after being forced to capitulate over his appointment . After Fox 's death in September 1806 , the King and ministry were in open conflict . To boost recruitment , the ministry proposed a measure in February 1807 whereby Roman Catholics would be allowed to serve in all ranks of the Armed Forces .

The ministers agreed to drop the measure then pending , but refused to bind themselves in the future . They were dismissed and replaced by the Duke of Portland as the nominal Prime Minister , with actual power being held by the Chancellor of the Exchequer , Spencer Perceval .

The complete prop was used to film the characters entering the wardrobe , while the other was in a different room for close @-@ up shots from \" within \" the wardrobe . For director David Kerr , the difficulty was sustaining the illusion that everything was happening in a single place , ideally without viewers even realising that there was a technical challenge involved . The episode was filmed mostly in sequence , meaning more actors arrived as the filming continued , reflecting the fact that more characters arrive as the episode progresses . Kerr aimed for a particularly \" immersive \" filming style on the episode , with extensive use of wide angle shots .

  "Neither Ralph of Coggeshall nor William of Newburgh offer an explanation for the \" strange and prodigious \" event , as William calls it , and some modern historians have the same reticence : \" I consider the process of worrying over the suggestive details of these wonderfully pointless miracles in an effort to find natural or psychological explanations of what ' really , ' if anything , happened , to be useless to the study of William of Newburgh or , for that matter , of the Middle Ages \" , says Nancy Partner , author of a study of 12th @-@ century historiography . Nonetheless , such explanations continue to be sought and two approaches have dominated explanations of the mystery of the green children . The first is that the narrative descends from folklore , describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of a \" fairy Otherworld \" . In a few early as well as modern readings , this other world is extraterrestrial , and the green children alien beings . The second is that it is a garbled account of a real event , although it is impossible to be certain whether the story as recorded is an authentic report given by the children or an \" adult invention \" . His study of accounts of children and servants fleeing from their masters led Charles Oman to conclude that \" there is clearly some mystery behind it all [ the story of the green children ] , some story of drugging and kidnapping \" . Jeffrey Jerome Cohen offers a different kind of historical explanation , arguing that the story is an oblique account of the racial difference between the contemporary English and the indigenous Britons .",

  "In a process known as the Marian reforms , Roman consul Gaius Marius carried out a programme of reform of the Roman military . In 107 BC , all citizens , regardless of their wealth or social class , were made eligible for entry into the Roman army . This move formalised and concluded a gradual process that had been growing for centuries , of removing property requirements for military service . The distinction between hastati , principes and triarii , which had already become blurred , was officially removed , and the legionary infantry of popular imagination was created . Legionary infantry formed a homogeneous force of heavy infantry . These legionaries were drawn from citizen stock ; by this time , Roman or Latin citizenship had been regionally expanded over much of ancient Italy and Cisalpine Gaul . Lighter citizen infantry , such as the velites and equites , were replaced by non @-@ citizen auxilia that could consist of foreign mercenaries . Due to the concentration of the citizen legions into a force of heavy infantry Rome 's armies depended on auxiliary cavalry attachments for support . As a tactical necessity , legions were almost always accompanied by an equal or greater number of lighter auxiliary troops , which were drawn from the non @-@ citizens of the Empire 's territories . One known exception of legions being formed from non @-@ citizen provinces during this period was the legion that was raised in the province of Galatia .",

The A.V. Club echoed the misgivings about Samus 's immaturity , petulant behavior , and misguided loyalty . According to GamePro , while the story and Samus ' monologues did not compel them , \" it helped contextualize her entire existence \" which developed the character to \" an actual human being who 's using the vastness of space to try and put some distance between herself and the past . \" 1UP.com 's Justin Hayward found the portrayal \" lifeless and boring \" and \" nonsensical \" . GamesRadar wrote that Other M painted Samus , widely considered a strong female lead character , as \" an unsure , insecure woman who desperately wants the approval of her former [ male ] commanding officer . \" Game Informer listed her 1st on their list of the top ten \" dorks \" of 2010 , citing her \" lame backstory \" in Other M.

  "At partial pressures of oxygen of 2 to 3 bar ( 200 to 300 kPa ) — 100 % oxygen at 2 to 3 times atmospheric pressure — these symptoms may begin as early as 3 hours after exposure to oxygen . Experiments on rats breathing oxygen at pressures between 1 and 3 bars ( 100 and 300 kPa ) suggest that pulmonary manifestations of oxygen toxicity may not be the same for normobaric conditions as they are for hyperbaric conditions . Evidence of decline in lung function as measured by pulmonary function testing can occur as quickly as 24 hours of continuous exposure to 100 % oxygen , with evidence of diffuse alveolar damage and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome usually occurring after 48 hours on 100 % oxygen . Breathing 100 % oxygen also eventually leads to collapse of the alveoli ( atelectasis ) , while — at the same partial pressure of oxygen — the presence of significant partial pressures of inert gases , typically nitrogen , will prevent this effect .",

  "Most of Clarke 's time in England was during the Interregnum when there was no monarch . King Charles I had been executed in 1649 , and his successor , Charles II , did not assume the throne until 1660 . During the intervening period , rule of the country was largely under Parliament or Oliver Cromwell as the Lord Protector . Cromwell wrote a letter to Rhode Island in 1655 , mostly concerning difficulties with France , but he also confirmed the continued validity of Rhode Island 's 1643 patent . While Clarke 's primary purpose in England was to secure a strengthened charter for the Rhode Island colony , one ensuring religious liberties , the relative chaos of England at the time did not offer an opportunity for doing so . Nevertheless , Clarke did assist the colony in 1656 by sending four barrels of powder and eight barrels of shot and bullets , and in 1657 he handled a letter from the colony requesting assistance with legal proceedings against William Harris .",

Himmler stated that the Swedes were the \" epitome of the Nordic spirit and the Nordic man \" , and looked forward to incorporating central and southern Sweden to the Germanic Empire . Himmler offered northern Sweden , with its Finnish minority , to Finland , along with the Norwegian port of Kirkenes , although this suggestion was rejected by Finnish Foreign Minister Witting . Felix Kersten , claimed that Himmler had expressed regret that Germany had not occupied Sweden during Operation Weserübung , but was certain that this error was to be rectified after the war . In April 1942 , Goebbels expressed similar views in his diary , writing that Germany should have occupied the country during its campaign in the north , as \" this state has no right to national existence anyway \" . In 1940 , Hermann Göring suggested that Sweden 's future position in the Reich was similar to that of Bavaria in the German Empire . The ethnically Swedish Åland Islands , which were awarded to Finland by the League of Nations in 1921 , were likely to join Sweden in the Germanic Empire . In the spring of 1941 , the German military attaché in Helsinki reported to his Swedish counterpart that Germany would need transit rights through Sweden for the imminent invasion of the Soviet Union , and in the case of finding her cooperative would permit the Swedish annexation of the islands .

  "Many Byzantines feared the Crusade , a view endorsed by the numerous acts of vandalism and theft practiced by the unruly armies as they marched through Byzantine territory . Byzantine troops followed the Crusaders , attempting to police their behaviour , and further troops were assembled in Constantinople , ready to defend the capital against any acts of aggression . This cautious approach was well advised , but still the numerous incidents of covert and open hostility between the Franks and the Greeks on their line of march , for which it seems both sides were to blame , precipitated conflict between Manuel and his guests . Manuel took the precaution – which his grandfather had not taken – of making repairs to the city walls , and he pressed the two kings for guarantees concerning the security of his territories .

  "The trial began in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with three days of testimony from MacMillan . Brownlee 's lawyer , Arthur LeRoy Smith , used his cross examination to call into question almost everything MacMillan said . To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton , he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs , dated before she had even met Brownlee . He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction , which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton , the city had been engulfed in a blizzard . Moreover , the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until more than a year after that date . In response to her testimony that she had always slept in the maid 's room while staying with the Brownlees , Smith produced letters showing that she had actually slept in Mrs. Brownlee 's room . After MacMillan conceded her mistake , Smith noted that Mrs. Brownlee 's room had a large deadbolt on the door : if she had feared Brownlee , why had she not used it ? \" Because I just did as Mr. Brownlee said , \" was the plaintiff 's response . MacMillan , when questioned , admitted that the period during which she had been staying in the Brownlee home in the spring of 1932 , which she had initially placed at six weeks , was actually only four . When she identified these four weeks as the last two weeks of April and the first two of May , Smith showed that Brownlee had been out of town for all but ten nights of that period .",

  "The Western Chalukya dynastic rule ended in the late 12th century , but its architectural legacy was inherited by the temple builders in southern Karnataka , a region then under the control of the Hoysala empire .

The construction of the Chennakesava Temple at Belur was the first major project commissioned by Hoysala King Vishnuvardhana in 1117 CE . This temple best exemplifies the Chalukyan taste the Hoysala artisans inherited . Avoiding overdecoration , these artists left uncarved spaces where required , although their elaborate doorjambs are exhibitionistic . Here , on the outer walls , the sculptures are not overdone , yet they are articulate and discreetly aesthetic .

Thus the main formal structure of their work is that the Senate refers something to a committee for examination , and the committee reports back to the Senate on that matter . These reports are tabled during parliamentary sittings , but can also be presented when the Senate is not in session . Committees can gather evidence and will often hold public hearings to assist this process . To gather their evidence committees can ( with exceptions ) travel from place to place to hear evidence . Committees are able to order the production of documents and the appearance of witnesses ( powers that are in practice used very sparingly ) . Most evidence taken by committees ( both written submissions and transcripts of public hearings ) is published , however committees have the power to take evidence confidentially ( in camera ) , and regularly do so .

  "Ibrahim II then briefly named his own son as governor , before the appointment of the Sicilian Husayn ibn Rabah . Husayn renewed the campaigns against the remaining Byzantine strongholds in the northeast , especially Taormina , in 879 – 880 , but without success . Indeed , the Byzantines were able to launch a limited counteroffensive in 880 , when the admiral Nasar defeated an Aghlabid fleet in a daring night attack in the Ionian Sea , and then proceeded to raid the environs of Palermo , before defeating another Aghlabid fleet at the Battle of Stelai . In 881 – 882 , Taormina was again the target of a determined Muslim attack , but held out , and a Muslim army under Abu 'l @-@ Thawr was annihilated by the Byzantines , causing a large @-@ scale mobilization of the Sicilian Muslims .

  "Rolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars . Reviewer Jim DeRogatis praised the album as \" one of the rare epic rock releases whose bulk is justified in the grooves \" .

  "Konami video game developer Tomm Hulett described Kefka as a pure villain , stating \" Unlike most Japanese stories , Kefka did not have shades of gray . He didn 't have a tragic past that turned him into a sadistic clown that you felt sorry for him over . He didn 't have some greater purpose that he lost sight of . Yet , at the same time , he wasn 't ' evil for evil 's sake . ' There was something twisted and nasty inside him that MADE him that way ... and you could feel it ... but you also knew there wasn 't any good in there . \" That he is a central villain of the entire game also serves to intensify a players negative fixation on him . In a review of Final Fantasy VI Advance , IGN stated \" it 's the game 's maniacal nihilist Kefka that really stands out . The most evil and destructive villain in the entire Final Fantasy franchise , Kefka 's brutality and ruthlessness is unmatched and he has to be seen to be believed . \" IGN also noted his ability to \" tap into primal , instinctive fears \" , including fears of clowns . CNet in their own review described him as \" the unrivaled star of the show ... he 's the kind of villain that you will love to hate \" , comparing him to Jack Nicholson 's portrayal of the Joker and calling his laugh one of the greatest sound effects in any video game . Kotaku has called Kefka the greatest video game villain of all time , and attempted to explain players ' lasting fascination by noting that he inspires such hatred that when his evil plans are finally thwarted , the sense of joy from victory is so much the greater . GameSpy compared Kefka 's final form as a representation of Lucifer , highlighted by his powerful \" Fallen Angel \" attack . Another theory posited by GameSpot is that the intense reaction to Kefka stems from the fact that he is one of the few villains in Final Fantasy , or any game , that succeeds at his master plan before he is defeated .",

In 2000 , primatologist B.S.

  "A very well understood example of extrinsic control is the regulation of glucose metabolism by the hormone insulin . Insulin is produced in response to rises in blood glucose levels . Binding of the hormone to insulin receptors on cells then activates a cascade of protein kinases that cause the cells to take up glucose and convert it into storage molecules such as fatty acids and glycogen . The metabolism of glycogen is controlled by activity of phosphorylase , the enzyme that breaks down glycogen , and glycogen synthase , the enzyme that makes it . These enzymes are regulated in a reciprocal fashion , with phosphorylation inhibiting glycogen synthase , but activating phosphorylase . Insulin causes glycogen synthesis by activating protein phosphatases and producing a decrease in the phosphorylation of these enzymes .",

  "The song was written and recorded during the album 's sessions at Windmill Lane Studios and The Factory Studios in Dublin , between legs of the Zoo TV Tour from March to May 1993 . \" Zooropa \" was first developed after The Edge listened to cassette recordings of the band 's soundchecks from the tour .

The song 's introduction was recorded separately from the remainder of the song . The band based the introduction on a jam session in the studio , and producer Flood took parts of the jam and created an ambient mix . The bass guitar during the intro was written and performed by drummer Larry Mullen , Jr . , who came up with the piece during the recording sessions while The Edge was working on the album 's guitar riffs .

  "His brother Howard Burnham ( 1870 – 1918 ) , born shortly before the family moved to Los Angeles , lost one leg at the age of 14 and suffered from tuberculosis . During his teenage years he lived with Fred in California and learned from his brother the art of Scoutcraft , how to shoot , and how to ride the range , all in spite of his wooden leg .

  "The terms profess , practise and propagate are not defined in the Constitution , but cases from Singapore and other jurisdictions may shed light on their meaning . The word profess in relation to a religion was defined in a 1964 Singapore case not involving the Constitution as meaning \" to affirm , or declare one 's faith in or allegiance to \" . A 2001 Malaysian decision suggested that the profession of religion does not encompass the renunciation of a religion or the profession of an irreligious viewpoint . As regards the word propagate , in 1977 the Supreme Court of India held that it confers on an individual the right to transmit or spread his or her religion by an exposition of its tenets , but not the right to convert another person who holds a pre @-@ existing religious belief to one 's own religion . These issues have not yet come before the Singapore courts for determination . On the other hand , in 1999 the Court of Appeal attempted to draw a line between religious practices and secular facts , taking the view that singing the National Anthem and saying the National Pledge were the latter . Thus , rules that compelled a teacher to engage in these activities in an educational institution could not be regarded as having infringed his right to practise his religion .",

The depiction actually remained stylised : Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the \" worst image for stark violence \" when a Japanese soldier beheads an American : the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream , yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off . Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic , psychologically it may not have been . The wartime audience was , she points out , well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded .",

  "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman was written against the tumultuous background of the French Revolution and the debates that it spawned in Britain . In a lively and sometimes vicious pamphlet war , now referred to as the Revolution Controversy , British political commentators addressed topics ranging from representative government to human rights to the separation of church and state , many of these issues having been raised in France first . Wollstonecraft first entered this fray in 1790 with A Vindication of the Rights of Men , a response to Edmund Burke 's Reflections on the Revolution in France ( 1790 ) . In his Reflections , Burke criticised the view of many British thinkers and writers who had welcomed the early stages of the French revolution . While they saw the revolution as analogous to Britain 's own Glorious Revolution in 1688 , which had restricted the powers of the monarchy , Burke argued that the appropriate historical analogy was the English Civil War ( 1642 – 1651 ) in which Charles I had been executed in 1649 . He viewed the French revolution as the violent overthrow of a legitimate government . In Reflections he argues that citizens do not have the right to revolt against their government because civilisation is the result of social and political consensus ; its traditions cannot be continually challenged — the result would be anarchy . One of the key arguments of Wollstonecraft 's Rights of Men , published just six weeks after Burke 's Reflections , is that rights cannot be based on tradition ; rights , she argues , should be conferred because they are reasonable and just , regardless of their basis in tradition .",

  "Pilot whales generally take several breaths before diving for a few minutes . Feeding dives may last over ten minutes .

British Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery favoured a single thrust north over the branches of the Lower Rhine River , allowing the British Second Army to bypass the Siegfried Line and attack the Ruhr . To this end , the Allies launched Operation Market Garden on 17 September . Airborne troops were dropped in the Netherlands to secure key bridges and towns along the Allied axis of advance . Farthest north , the British 1st Airborne Division , supported by men of the Glider Pilot Regiment and the 1st Polish Parachute Brigade , landed at Arnhem to secure bridges across the Nederrijn .

  "In Ancient Roman times , a new Roman mythology was born through syncretization of numerous Greek and other foreign gods . This occurred because the Romans had little mythology of their own and inheritance of the Greek mythological tradition caused the major Roman gods to adopt characteristics of their Greek equivalents . The gods Zeus and Jupiter are an example of this mythological overlap . In addition to the combination of the two mythological traditions , the association of the Romans with eastern religions led to further syncretizations . For instance , the cult of Sun was introduced in Rome after Aurelian 's successful campaigns in Syria . The Asiatic divinities Mithras ( that is to say , the Sun ) and Ba 'al were combined with Apollo and Helios into one Sol Invictus , with conglomerated rites and compound attributes . Apollo might be increasingly identified in religion with Helios or even Dionysus , but texts retelling his myths seldom reflected such developments . The traditional literary mythology was increasingly dissociated from actual religious practice . The worship of Sol as special protector of the emperors and of the empire remained the chief imperial religion until it was replaced by Christianity .",

  "Kantakouzenos responded by having himself declared emperor at Didymoteicho in October 1341 , while his opponents followed with the coronation of John V in November . The two coronations finalized the split , and ushered in a civil war that would embroil the Byzantine Empire and all of its neighbours until 1347 with Kantakouzenos 's victory . In its course , it would devastate the remaining imperial possessions , and create a deep rift in Byzantine society : the aristocracy and the propertied classes generally supported Kantakouzenos , while the lower and middle classes , primarily urban , as well as the merchants and sailors , supported Apokaukos and the regency . This gave the dynastic dispute and civil war strong social overtones : during the war , the excessive wealth and perceived indifference of Kantakouzenos and the aristocracy towards the common people became a standard fixture of Apokaukos 's propaganda .

  "Despite his critical comments , Thucydides admits in a short digression that \" publicly his conduct of the war was as good as could be desired \" .

On the other hand , Paparrigopoulos believes that the Sicilian Expedition , prompted by Alcibiades , was a strategic mistake . In agreement with Paparrigopoulos , Platias and Koliopoulos underscore the fact that the Sicilian expedition was a strategic blunder of the first magnitude , resulting from a \" frivolous attitude and an unbelievable underestimation of the enemy \" .

Vlachos asserts that Alcibiades had already conceived a broader plan : the conquest of the whole West . He intended to conquer Carthage and Libya , then to attack Italy and , after winning these , to seize Italy and Peloponnesus . The initial decision of the ecclesia provided however for a reasonable military force , which later became unreasonably large and costly because of Nicias 's demands .

  "The female 's preference for the male mate has also been examined , in accordance to the male 's size and fighting ability . The female cichlid always chooses the larger of the two males if the smaller male is next to the larger male , and if the larger male defeats the smaller male in a fight . If the males are not viewed together at the same time for a comparison to be drawn by the female , the female has no particular preference . Females do benefit by mating with a larger male , as it has been shown that larger males can raise more offspring to independence , are better at chasing predators that might attack offspring , and are better at competing for breeding sites . Male size may act as a more effective indicator of aggression , which may thus repel intruders before they can come closer to the offspring . It has been shown that individuals of significantly greater size relative to their opponent often win fights without much physical contact. convict cichlid are one of easiest cichlid to breed and keep",

  "This inclusion of the fantastic , however , is mostly a framework by which the author discusses human nature and society . One critic suggests that \" the story would be much the same without it \" . Balzac had used supernatural elements in the potboiler novels he published under noms de plume , but their presence in Peau de chagrin signaled a turning point in his approach to the use of symbolism . Whereas he had used fantastic objects and events in earlier works , they were mostly simple plot points or uncomplicated devices for suspense . With La Peau de chagrin , on the other hand , the talisman represents Valentin 's soul ; at the same time , his demise is symbolic of a greater social decline . Balzac 's real foci in the 1831 novel are the power of human desire and the nature of society after the July Revolution . French writer and critic Félicien Marceau even suggests that the symbolism in the novel allows a purer analysis than the individual case studies of other Balzac novels ; by removing the analysis to an abstract level , it becomes less complicated by variations of individual personality . As an everyman , Valentin displays the essential characteristics of human nature , not a particular person 's approach to the dilemma offered by the skin .",

  "Where Rimsky @-@ Korsakov changed between these two sets of works was in orchestration . While his pieces were always celebrated for their imaginative use of instrumental forces , the sparser textures of Sadko and Antar pale compared to the luxuriance of the more popular works of the 1880s . While a principle of highlighting \" primary hues \" of instrumental color remained in place , it was augmented in the later works by a sophisticated cachet of orchestral effects , some gleaned from other composers including Wagner , but many invented by himself . As a result , these works resemble brightly colored mosaics , striking in their own right and often scored with a juxtaposition of pure orchestral groups . The final tutti of Scheherazade is a prime example of this scoring . The theme is assigned to trombones playing in unison , and is accompanied by a combination of string patterns . Meanwhile , another pattern alternates with chromatic scales in the woodwinds and a third pattern of rhythms is played by percussion .",

  "Tsuchida 's concept for the battle system was to maintain the strategic nature of command @-@ based battles . The system stemmed from a desire to create battles similar to those found in the film Final Fantasy VII : Advent Children . Magic points ( MP ) , which had been a part of the battle system in previous Final Fantasy titles , were removed in the game 's battle system as Tsuchida and the other designers felt that it gave players an incentive to not use their most powerful magic attacks due to the MP cost , in turn making battles less interesting . The Paradigm system was designed early in the battle system 's development , with the intent of making battles rely on quickly changing strategies and feel fast @-@ moving . Originally there were only five roles , but the Saboteur was later added as the designers felt that its abilities were missing from the game and did not fit with the other roles . Together with the maximum of three characters in a combat situation , the groupings of enemies were designed to force the player to switch Paradigms to keep them engaged in the battles .",

  "By 1774 , canal building was much better understood , and a new attempt was made . The plan was led by Dallaway 's son William , who asked Thomas Dadford , Jr . , the engineer on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and John Priddy , who had been the engineer on the Droitwich Canal during its construction , to carry out a survey . The cost of a canal which avoided the river and hence the mills , was put at £ 16 @,@ 750 , and soon £ 20 @,@ 000 had been raised .

  "To physicians of the time , the appropriate treatment for \" apparent death \" was warmth and stimulation . Anne Greene , a woman sentenced to death and hanged in 1650 for the supposed murder of her stillborn child , was found by anatomists to be still alive . They revived her by pouring hot cordial down her throat , rubbing her limbs and extremities , bleeding her , applying heating plasters and a \" heating odoriferous Clyster to be cast up in her body , to give heat and warmth to her bowels . \" After placing her in a warm bed with another woman , to keep her warm , she recovered fully and was pardoned . Artificial respiration and the blowing of smoke into the lungs or the rectum were thought to be interchangeably useful , but the smoke enema was considered the most potent method , due to its supposed warming and stimulating properties . The Dutch experimented with methods of inflating the lungs , as a treatment for those who had fallen into their canals and apparently drowned . Patients were also given rectal infusions of tobacco smoke , as a respiratory stimulant . Richard Mead was among the first Western scholars to recommend tobacco smoke enemas to resuscitate victims of drowning , when in 1745 he recommended tobacco glysters to treat iatrogenic drowning caused by immersion therapy . His name was cited in one of the earliest documented cases of resuscitation by rectally applied tobacco smoke , from 1746 , when a seemingly drowned woman was treated . On the advice of a passing sailor , the woman 's husband inserted the stem of the sailor 's pipe into her rectum , covered the bowl with a piece of perforated paper , and \" blew hard \" . The woman was apparently revived . In the 1780s the Royal Humane Society installed resuscitation kits , including smoke enemas , at various points along the River Thames , and by the turn of the 19th century , tobacco smoke enemas had become an established practice in Western medicine , considered by Humane Societies to be as important as artificial respiration .",

  "The diploid nature of chromosomes allows for genes on different chromosomes to assort independently or be separated from their homologous pair during sexual reproduction wherein haploid gametes are formed . In this way new combinations of genes can occur in the offspring of a mating pair . Genes on the same chromosome would theoretically never recombine . However , they do via the cellular process of chromosomal crossover . During crossover , chromosomes exchange stretches of DNA , effectively shuffling the gene alleles between the chromosomes . This process of chromosomal crossover generally occurs during meiosis , a series of cell divisions that creates haploid cells .",

  "British banker and naturalist Walter Rothschild first described the long @-@ tailed ground roller in 1895 , giving it the scientific name Uratelornis chimaera ; Rothschild published his description in Novitates Zoologicae , the periodical of his private museum . The adaptations required for the ancestral long @-@ tailed ground roller to inhabit scrubland led Rothschild to create the monotypic genus Uratelornis for the species in his description . The genus name Uratelornis is derived from the Ancient Greek word oura \" tail , \" and atelornis in reference to another genus of ground roller .

The long @-@ tailed ground roller is placed in the ground roller family , which gets its common name due to its similarity to the rollers and its largely terrestrial nature . Until recently the ground rollers , cuckoo roller , and rollers were all placed in a single family , Coraciidae , in which each of the three groups formed a subfamily . In 1971 , Joel Cracraft proposed a separate family for the ground rollers based on significant differences in behavior , plumage , and post @-@ cranial anatomy between the groups .

  "The early Church Fathers believed there was only one Jewish – Christian gospel , perhaps in different versions ; however , scholars have long recognized the possibility there were at least two or three . Jerome 's references to a Gospel of the Hebrews , or variants of that name , are particularly problematic because it is unclear which gospel he is referring to as the source of his quotations . Hegesippus , Eusebius , and Jerome all used an Aramaic gospel , which Jerome referred to as the gospel used by a Jewish Christian sect known as the Nazarenes . Gospel of the Nazarenes is the name adopted by scholars to describe the fragments of quotations believed to originate from an Aramaic gospel that was based on traditions similar to the Gospel of Matthew . A third gospel was known only to Epiphanius of Salamis , which he attributed to a second Jewish Christian group known as the Ebionites . Scholars have conventionally referred to seven fragments of a Greek gospel harmony preserved in quotations by Epiphanius as the Gospel of the Ebionites . The existence of three independent Jewish – Christian gospels with distinct characteristics has been regarded as an established consensus . However , that conclusion has recently been challenged with respect to the composition of the gospel known to the Nazarenes and its relationship to the Gospel of the Hebrews . The relationship between the Gospel of the Hebrews and the other Jewish – Christian gospels , as well as a hypothetical original Hebrew Gospel , is uncertain and has been an ongoing subject of scholarly investigation .",

  "Edward Alphonso Goldman revised North American Oryzomys in 1918 and consolidated many forms into a single species Oryzomys couesi , with ten subspecies distributed from southern Texas and western Mexico south to Costa Rica .

  "In 1948 , shortly after applying for the position in Melbourne , Woodruff moved from Sheffield to the University of Aberdeen where he was given a post as a senior lecturer , having not known where the Scottish city was beforehand . At Aberdeen , Woodruff was given better laboratory access under Professor Bill Wilson , and was also awarded a grant that allowed his wife to be paid for her services . He took advantage of this access and his wife 's skills as a lab assistant to investigate in utero grafts ( tissue grafts performed while the recipient was still in the womb ) . At the time , the surgical community hypothesized that if a recipient were given in utero grafts , he would be able to receive tissue from the donor later in life without risk of rejection . Woodruff 's experiments with rats , however , produced negative results . Woodruff also commenced work on antilymphocyte serum for immunosuppression , with little initial success .",

If the female is not ready to mate , she runs away and circles in the reverse direction . Pregnant females leave the herd for a week , give birth to the calf and conceive again during their postpartum estrus ; thus they can produce a calf a year . Gestation lasts about nine months , after which a single calf is born , weighing 20 to 33 pounds ( 9 @.@ 1 to 15 @.@ 0 kg ) .

  "From the 1980s Scottish literature enjoyed another major revival , particularly associated with a group of Glasgow writers focused around meetings in the house of critic , poet and teacher Philip Hobsbaum . Also important in the movement was Peter Kravitz , editor of Polygon Books . Members of the group that would come to prominence as writers included James Kelman , Alasdair Gray , Liz Lochhead , Tom Leonard and Aonghas MacNeacail . In the 1990s major , prize @-@ winning , Scottish novels that emerged from this movement included Irvine Welsh 's Trainspotting ( 1993 ) , Warner 's Morvern Callar ( 1995 ) , Gray 's Poor Things ( 1992 ) and Kelman 's How Late It Was , How Late ( 1994 ) . These works were linked by a sometimes overtly political reaction to Thatcherism that explored marginal areas of experience and used vivid vernacular language ( including expletives and Scots dialect ) . Scottish crime fiction has been a major area of growth with the success of novelists including Val McDermid , Frederic Lindsay , Christopher Brookmyre , Quintin Jardine , Denise Mina and particularly the success of Edinburgh 's Ian Rankin and his Inspector Rebus novels .

  "The Second Crusade was announced by Pope Eugene III , and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings , namely Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany , with help from a number of other European nobles .
