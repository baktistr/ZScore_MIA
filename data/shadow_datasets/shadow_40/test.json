  "Contemporary critics were largely positive .

  "Following the appropriation of the hymn in secular music , \" Amazing Grace \" became such an icon in American culture that it has been used for a variety of secular purposes and marketing campaigns , placing it in danger of becoming a cliché . It has been mass @-@ produced on souvenirs , lent its name to a Superman villain , appeared on The Simpsons to demonstrate the redemption of a murderous character named Sideshow Bob , incorporated into Hare Krishna chants and adapted for Wicca ceremonies . It can also be sung to the theme from The Mickey Mouse Club and to many other popular songs , as Garrison Keillor has observed . The hymn has been employed in several films , including Alice 's Restaurant , Coal Miner 's Daughter , and Silkwood . It is referenced in the 2006 film Amazing Grace , which highlights Newton 's influence on the leading British abolitionist William Wilberforce , and in the upcoming film biography of Newton , Newton 's Grace . The 1982 science fiction film Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan used \" Amazing Grace \" amid a context of Christian symbolism , to memorialize Mr. Spock following his death , but more practically , because the song has become \" instantly recognizable to many in the audience as music that sounds appropriate for a funeral \" according to a Star Trek scholar . Since 1954 when an organ instrumental of \" New Britain \" became a bestseller , \" Amazing Grace \" has been associated with funerals and memorial services . It has become a song that inspires hope in the wake of tragedy , becoming a sort of \" spiritual national anthem \" according to authors Mary Rourke and Emily Gwathmey . For example , President Barack Obama recited and then sang the hymn at the memorial service for Clementa Pinckney , one of the victims of the 2015 Charleston church shooting .",

  "Lieutenant Colonel Smith , concerned about the safety of his men , sent flankers to follow a ridge and protect his forces from the roughly 1 @,@ 000 colonials now in the field as the British marched east out of Concord . This ridge ended near Meriam 's Corner , a crossroads about a mile ( 2 km ) outside the village of Concord , where the main road came to a bridge across a small stream . To cross the narrow bridge , the British had to pull the flankers back into the main column and close ranks to a mere three soldiers abreast . Colonial militia companies arriving from the north and east had converged at this point , and presented a clear numerical advantage over the regulars . The British were now witnessing once again what General Gage had hoped to avoid by dispatching the expedition in secrecy and in the dark of night : the ability of the colonial militiamen to rise and converge by the thousands when British forces ventured out of Boston . As the last of the British column marched over the narrow bridge , the British rear guard wheeled and fired a volley at the colonial militiamen , who had been firing irregularly and ineffectively from a distance but now had closed to within musket range . The colonists returned fire , this time with deadly effect . Two regulars were killed and perhaps six wounded , with no colonial casualties . Smith sent out his flanking troops again after crossing the small bridge .",

  "One day , the protagonists seek out a dervish known as a great philosopher of the land . Pangloss asks him why Man is made to suffer so , and what they all ought to do . The dervish responds by asking rhetorically why Pangloss is concerned about the existence of evil and good .

  "The British Invasion of 1964 – 66 greatly influenced garage bands , providing them with a national audience , leading many ( often surf or hot rod groups ) to adopt a British influence , and encouraging many more groups to form . Thousands of garage bands were extant in the US and Canada during the era and hundreds produced regional hits . Examples include : \" The Witch \" by Tacoma 's the Sonics ( 1965 ) , \" Where You Gonna Go \" by Detroit 's Unrelated Segments ( 1967 ) , \" Girl I Got News for You \" by Miami 's Birdwatchers ( 1966 ) and \" 1 – 2 – 5 \" by Montreal 's the Haunted . Despite scores of bands being signed to major or large regional labels , most were commercial failures . It is generally agreed that garage rock peaked both commercially and artistically around 1966 . By 1968 the style largely disappeared from the national charts and at the local level as amateur musicians faced college , work or the draft . New styles had evolved to replace garage rock ( including blues rock , progressive rock and country rock ) . In Detroit , garage rock 's legacy remained alive into the early 1970s , with bands such as the MC5 and the Stooges , who employed a much more aggressive approach to the form . These bands began to be labelled punk rock and are now often seen as proto @-@ punk or proto @-@ hard rock .",

Khrushchev attacked Stalin both over the purges of the 1930s and the defeats of the early years of World War II , which he blamed on Stalin 's overly trusting attitude towards Hitler and the purges of the Red Army .

So @-@ called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment . Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment , one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus . The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it . Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor , specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region , the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls . That is , mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired . As expected , these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls , further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning .",

  "Gas tungsten arc welding , because it affords greater control over the weld area than other welding processes , can produce high @-@ quality welds when performed by skilled operators . Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness — all equipment and materials used must be free from oil , moisture , dirt and other impurities , as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality . To remove oil and grease , alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used , while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum . Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit . These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used , because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process , unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current . To maintain a clean weld pool during welding , the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere . GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld , increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors .",

The gameplay of the untitled Flash game has the player attempt to open a metal door by quickly clicking on it . As the door begins to open , Clover is revealed on the other side , and the player begins clicking on her breasts . Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku was perplexed by the Flash game , stating that : \" as it is pretty much the antithesis of everything presented in Virtue 's Last Reward , I truly wonder how this flash game is supposed to convince anyone to play the full title . Perhaps it 's just due to a [ public relations ] department following the old adage : ' sex sells ' . \"",

  "The Kalighat paintings and Battala woodcuts often depict the mahant as a womaniser and the temple as \" a haven for pimps \" . He was also described as \" a vile seducer \" . The Tarakeswar shrine was a famed cure for barren women . The mahant was rumoured to seduce women like Elokeshi who came to him for childbirth medicine and appropriate them with the help of his goons . After being raped , the women could not return to their family and languished in the brothels of Tarakeswar . In most plays , the mahant is described as drugging Elokeshi — by offering fake childbirth medicine — and then raping her . In the play Mohanter Dafarafa , a rare exception to the general theme of immorality in plays where the mahant misuses Elokeshi , his love is portrayed to be genuine and her seduction by him a resultant after @-@ effect . However , later he is repentant .",
  "The seasons of 1964 through 1980 in team history have often been referred to as \" the wilderness years \" for several reasons : 1 ) The franchise lost its status as an elite NFL team by posting only two winning seasons , against twelve losing and three .500 seasons during this span ; 2 ) The Giants became a \" team of nomads , \" calling four different stadiums home in the 1970s ( Yankee Stadium , the Yale Bowl , Shea Stadium , and finally Giants Stadium in 1976 ) ; 3 ) New York tried several head coach and quarterback combinations during this period , but with almost no success ( from 1964 to 1983 , no coach or starting quarterback could boast even a .500 record ) .

  "However , the Royal Geographical Society 's Secretary ( and later President ) Sir Clements Markham was a former naval man who had served on one of the Franklin relief expeditions in 1851 . He had accompanied Nares for part of the 1874 – 76 expedition , and remained a firm advocate for the navy 's resuming its historic role in polar exploration . An opportunity to further this ambition arose in November 1893 , when the prominent biologist Sir John Murray , who had visited Antarctic waters as a biologist with the Challenger Expedition in the 1870s , addressed the RGS . Murray presented a paper entitled \" The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration \" , and called for a full @-@ scale expedition for the benefit of British science .

  "As Tirpitz was still considered a major threat to Allied shipping , the British military sought to damage or destroy the battleship before she could re @-@ enter service . Another midget submarine attack was considered impractical due to improvements to Kaafjord 's defences , and the commander of the RAF 's Bomber Command refused to attempt heavy bomber raids against the battleship as he believed that such operations were unlikely to be successful and would result in heavy casualties . As a result , the Home Fleet 's aircraft carriers were considered the best means of attacking Kaafjord , and the Admiralty directed the fleet to begin planning such a raid in late 1943 . Following several months of preparations the Home Fleet 's first attack on Kaafjord , which was designated Operation Tungsten , was conducted on 3 April 1944 and involved five aircraft carriers . The two strike forces of 20 Fairey Barracuda dive bombers escorted by 40 fighters were not detected during their flights to Kaafjord , and the battleship was hit by 15 bombs . Tirpitz 's crew suffered heavy casualties , but the ship was not badly damaged . Nevertheless , the damage inflicted on Tirpitz 's superstructure , armament and engines was sufficient to put her out of service for several months while repairs were completed . The commander of Nazi Germany 's Kriegsmarine , Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz , placed a priority on returning the battleship to service so that she could continue to tie down Allied naval resources . He and other senior German officers recognised at this time that the threat of further air attacks meant that Tirpitz could no longer operate against Allied convoys .",

  "Negative resistance was first recognized during investigations of electric arcs , which were used for lighting during the 19th century . In 1881 Alfred Niaudet had observed that the voltage across arc electrodes decreased temporarily as the arc current increased , but many researchers thought this was a secondary effect due to temperature . The term \" negative resistance \" was applied by some to this effect , but the term was controversial because it was known that the resistance of a passive device could not be negative . Beginning in 1895 Hertha Ayrton , extending her husband William 's research with a series of meticulous experiments measuring the I – V curve of arcs , established that arcs had negative resistance , igniting controversy .

  "There is much debate amongst historians about Henry 's accession , in part because some see it as a cause of the Wars of the Roses .

  "The battles of zduhaći were furious . They were accompanied by forceful gales and whirlwinds which uprooted trees and whipped up dust . In Montenegro , it was considered dangerous to throw stones in the wind , because that might knock out an eye of a zduhać , who would kill the culprit . A fighting zduhać was supposed to retain his peck measure and milk bucket , while trying to seize these objects from an enemy zduhać ; he should hit and not get hit . The victorious band of zduhaći would loot the yield of all agricultural produce from the territory of their defeated foes . The harvest in the coming season would thus be excellent for the victors and poor for the defeated zduhaći .",
  "Tyrannosaurus , like most dinosaurs , was long thought to have an ectothermic ( \" cold @-@ blooded \" ) reptilian metabolism but was challenged by scientists like Robert T. Bakker and John Ostrom in the early years of the \" Dinosaur Renaissance \" , beginning in the late 1960s . Tyrannosaurus rex itself was claimed to have been endothermic ( \" warm @-@ blooded \" ) , implying a very active lifestyle . Since then , several paleontologists have sought to determine the ability of Tyrannosaurus to regulate its body temperature . Histological evidence of high growth rates in young T. rex , comparable to those of mammals and birds , may support the hypothesis of a high metabolism . Growth curves indicate that , as in mammals and birds , T. rex growth was limited mostly to immature animals , rather than the indeterminate growth seen in most other vertebrates . It has been indicated that the temperature difference may have been no more than 4 to 5 ° C ( 7 to 9 ° F ) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg . This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that T. rex maintained a constant internal body temperature ( homeothermy ) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and endothermic mammals . Later they found similar results in Giganotosaurus specimens , who lived on a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time . Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy , it does not necessarily mean that it was endothermic . Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy , as in some living sea turtles .",

  "Children under five years old display the least effective strategies for delaying gratification , such as looking at the reward and thinking about its arousing features . By 5 years old , most children are able to demonstrate better self @-@ control by recognizing the counter @-@ productivity of focusing on the reward . Five @-@ year @-@ olds often choose instead to actively distract themselves or even use self @-@ instructions to remind themselves of the contingency that waiting produces a reward of a greater value .

In 1966 , a proposal was made for Route 90 to run south to a proposed Route 38 freeway that was to run from Camden to Monmouth County . Another proposal in 1969 called for a $ 14 million ( $ 90 million today ) extension of Route 90 south to a proposed U.S. Route 30 freeway in Berlin and possibly the Atlantic City Expressway . Due to financial limitations and feared environmental impacts , the southern extension of Route 90 to Mount Laurel was canceled by 1980 .",

  "From the early 12th century onwards the Normans began to build new castles in stone and convert existing timber designs . This was initially a slow process , picking up speed towards the second half of the century . Traditionally this transition was believed to have been driven by the more crude nature of wooden fortifications , the limited life of timber in wooden castles and its vulnerability to fire ; recent archaeological studies have however shown that many wooden castles were as robust and as complex as their stone equivalents . Some wooden castles were not converted into stone for many years and instead expanded in wood , such as at Hen Domen .",

  "Undoubtedly by 1793 the armies of the French Republic were in a state of disruption ; experienced soldiers of the Ancien Régime fought side by side with raw volunteers , urged on by revolutionary fervor from the special representatives , agents of the legislature sent to insure cooperation among the military . Many of the old officer class had emigrated , and the cavalry in particular suffered from their departure . The artillery arm , considered by the old nobility to be an inferior assignment , was less affected by emigration , and survived intact . The problems would become even more acute following the introduction of mass conscription , the levée en massee , in 1793 . French commanders walked a fine line between the security of the frontier and clamor for victory ( which would protect the regime in Paris ) on the one hand , and the desperate condition of the army on the other , while they themselves were constantly under suspicion from the representatives of the new regime .

The disease , which was unusual in that it mainly affected the affluent , might have originated in France where Henry VII had recruited soldiers for his army . An epidemic hit London in the hot summer of 1508 . Victims died within a day , and there were deaths throughout the city . The streets were deserted apart from carts transporting bodies , and King Henry declared the city off limits except for physicians and apothecaries . The disease spread to Europe , arriving in Hamburg in July 1529 where one to two thousand victims died within the first few weeks . During the following months it wreaked havoc in Prussia , Switzerland , and northern Europe . The last outbreak was in England in 1556 . The disease – which killed tens of thousands of people – was probably influenza or a similar viral infection , but records from the time when medicine was not a science can be unreliable . As medicine became a science , the descriptions of disease became less vague . Although medicine could do little at the time to alleviate the suffering of the victims of infection , measures to control the spread of diseases were used . Restrictions on trade and travel were implemented , stricken families were isolated from their communities , buildings were fumigated and livestock killed .",

  "Roebling first signed on as a surveyor for the Beaver River canal system , launching his career with a string of canal and railroad projects . Aside from writing articles in engineering journals , Roebling designed his own wire cables and started his own company to manufacture them ; the John A. Roebling Company was the first wire rope manufacturer in the United States . Gradually gaining fame for his civil engineering , Roebling finally got to build suspension bridges . His first bridge was the Allegheny Suspension Aqueduct in Pittsburgh . The structure , completed in 1845 , was the first suspension aqueduct in the world and the first large American suspension bridge that had multiple spans . Furthermore , it was the first suspension structure built with modern cable spinning techniques — Roebling 's own invention . Earlier bridge building techniques involved fabricating the main cables at a factory , transporting them to the bridge site , and then stretching the heavy cables over the gap to erect them over the bridge . Roebling , during his experiments with wire ropes , conceived and patented a new construction method for these main cables . A long line — the traveler rope — formed a loop around two horizontal wheels , one on each side of the gorge . A lightweight wheel , \" the traveling wheel \" , was attached to this line , and a wire threaded around this wheel . Like a belt in a mechanical system , the traveler rope and its wheel moved across the gap as the horizontal wheels turned , pulling the wire along . The traveling wheel effectively hauled two lengths of the same wire ( running above and under the traveling wheel ) across the gap at a time . The lengths of wire were collected and bound at intervals to form thicker strands , which were later compressed together into the main cables. which supported themselves and later the proportional weight of the bridge as they were formed . The method became the standard for suspension bridge construction , and remained unchanged for many years . In the 20th century , suspension bridges were still built with this pulley winding system , albeit with more sophisticated equipment .",
  "Another candidate is Wuhan , which straddles the Yangtze at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers . It is east of both Wulin ( and Chibi City across the river ) and Jiayu . This metropolis was incorporated by joining three cities . There is a local belief in Wuhan that the battle was fought at the junction of the rivers , southwest of the former Wuchang city , which is now part of Wuhan ( de Crespigny 1990 : 256 n 78 ) . Zhang ( 2006 : 215 ; 223 ) asserts that the Chibi battlefield was one of a set of hills in Wuchang that were levelled in the 1930s so that their stone could be used as raw material .

  "At the same time the war had since the 1620s caused significant expenses for the cities , e.g. for building better defenses such as new bastions . A significant source of income for the cantons ran dry : their financial means exhausted by the war , France and Spain no longer paid the Pensions , the agreed sums in return for the cantons providing them with mercenary regiments . The city authorities tried to compensate for this and to cover their expenses on the one hand by increasing the taxes or inventing new ones and on the other hand by minting less valuable copper coins called Batzen that had the same face value as the previously minted silver money . The population began hoarding the silver coins , and the cheap copper money that remained in circulation continually lost in purchasing power . Zürich , Basel , and the central Swiss cantons therefore began already in 1623 to mint more valuable coins again . Bern and also Solothurn and Fribourg set a compulsory fixed exchange rate between copper and silver money instead , but this measure did not break the de facto devaluation . At the end of the war , the population thus faced both a postwar depression and a high inflation , combined with high taxes . This financial crisis led to a series of tax revolts in several cantons of the Confederacy , for instance 1629 – 36 in Lucerne , 1641 in Bern , or 1645 / 46 in Zürich . The uprising in 1653 continued this series , but would take the conflict to an unprecedented level .",
  "1979 Revolution : Black Friday was in development for four years ; the first two years consisted of seeking money from financiers , and the game was developed over the following two years . The game is based on events that occurred during the Iranian Revolution , namely Black Friday . The development team chose this setting shortly after the founding of development studio iNK Stories in 2010 , as they felt the chaotic environment would make players wary of which characters to trust . The team coined the term \" vérité game \" to describe 1979 Revolution , based on the cinéma vérité style of documentary filmmaking . They consider it an interactive storytelling technique that combines elements from video games and documentaries , blending them with a flexible narrative . The team wanted to avoid the game being considered strictly educational , ensuring player entertainment and engagement was the highest priority . Director Navid Khonsari said that the game 's development was the result of \" a culmination of doing games , falling in love with narrative storytelling and ... fascination with documentary \" .",

  "As a general principle of the law , criminal liability is normally only imposed upon \" a blameworthy actor who causes a prohibited harm \" , and while those who attempt crimes may be blameworthy , it can be argued that there is no harm caused ; attempted burglary , for example , does not lead to anything being stolen . Many theorists who make the distinction between successful and failed attempts do still consider the defendant partially liable , for example advocating a lesser punishment . However , there have been two distinct counterarguments advanced against making such a distinction . The first is that when a crime is attempted , there is a harm , namely a threat to security . Individuals have the right to security , both of themselves and their property , and an attempt to commit a crime infringes on this right . The second is that , regardless of the harm principle , criminal liability for attempts can be justified in utilitarian terms . A person who tries to commit a crime has shown themselves to be dangerous , and must be restrained and rehabilitated to provide a deterrence for them and for others . Although a differing approach is taken in some United States jurisdictions , intervention can happen very early in a conspiracy and the defendants can still be held liable . The earlier the liability , the more controversial .",

  "Skeptics have wondered if Marco Polo actually went to China or if he perhaps wrote his book based on hearsay . While Polo describes paper money and the burning of coal , he fails to mention the Great Wall of China , Chinese characters , chopsticks , or footbinding . In The Book of Marvels , Polo claimed that he was a close friend and advisor to Kublai Khan and that he was the governor of the city of Yangzhou for three years – yet no Chinese source mentions him as either a friend of the Emperor or as the governor of Yangzhou – indeed no Chinese source mentions Polo at all . Likewise , Polo claimed to have provided the Mongols with technical advice on building mangonels during the Siege of Xiangyang , a claim that cannot possibly be true as the siege was over before Polo had arrived in China . The Mongol army that besieged Xiangyang had several Chinese military engineers attached to it who would have known how to build catapults the equal of anything to be found in Europe . Polo 's leading latter @-@ day critic , Dr. Frances Wood in her 1995 book Did Marco Polo Go to China ? has argued that at best Polo never went further east than Persia ( modern Iran ) and that there is nothing in The Book of Marvels about China that could not be obtained via reading Persian books .

  "There is no record that any contemporary of Shakespeare referred to him as a learned writer or scholar . Ben Jonson and Francis Beaumont both refer to his lack of classical learning . If a university @-@ trained playwright wrote the plays , it is hard to explain the many classical blunders in Shakespeare . Not only does he mistake the scansion of many classical names , in Troilus and Cressida he has Greeks and Trojans citing Plato and Aristotle a thousand years before their births . Willinsky suggests that most of Shakespeare 's classical allusions were drawn from Thomas Cooper ’ s Thesaurus Linguae Romanae et Britannicae ( 1565 ) , since a number of errors in that work are replicated in several of Shakespeare ’ s plays , and a copy of this book had been bequeathed to Stratford Grammar School by John Bretchgirdle for \" the common use of scholars \" . Later critics such as Samuel Johnson remarked that Shakespeare 's genius lay not in his erudition , but in his \" vigilance of observation and accuracy of distinction which books and precepts cannot confer ; from this almost all original and native excellence proceeds . \" Even the omnivorous reading imputed to Shakespeare by critics in later years is exaggerated , and he may well have absorbed much learning from conversations . And contrary to previous claims — both scholarly and popular — about his vocabulary and word coinage , the evidence of vocabulary size and word @-@ use frequency places Shakespeare with his contemporaries , rather than apart from them . Computerized comparisons with other playwrights demonstrate that his vocabulary is indeed large , but only because the canon of his surviving plays is larger than those of his contemporaries and because of the broad range of his characters , settings , and themes .",

  "The Knickerbockers attempted to introduce the fly rule more widely at the 1857 convention , with a proposal that permitted the continued use of the bound rule for foul balls . Despite widespread support from sportswriters , the proposed rule change was voted down . Writer William Hershberger said that the decision showed \" the limits of the Knickerbockers ' influence and divisions within the baseball fraternity . \" The rule change was proposed to the NABBP annually by Adams but did not pass . At the 1858 NABBP convention , a vote on eliminating the bound rule was unsuccessful . Opponents raised concerns that the proposal would dramatically lengthen game times . Despite his support for the fly rule , in 1858 Adams successfully motioned for NABBP regulations , including outs on bounces , to apply to the Knickerbockers . He did so because he was reluctant to oppose the rules of the NABBP . Shortly after his motion , he organized a Knickerbockers meeting to discuss the fly rule and \" obtain a reconsideration \" of the newly passed resolution . At the meeting , the Knickerbockers decided to exclude outs on bounces from their practice games and contests against teams that supported the fly rule . In future years , the club remained an advocate of eliminating the bound rule , but Adams ' continued efforts were rejected . A split in the rules and regulations committee caused it to avoid supporting the fly game at the NABBP 's 1859 convention , and votes at the 1860 and 1861 conventions maintained the bound rule . Adams ' final comments about the regulation at an NABBP convention indicated that he believed it would soon be modified . The bound rule started losing support by 1863 , after Adams left the Knickerbockers , and outs on bounced balls were outlawed in 1864 .",

  "Leftover or partially eaten food ( Ucchishta ) is recommended to be offered to Matangi with the devotee in the polluted Ucchishta state , that is , having eaten but not washed , with the remains of food in the mouth and hands . Offering of leftovers to Hindu deities or being in the polluted Ucchishta state is a taboo in mainstream Hinduism . Another taboo that is broken in Matangi worship is the offering to the goddess of a cloth stained with menstrual blood to gain the ability to attract a mate . Menstrual blood is considered polluted in almost all Hindu scriptures and menstruating women are kept away from Hindu worship and temples . The outcaste Matangi community of Nepal collect polluted substances and items related to death and bad luck such as sacrificial animal heads and clothes of the deceased , and offers them at special stones kept at crossroads called chwasas , where the \" dangerous \" Matangi \" consumes \" them as an offering , thereby getting rid of the pollution . The Tantrasara also advises offerings to Matangi of meat , fish , cooked rice , milk and incense at crossroads or cremations grounds in the dead of the night to overpower enemies and gain poetic talent . Oblations of Ucchishta , cat meat and goat meat to the goddess are said to help achieve Supreme knowledge . A text proclaims Matangi 's worship becomes fruitful only if the devotee reveres women as goddesses and refrains from criticizing them .",

  "Beat poets during the 1950s wore longer hairstyles . By 1960 , a small \" beatnik \" community in Newquay , Cornwall , England ( including a young Wizz Jones ) had attracted the attention of their neighbors for growing their hair to a length past the shoulders , resulting in a television interview with Alan Whicker on BBC television 's Tonight series . The 1960s also introduced The Beatles , who started a more widespread longer hair trend . The social revolution of the 1960s led to a renaissance of unchecked hair growth , and long hair , especially on men , was worn as a political or countercultural symbol or protest and as a symbol of masculinity . This cultural symbol extended to several Western countries in the Americas , Western Europe , South Africa , and Australia . Specific long hairstyles such as dreadlocks have been part of counterculture movements seeking to define other alternative cultures and lifestyles since this time . Longer hair in general remained popular due to the youth rebellion throughout the liberal decade of the 1960s . The long hair trend grew with the spread of the hippie movement in the 1960s and , in the 1970s , longer hair styles would become the norm among men and women .",
  "The capacity of the Parliament to solve major socioeconomic problems was stymied by confrontations between the representatives of the largely uneducated common man and the representatives of the former estates , accustomed to autocratic rule and attitudes . At the same time , conflict grew between industrial employers and their workers as the industrialists denied collective bargaining and the right of the labour unions to represent working people ; the employers essentially dictated contracts signed on the personal level . Although the parliamentary process disappointed the labour movement , dominance in the Finnish Parliament and in legislation was the workers ' pathway to reach a more balanced society - they identified themselves powerfully to the state .

  "The archetypal example of this situation is antithrombin , which circulates in plasma in a partially inserted relatively inactive state . The primary specificity determining residue ( the P1 arginine ) points toward the body of the serpin and is unavailable to the protease . Upon binding a high @-@ affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long @-@ chain heparin , antithrombin undergoes a conformational change , RCL expulsion , and exposure of the P1 arginine . The heparin pentasaccharide @-@ bound form of antithrombin is , thus , a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa . Furthermore , both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites ( called exosites ) for heparin . Heparin , therefore , also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin , further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties . After the initial interaction , the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released . This interaction is physiologically important . For example , after injury to the blood vessel wall , heparin is exposed , and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response . Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux , a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti @-@ clotting drug .",

  "Stelae were usually crafted from quarried limestone , although in the Southern Maya area other types of stone were preferred .

  "There is little record of Cynicism in the 2nd or 1st centuries BC ; Cicero ( c . 50 BC ) , who was much interested in Greek philosophy , had little to say about Cynicism , except that \" it is to be shunned ; for it is opposed to modesty , without which there can be neither right nor honor . \" However , by the 1st century AD , Cynicism reappeared with full force . The rise of Imperial Rome , like the Greek loss of independence under Philip and Alexander three centuries earlier , may have led to a sense of powerlessness and frustration among many people , which allowed a philosophy which emphasized self @-@ sufficiency and inner @-@ happiness to flourish once again . Cynics could be found throughout the empire , standing on street corners , preaching about virtue . Lucian complained that \" every city is filled with such upstarts , particularly with those who enter the names of Diogenes , Antisthenes , and Crates as their patrons and enlist in the Army of the Dog , \" and Aelius Aristides observed that \" they frequent the doorways , talking more to the doorkeepers than to the masters , making up for their lowly condition by using impudence . \" The most notable representative of Cynicism in the 1st century AD was Demetrius , whom Seneca praised as \" a man of consummate wisdom , though he himself denied it , constant to the principles which he professed , of an eloquence worthy to deal with the mightiest subjects . \" Cynicism in Rome was both the butt of the satirist and the ideal of the thinker . In the 2nd century AD , Lucian , whilst pouring scorn on the Cynic philosopher Peregrinus Proteus , nevertheless praised his own Cynic teacher , Demonax , in a dialogue .",

Still suffering from hunger and pestilence , the Arabs lost a major battle against the Bulgars , who killed , according to Theophanes , 22 @,@ 000 . It is unclear , however , whether the Bulgars attacked the Arab encampment because of their treaty with Leo or whether the Arabs strayed into Bulgar territory seeking provisions , as reported by the Syriac Chronicle of 846 . Michael the Syrian mentions that the Bulgars participated in the siege from the beginning , with attacks against the Arabs as they marched through Thrace and subsequently on their encampment , but this is not corroborated elsewhere . The siege had clearly failed , and Caliph Umar sent orders to Maslama to retreat . After thirteen months of siege , on 15 August 718 , the Arabs departed . The date coincided with the feast of the Dormition of the Theotokos ( Assumption of Mary ) , and it was to her that the Byzantines ascribed their victory . The retreating Arabs were not hindered or attacked on their return , but their fleet lost more ships in a storm in the Marmara Sea while other ships were set afire by ashes from the volcano of Santorini , and some of the survivors were captured by the Byzantines , so that Theophanes claims that only five vessels made it back to Syria .

  "DNA repair is a collection of processes by which a cell identifies and corrects damage to the DNA molecules that encode its genome . In human cells , both normal metabolic activities and environmental factors such as radiation can cause DNA damage , resulting in as many as 1 million individual molecular lesions per cell per day . Many of these lesions cause structural damage to the DNA molecule and can alter or eliminate the cell 's ability to transcribe the gene that the affected DNA encodes . Other lesions induce potentially harmful mutations in the cell 's genome , which affect the survival of its daughter cells after it undergoes mitosis . As a consequence , the DNA repair process is constantly active as it responds to damage in the DNA structure . When normal repair processes fail , and when cellular apoptosis does not occur , irreparable DNA damage may occur , including double @-@ strand breaks and DNA crosslinkages ( interstrand crosslinks or ICLs ) . This can eventually lead to malignant tumors , or cancer as per the two hit hypothesis .",

Most of the life history information available on this species has come from Bahía Magdalena , where females bear one litter of 1 – 4 pups per year . Courtship and mating occurs in late summer from July to August , but due to a ten @-@ month period of either sperm storage or diapause ( wherein the embryo becomes dormant ) , embryonic development does not begin until the following year and is completed within 2 – 3 months .

He told of how animals such as muskrat , beaver and bear were capable of intentionally bandaging their wounds and stumps of amputated limbs by coating them with materials such as tree resin or clay to keep the injury clean . The example that received the greatest attention was the story about a \" woodcock genius \" who set his own broken leg and applied a cast to the injury :",

  "Inevitably linked with Roosevelt , Taft generally falls in the shadow of the flamboyant Rough Rider , who chose him to be president , and who took it away . Yet , a portrait of Taft as a victim of betrayal by his best friend is incomplete : as Coletta put it , \" Was he a poor politician because he was victimized or because he lacked the foresight and imagination to notice the storm brewing in the political sky until it broke and swamped him ? \" Adept at using the levers of power in a way his successor could not , Roosevelt generally got what was politically possible out of a situation . Taft was generally slow to act , and when he did , his actions often generated enemies , as in the Ballinger @-@ Pinchot affair . Roosevelt was able to secure positive coverage in the newspapers ; Taft had a judge 's reticence in talking to reporters , and , with no comment from the White House , hostile journalists would supply the want with a quote from a Taft opponent . And it was Roosevelt who engraved in public memory the image of Taft as a Buchanan @-@ like figure , with a narrow view of the presidency which made him unwilling to act for the public good . Anderson pointed out that Roosevelt 's Autobiography ( which placed this view in enduring form ) was published after both men had left the presidency ( in 1913 ) , was intended in part to justify Roosevelt 's splitting of the Republican Party , and contains not a single positive reference to the man Roosevelt had admired and hand @-@ picked as his successor . While Roosevelt was biased , he was not alone : every major newspaper reporter of that time who left reminiscences of Taft 's presidency was critical of him .

  "In philosophy , Chinese Buddhism had waned in influence but it retained its hold on the arts and on the charities of monasteries . Buddhism had a profound influence upon the budding movement of Neo @-@ Confucianism , led by Cheng Yi ( 1033 – 1107 ) and Zhu Xi ( 1130 – 1200 ) . Mahayana Buddhism influenced Fan Zhongyan and Wang Anshi through its concept of ethical universalism , while Buddhist metaphysics deeply affected the pre – Neo @-@ Confucian doctrine of Cheng Yi . The philosophical work of Cheng Yi in turn influenced Zhu Xi . Although his writings were not accepted by his contemporary peers , Zhu 's commentary and emphasis upon the Confucian classics of the Four Books as an introductory corpus to Confucian learning formed the basis of the Neo @-@ Confucian doctrine . By the year 1241 , under the sponsorship of Emperor Lizong , Zhu Xi 's Four Books and his commentary on them became standard requirements of study for students attempting to pass the civil service examinations . The East Asian countries of Japan and Korea also adopted Zhu Xi 's teaching , known as the Shushigaku ( 朱子學 , School of Zhu Xi ) of Japan , and in Korea the Jujahak ( 주자학 ) . Buddhism 's continuing influence can be seen in painted artwork such as Lin Tinggui 's Luohan Laundering . However , the ideology was highly criticized and even scorned by some . The statesman and historian Ouyang Xiu ( 1007 – 1072 ) called the religion a \" curse \" that could only be remedied by uprooting it from Chinese culture and replacing it with Confucian discourse . A true revival of Buddhism in Chinese society would not occur until the Mongol rule of the Yuan dynasty , with Kublai Khan 's sponsorship of Tibetan Buddhism and Drogön Chögyal Phagpa as the leading lama . The Christian sect of Nestorianism , which had entered China in the Tang era , would also be revived in China under Mongol rule .",

  "Since postseason games cannot end in a tie unlike the preseason or regular season , additional overtime periods are played as necessary until a winner is determined . Furthermore , all clock rules apply as if a game had started over . Therefore , if the first overtime period ends with the score still tied , the teams switch ends of the field prior to double overtime . If a game was still tied with two minutes to go in double overtime , there would be a two @-@ minute warning ( but not during the first overtime period as in the regular season ) .

  "The breed exhibits a natural ambling gait , called the single @-@ foot , which replaces the trot seen in a majority of horse breeds . Both gaits are an intermediate speed between a walk and a canter or gallop ; ambling gaits are four @-@ beat gaits , whereas the trot is a two @-@ beat gait . The extra footfalls provide additional smoothness to a rider because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground . This minimizes movement of the horse 's topline and removes the bounce of a two @-@ beat gait , caused by a moment of suspension followed by the jolt of two feet hitting the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other . The value of an intermediate speed is that the horse conserves energy . More than thirty horse breeds are \" gaited , \" able to perform a four @-@ beat ambling gait , and some can also trot . Thus , a Rocky Mountain Horse , with rider , can use the single @-@ foot to cover rough ground at around 7 miles per hour ( 11 km / h ) and short stretches of smooth ground at up to 16 miles per hour ( 26 km / h ) .

  "MacLaren 's obituary in The Times stated that he was \" one of the outstanding opening batsmen of all time \" . As a batsman , he had a reputation for stylishness , but his technique was based on scoring runs safely . He always tried to seize the initiative in a game . Batting with his head slightly raised , he drew his bat back unusually far , which provided the power to his shots , and in particular his drives . He scored runs quickly , mainly through his ability to score from good length balls . When playing a shot , he either stepped right forward or moved far back in the batting crease and having hit the ball , he followed through with the bat , often holding his pose for effect . These qualities , and his quick footwork , made him effective on difficult batting pitches . One of his most highly regarded shots was the hook . In later years , Cardus described the shot : \" To see MacLaren hook a fast ball ... from the front of his face , was in those days an experience which thrilled me like heroic poetry ; he didn 't merely hook the ball , he dismissed it from his presence . \" Cardus , for whom MacLaren was a boyhood hero , wrote prolifically about him in later years ; he called one such essay on MacLaren \" The Noblest Roman \" , and judged him among the best of all batsmen . Gideon Haigh suggests : \" If ever a cricketer was the creation of a single writer , it is MacLaren , the luminous majesty with which he is associated owed in very large degree to his youthful acolyte Neville Cardus . \" MacLaren was also a highly proficient fielder , initially in the outfield but later at slip .",

For example , some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor , others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mGluR ) , while still others depend upon another molecule altogether . The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is observed . For example , LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor @-@ dependent , whereas LTP in the mossy fiber pathway is NMDA receptor @-@ independent .",

  "A play of The Disenchanted opened on Broadway in 1958 . Also that year , Scott 's Hollywood mistress Sheilah Graham published a memoir , Beloved Infidel , about his last years . Beloved Infidel became a bestseller and later a film starring Gregory Peck as Scott and Deborah Kerr as Graham . The book and movie painted him in a more sympathetic light than the earlier works . In 1970 , however , Scott and Zelda 's marriage saw its most profound revision , when Nancy Milford , a graduate student at Columbia University , published Zelda : A Biography , the first book @-@ length treatment of Zelda 's life .

  "In 1735 Handel received the text for a new oratorio named Saul from its librettist Charles Jennens , a wealthy landowner with musical and literary interests . Because Handel 's main creative concern was still with opera , he did not write the music for Saul until 1738 , in preparation for his 1738 – 39 theatrical season . The work , after opening at the King 's Theatre in January 1739 to a warm reception , was quickly followed by the less successful oratorio Israel in Egypt ( which may also have come from Jennens ) . Although Handel continued to write operas , the trend towards English @-@ language productions became irresistible as the decade ended . After three performances of his last Italian opera Deidamia in January and February 1741 , he abandoned the genre . In July 1741 Jennens sent him a new libretto for an oratorio ; in a letter dated 10 July to his friend Edward Holdsworth , Jennens wrote : \" I hope [ Handel ] will lay out his whole Genius & Skill upon it , that the Composition may excell all his former Compositions , as the Subject excells every other subject . The Subject is Messiah \" .",

  "The ideal that respectable women should remain out of the public eye was so entrenched in classical Athens that simply naming a citizen woman could be a source of shame . Priestesses were the only group of women to be exempt from this rule . Thucydides wrote in his History of the Peloponnesian War , \" Great honour is hers whose reputation among males is least , whether for praise or blame \" . Women were identified in terms of their male relatives , which could create confusion if two sisters were referred to as the son ( or brother ) of the same man .

  "Niobium is used as a precious metal in commemorative coins , often with silver or gold . For example , Austria produced a series of silver niobium euro coins starting in 2003 ; the colour in these coins is created by the diffraction of light by a thin anodized oxide layer . In 2012 , ten coins are available showing a broad variety of colours in the centre of the coin : blue , green , brown , purple , violet , or yellow . Two more examples are the 2004 Austrian € 25 150 Years Semmering Alpine Railway commemorative coin , and the 2006 Austrian € 25 European Satellite Navigation commemorative coin . The Austrian mint produced for Latvia a similar series of coins starting in 2004 , with one following in 2007 . In 2011 , the Royal Canadian Mint started production of a $ 5 sterling silver and niobium coin named Hunter 's Moon in which the niobium was selectively oxidized , thus creating unique finishes where no two coins are exactly alike .",

  "The case for excluding Oswiu from any role in Wighard 's election is based on the theory that Bede misinterpreted a letter from Vitalian to Oswiu as stating that Oswiu was involved in the selection . The historian Nicholas Brooks points out that although Bede may have indeed misread Vitalian 's letter , Oswiu had other reasons for involving himself in Deusdedit 's replacement , not least of which was a concern that the exiled Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid , who was in Kent and Mercia at the time , not be selected as the new archbishop .

Brooks points out that one reason Wighard might have journeyed to Rome was to receive his pallium .

As Mary Favret writes , \" the disembodied Percy identifies the spirit of poetry itself \" . Mary glossed Percy 's political radicalism as a form of sentimentalism , arguing that his republicanism arose from sympathy for those who were suffering . She inserted romantic anecdotes of his benevolence , domesticity , and love of the natural world . Portraying herself as Percy 's \" practical muse \" , she also noted how she had suggested revisions as he wrote .",

The day of this announcement , after it became clear that Cindy Pritzker would fund the project , Gehry agreed to the design request .

  "The end of the Middle Ages brought with it a waning of interest in King Arthur . Although Malory 's English version of the great French romances was popular , there were increasing attacks upon the truthfulness of the historical framework of the Arthurian romances – established since Geoffrey of Monmouth 's time – and thus the legitimacy of the whole Matter of Britain . So , for example , the 16th @-@ century humanist scholar Polydore Vergil famously rejected the claim that Arthur was the ruler of a post @-@ Roman empire , found throughout the post @-@ Galfridian medieval ' chronicle tradition ' , to the horror of Welsh and English antiquarians . Social changes associated with the end of the medieval period and the Renaissance also conspired to rob the character of Arthur and his associated legend of some of their power to enthrall audiences , with the result that 1634 saw the last printing of Malory 's Le Morte d 'Arthur for nearly 200 years . King Arthur and the Arthurian legend were not entirely abandoned , but until the early 19th century the material was taken less seriously and was often used simply as a vehicle for allegories of 17th- and 18th @-@ century politics . Thus Richard Blackmore 's epics Prince Arthur ( 1695 ) and King Arthur ( 1697 ) feature Arthur as an allegory for the struggles of William III against James II . Similarly , the most popular Arthurian tale throughout this period seems to have been that of Tom Thumb , which was told first through chapbooks and later through the political plays of Henry Fielding ; although the action is clearly set in Arthurian Britain , the treatment is humorous and Arthur appears as a primarily comedic version of his romance character .",

They were able to replicate the proposed motion with their model , although they found that additional secondary movements between other bones were required , with maximum separations of 1 @.@ 3 to 1 @.@ 4 centimetres ( 0 @.@ 51 to 0 @.@ 55 in ) between some bones during the chewing cycle . Rybczynski and colleagues were not convinced that the Weishampel model is viable , but noted that they have several improvements to implement to their animation . Planned improvements include incorporating soft tissue and tooth wear marks and scratches , which should better constrain movements . They note that there are several other hypotheses to test as well . Further research published in 2012 by Robin Cuthbertson and colleagues found the motions required for Weishampel 's model to be unlikely , and favored a model in which movements of the lower jaw produced grinding action . The lower jaw 's joint with the upper jaw would permit anterior – posterior motion along with the usual rotation , and the anterior joint of the two halves of the lower jaw would also permit motion ; in combination , the two halves of the lower jaw could move slightly back and forth as well as rotating slightly along their long axes . These motions would account for the observed tooth wear and a more solidly constructed skull than modeled by Weishampel .",

  "Subwoofer output level can be increased by increasing cone surface area or by increasing cone excursion .

  "A general decline in living amphibian species has been linked with the fungal disease chytridiomycosis . A higher proportion of salamander species than of frogs or caecilians are in one of the at @-@ risk categories established by the IUCN . Salamanders showed a significant diminution in numbers in the last few decades of the 20th century , although no direct link between the fungus and the population decline has yet been found . The IUCN made further efforts in 2005 as they established the Amphibian Conservation Action Plan ( ACAP ) , which was subsequently followed by Amphibian Ark ( AArk ) , Amphibian Specialist Group ( ASG ) , and finally the umbrella organization known as the Amphibian Survival Alliance ( ASA ) . Researchers also cite deforestation , resulting in fragmentation of suitable habitats , and climate change as possible contributory factors . Species such as Pseudoeurycea brunnata and Pseudoeurycea goebeli that had been abundant in the cloud forests of Guatemala and Mexico during the 1970s were found by 2009 to be rare . However , few data have been gathered on population sizes over the years , and by intensive surveying of historic and suitable new locations , it has been possible to locate individuals of other species such as Parvimolge townsendi , which had been thought to be extinct . Currently , the major lines of defense for the conservation of Salamanders includes both in situ and ex situ conservation methods.There are efforts in place for certain members of the Salamander family to be conserved under a conservation breeding program ( CBP ) but it is important to note that there should be research done ahead of time to determine if the Salamander species is actually going to value from the CBP , as researchers have noted that some species of amphibians completely fail in this environment .",

This progress in his personal life , however , could not be matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles , Catherine 's nephew , to support the annulment of his aunt 's marriage .",

  "In the 1830s George Baxter repopularised colour relief printing , known as chromoxylography , by using a \" background detail plate printed in aquatint intaglio , followed by colours printed in oil inks from relief plates — usually wood blocks \" .

For The Poems of Oliver Goldsmith , Evans created a facsimile of a watercolour , by superimposing colours with the use of separate colour blocks , one by one , to achieve the graduated colours of the original . First , Foster drew the illustration directly on the woodblocks that were to be cut , and he then recreated a coloured paper copy of the drawing . Evans , using the same pigments as Foster , grinding them himself , produced inks to match Foster 's colours .

The Enquiry is 9 books of \" applied \" botany dealing with the forms and classification of plants and economic botany , examining the techniques of agriculture ( relationship of crops to soil , climate , water and habitat ) and horticulture . He described some 500 plants in detail , often including descriptions of habitat and geographic distribution , and he recognised some plant groups that can be recognised as modern @-@ day plant families .

  "The Phedina species are members of the swallow family of birds , and are classed as members of the Hirundininae subfamily , which comprises all swallows and martins except the very distinctive river martins . DNA sequence studies suggest that there are three major groupings within the Hirundininae , broadly correlating with the type of nest built . These groups are the \" core martins \" , including burrowing species like the sand martin ; the \" nest @-@ adopters \" , which are birds like the tree swallow that utilise natural cavities ; and the \" mud nest builders \" , such as the barn swallow , which build a nest from mud . The Phedina species nest in burrows and therefore belong to the \" core martins \" group .",

  "Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road , the Uptown District boomed during the 1970s and early 1980s when a collection of midrise office buildings , hotels , and retail developments appeared along Interstate 610 West .

  "The first land grant at Carrick was in 1818 and a decade later William Bryan was building a wooden mill on the river 's bank . The town was formed in consequence of this mill 's construction and town plots sold in 1838 . Carrick Post Office opened on 5 November 1841 . Carrick never grew large — the population varied from around 200 to 439 — and today it is largely a residential settlement for those who work in Launceston and the rural areas surrounding the town . During much of its history growth has been limited by lack of organised water supply and sewerage , though reticulated services for both are now connected . Volunteer labour enabled piped water supply , from the Liffey , from 1961 and a sewerage plant was built in the mid @-@ 1970s on the towns outskirts .

  "The eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into free @-@ living larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults . In many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders ( Plethodontidae ) , direct development takes place , the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults . Many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land , and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies . Some caecilians , the alpine salamander ( Salamandra atra ) and some of the African live @-@ bearing toads ( Nectophrynoides spp . ) are viviparous . Their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the female 's oviduct , often for long periods . Other amphibians , but not caecilians , are ovoviviparous .

The larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth , either before or after metamorphosis , according to their species . The toad genus Nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members .",

  "Many of the attackers seem to have wanted to force the Jews to convert , although they were also interested in acquiring money from them . Physical violence against Jews was never part of the church hierarchy 's official policy for crusading , and the Christian bishops , especially the Archbishop of Cologne , did their best to protect the Jews . A decade before , the Bishop of Speyer had taken the step of providing the Jews of that city with a walled ghetto to protect them from Christian violence and given their chief Rabbis the control of judicial matters in the quarter . Nevertheless , some also took money in return for their protection . The attacks may have originated in the belief that Jews and Muslims were equally enemies of Christ , and enemies were to be fought or converted to Christianity . Godfrey of Bouillon was rumoured to have extorted money from the Jews of Cologne and Mainz , and many of the Crusaders wondered why they should travel thousands of miles to fight non @-@ believers when there were already non @-@ believers closer to home .
