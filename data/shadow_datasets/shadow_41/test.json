This struggle , according to Walter Evert , has \" no relevance to the world of external action and perhaps no truth to offer even the visionary dreamer himself . \" However Anthony Hecht looks at the problem in a different way and believes that there must be a connection between the external and internal worlds for the narrator to even face the problem .

  "The work of the CNSA during the war was considered extremely successful by contemporaries and modern historians alike . By providing a network of food distribution , the CNSA and CRB managed to avoid a major famine in Belgium during the occupation . Nevertheless , although the CRB and CNSA were part of the same network , the CRB criticized the CNSA , holding it responsible for occasional thefts of food by the Germans and for providing inadequate security for the shipments . The Belgian arm , however , felt under undue pressure from the CRB .

Nevertheless , relations between the two bodies remained generally good .",
  "The speed of sound in helium is nearly three times the speed of sound in air . Because the fundamental frequency of a gas @-@ filled cavity is proportional to the speed of sound in the gas , when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract . The fundamental frequency ( sometimes called pitch ) does not change , since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds , which is unchanged .

The opposite effect , lowering resonant frequencies , can be obtained by inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon .",

  "The European coronation ceremonies of the Middle Ages were essentially a combination of the Christian rite of anointing with additional elements . Following Europe 's conversion to Christianity , crowning ceremonies became more and more ornate , depending on the country in question , and their Christian elements — especially anointing — became the paramount concern . Crowns and sceptres , used in coronations since ancient times , took on a Christian significance together with the orb as symbols of the purported divine order of things , with the monarch as the divinely ordained overlord and protector of his dominion . During the Middle Ages , this rite was considered so vital in some European kingdoms that it was sometimes referred to as an \" eighth sacrament \" . The anointed ruler was viewed as a mixta persona , part priest and part layman , but never wholly either . This notion persisted into the twentieth century in Imperial Russia , where the Tsar was considered to be \" wedded \" to his subjects through the Orthodox coronation service .

  "Since its creation , the program has received much criticism both within and outside Puerto Rico . Critics argue that , since the program provides non @-@ taxable income without any employment requirements , recipients receive free money without incentives for work , which hinders the economic output and development of the island , especially when Puerto Rico 's employment participation and unemployment rates have been consistently inferior to U.S. national levels , while the average aid provided in Puerto Rico has exceeded the U.S. national average ( $ 94 versus $ 74 @.@ 79 , respectively ; 2001 estimate ) . Because of this , Puerto Rico has been called the \" welfare island \" . People from the Dominican Republic do many of the jobs in Puerto Rico that pay too little to attract the locals . However , proponents of the program argue that Puerto Rico 's social condition is in far worse shape than any of the 50 U.S. states . Approximately half of the island 's population lives below the U.S. Federal poverty guidelines , and many have difficulties in meeting their nutritional needs due to increasing inflation and economic stagnation in the island . Furthermore , the relation between the NAP program 's benefits and the low employment participation and high unemployment rates has not been studied , and there is no consensus on their actual causes .",

  "Each attempt to answer the mind – body problem encounters substantial problems . Some philosophers argue that this is because there is an underlying conceptual confusion . These philosophers , such as Ludwig Wittgenstein and his followers in the tradition of linguistic criticism , therefore reject the problem as illusory . They argue that it is an error to ask how mental and biological states fit together . Rather it should simply be accepted that human experience can be described in different ways — for instance , in a mental and in a biological vocabulary . Illusory problems arise if one tries to describe the one in terms of the other 's vocabulary or if the mental vocabulary is used in the wrong contexts . This is the case , for instance , if one searches for mental states of the brain . The brain is simply the wrong context for the use of mental vocabulary — the search for mental states of the brain is therefore a category error or a sort of fallacy of reasoning .",

  "In 1616 , following Grey 's death , Hues began to be \" attendant upon th 'aforesaid Earle of Northumberland for matters of learning \" , and was paid a yearly sum of £ 40 to support his research until Northumberland 's death in 1632 . Wood stated that Harriot , Hues and Warner were Northumberland 's \" constant companions , and were usually called the Earl of Northumberland 's Three Magi . They had a table at the Earl 's charge , and the Earl himself did constantly converse with them , and with Sir Walter Raleigh , then in the Tower \" . Together with the scientist Nathanael Toporley and the mathematician Thomas Allen , the men kept abreast of developments in astronomy , mathematics , physiology and the physical sciences , and made important contributions in these areas . According to the letter writer John Chamberlain , Northumberland refused a pardon offered to him in 1617 , preferring to remain with Harriot , Hues and Warner . However , the fact that these companions of Northumberland were his \" Three Magi \" studying with him in the Tower of London has been regarded as a romanticisation by the antiquarian John Aubrey and disputed for lack of evidence . Hues was tutor to Northumberland 's sons : first Algernon Percy , who subsequently became the 10th Earl of Northumberland , at Oxford where he matriculated at Christ Church in 1617 ; and later Algernon 's younger brother Henry in 1622 – 1623 .

  "Holocaust deniers claim that Zyklon B gas was not used in the gas chambers , relying for evidence on the research of Fred A.

Leuchter 's negative control , a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building , had no cyanide residue . In 1999 , James Roth , the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter 's samples , stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks , and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface . The surface that had been exposed to the chemical was not identified , and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount .

  "For much of the Middle Ages , England 's climate differed from that in the 21st century . Between the 9th and 13th centuries England went through the Medieval Warm Period , a prolonged period of warmer temperatures ; in the early 13th century , for example , summers were around 1 ° C warmer than today and the climate was slightly drier . These warmer temperatures allowed poorer land to be brought into cultivation and for grapevines to be cultivated relatively far north .

  "As Australia won the series convincingly 4 – 0 , it is not surprising that their players dominated the statistical rankings . Australian batsmen scored eight centuries to four by their English counterparts and scored their runs at a much higher average . Six of the nine highest averaging batsmen were Australian . On the bowling front , Australia 's pace attack had far more success and they were a large part of the success . Lindwall and Johnston both took 27 wickets , supported by Miller and Toshack , who took 13 and 11 respectively . For England , only Bedser with 18 was able to take 10 or more wickets , and at a substantially higher cost than the Australian pacemen . The bowling was dominated by pace bowling , with Laker being the only spinner on the list , with by far the worst average .

As a new ball is more conducive to fast bowling , this favoured fast bowlers and therefore the team with the best pace attack , in this case Australia .",

The vocal requirements for all of the major roles were greatly reduced for Peking opera .

The melodies that accompany each play were also simplified , and are played with different traditional instruments than in earlier forms . Perhaps most noticeably , true acrobatic elements were introduced with Peking opera . The form grew in popularity throughout the 19th century .

Beginning in 1884 , the Empress Dowager Cixi became a regular patron of Peking opera , cementing its status over earlier forms like Kunqu .

  "The structure of a nucleic acid molecule consists of a sequence of nucleotides distinguished by which nucleobase they contain . In DNA , the four bases present are adenine ( A ) , cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) , and thymine ( T ) . Nucleic acids have the property that two molecules will only bind to each other to form a double helix if the two sequences are complementary , meaning that they form matching sequences of base pairs , with A only binding to T , and C only to G. Because the formation of correctly matched base pairs is energetically favorable , nucleic acid strands are expected in most cases to bind to each other in the conformation that maximizes the number of correctly paired bases . The sequences of bases in a system of strands thus determine the pattern of binding and the overall structure in an easily controllable way . In DNA nanotechnology , the base sequences of strands are rationally designed by researchers so that the base pairing interactions cause the strands to assemble in the desired conformation . While DNA is the dominant material used , structures incorporating other nucleic acids such as RNA and peptide nucleic acid ( PNA ) have also been constructed .",

Lefroy had just completed his university education and was moving to London for training as a barrister . Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering , and it is clear from her letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together : \" I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved .

  "Cascades of strand displacement reactions can be used for either computational or structural purposes . An individual strand displacement reaction involves revealing a new sequence in response to the presence of some initiator strand . Many such reactions can be linked into a cascade where the newly revealed output sequence of one reaction can initiate another strand displacement reaction elsewhere . This in turn allows for the construction of chemical reaction networks with many components , exhibiting complex computational and information processing abilities . These cascades are made energetically favorable through the formation of new base pairs , and the entropy gain from disassembly reactions . Strand displacement cascades allow for isothermal operation of the assembly or computational process , as opposed to traditional nucleic acid assembly 's requirement for a thermal annealing step , where the temperature is raised and then slowly lowered to ensure proper formation of the desired structure . They can also support catalytic functionality of the initiator species , where less than one equivalent of the initiator can cause the reaction to go to completion .",

Rather than attaching any countercultural significance to this , however , Gould views it as the Beatles repeating the wordplay first used in the chorus of Lennon 's 1963 song \" It Won 't Be Long \" .",

  "Plans to re @-@ route the outfall along a new channel which would meet the River Witham at The Scalp , near Boston , were authorised in 1794 , but the money could not be raised at the time , due to the financial crisis caused by the French Wars . Grundy 's shorter channel had been finished by 1810 , improving both drainage and navigation .

  "Although the settlement of Warkworth in Northumberland dates back to at least the 8th century , the first castle was not built until after the Norman Conquest . The town and its castle occupied a loop of the River Coquet . The castle was built at the south end of the town , guarding the narrow neck of the loop . A fortified bridge also defended the approach to the town . The surrounding lowland countryside was favourable for agriculture . When the castle was founded and by whom is uncertain , though traditionally Prince Henry of Scotland has been thought responsible . With civil war in south @-@ west England , King Stephen of England needed to ensure northern England was secure . To this end , the Treaty of Durham in 1139 between Scotland and England ensured peace . Under the treaty Henry of Scotland became Earl of Northumbria in exchange for ceding control of the castles at Bamburgh and Newcastle to the English . Without them Henry would have needed a new seat from which to exercise his authority , and a new castle at Warkworth may have met the requirement . However , charters show that Henry still controlled Bamburgh Castle after the treaty , and as Warkworth was a modest castle by contemporary standards it may be have been founded by someone else . Henry died in 1152 and his son , Malcolm ( crowned King of Scotland in 1153 ) , inherited his lands . In 1157 Malcolm travelled to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire , where he paid homage to the new King of England , Henry II . Malcolm surrendered England 's northern counties to Henry , including the castles of Bamburgh , Carlisle , and Newcastle , and probably Appleby , Brough , Wark , and Warkworth , though it is possible that Henry II founded Warkworth Castle in 1157 to secure his lands in Northumberland ; other contemporary castles in the area were built for this purpose , for instance the one at Harbottle .",

  "In 1992 , Ocean Software ported the game to home gaming systems , including the Amiga , Atari ST , Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum . Due to the hardware limitations of the various systems , the graphics and sounds of the ports differ from the original arcade version ; for example , the ZX Spectrum version did not allow the aliens ' limbs to be shot off . Some home versions use a light gun peripheral to simulate the control scheme of the arcade format . Taito 's Sega Master System port uses the Sega Light Phaser accessory . The Amiga and Atari ST versions are one of the few games to use the Trojan Light Gun . In developing the Amiga conversion , the team video taped the arcade machine in operation as a reference for the graphics , pausing the video at relevant spots to take notes before recreating them .

  "The occasion for the invasion of Sicily was provided by the rebellion of the tourmarches Euphemius , commander of the island 's fleet . According to later and possibly fictional accounts , driven by lust for a nun , he had forced her to marry him . Her brothers protested to Emperor Michael II , and the Byzantine ruler ordered the island 's strategos , Constantine Soudas , to investigate the matter and if the charges were found true , to cut off Euphemius ' nose as punishment . Thus it came that Euphemius , returning from a naval raid against the African coast , learned that he was to be arrested . Instead , he sailed for Syracuse , occupying the city , while the governor sought refuge in Catana . Euphemius soon managed to gain the support of a large part of the island 's military leadership . Euphemius not only repulsed an attempt by Constantine to recover Syracuse , but pursued him and drove him out of Catana , and eventually captured and executed him . Euphemius was then proclaimed emperor . The historian Alexander Vasiliev doubts the \" romantic \" story of the origin of Euphemius ' revolt , and believes that the ambitious general simply used an opportune moment , when the central Byzantine government was weakened by the recent Revolt of Thomas the Slav , and by its preoccupation with the contemporary Muslim conquest of Crete , to seize power for himself .",

William established a defensive ring of motte and bailey castles around London ; each was a day 's march – about 20 miles ( 32 km ) – from the city and from the next castle , allowing for easy reinforcements in a crisis . Windsor Castle , one of this ring of fortifications , was strategically important because of its proximity to both the River Thames , a key medieval route into London , and Windsor Forest , a royal hunting preserve previously used by the Saxon kings .

As a result , Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities . This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that \" Spelling Bee is for someone else \" . She \" must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy , \" and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man , it \" empowers her to ... accomplish this task . \" Fishburne stated the film 's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success , and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society .

Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics \" but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful . \"",

  "In animals , amino acids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing protein . Ingested proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion , which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases . Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis , while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis , or fed into the citric acid cycle . This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body 's own proteins to be used to support life , particularly those found in muscle . Amino acids are also an important dietary source of nitrogen .",

  "Ultrasonography is based on the principle that sound can pass through human body tissues and is reflected by the tissue interfaces in the same way that light can reflect back on itself , from a mirror . Tissue in the body will offer varying degrees of resistance , known as acoustic impedance , to the path of the ultrasound beam . When there is a high impedance difference between two tissues , the interface between them will strongly reflect the sound . When the ultrasound beam meets air , or solid tissue such as bone , their impedance difference is so great that most of the acoustic energy is reflected making it impossible to see any underlying structures . The examiner will see just a shadow , instead of the image expected . Air will impede sound waves which is why a gel is used . The gel prevents air bubbles from forming between the probe , and the patient 's skin and so helps the conduction of the sound waves from the transducer into the body . The watery medium also helps to conduct the sound waves . Liquids , including blood have a low impedance , which means that little energy will be reflected and no visualization possible . One of the important exceptions is that when the blood flow is very slow it can in fact be seen , in what is termed \" spontaneous contrast \" .",

  "Morton was never able to make significant electoral inroads on Lincoln 's majorities in the years the latter held the governor 's seat ( 1825 – 34 ) . This was principally because opposition to the National Republicans was fragmented , exemplified by the Free Bridge Party and the Anti @-@ Masonic Party , the latter of which in particular siphoned off significant numbers of Democratic votes in the 1832 election . Despite attempts by both the National Republicans and the Democrats to woo the Anti @-@ Masons into their fold , neither was able to . Morton was mildly anti @-@ Mason , but Henshaw was a Freemason , and Morton apparently did not recognize the potential power of the Anti @-@ Masons despite their significant electoral showing . As a result , the Democrats lacked the voting strength to unseat the National Republicans . The Democrats were also splintered in 1832 and 1833 , when the Working Men 's Party drew support by attacking both of the larger parties for their lack of attention to labor issues . Morton was sufficiently disheartened by his repeated failures that he considered abandoning his quest for the governorship in 1832 ; Henshaw convinced him to soldier on . In 1831 Morton broke ranks with his friend John Calhoun over the latter 's support for nullification , which Morton believed was based on his support for slavery . This also caused fractures in the Massachusetts Democratic Party , with Henshaw siding with Calhoun and the southern Democrats .",
  "There is no record of Goya 's thoughts during this period . He completed the series during a period recuperating from illness , possibly lead poisoning , when he was in considerable mental and physical pain , and withdrew from public life . Witches ' Sabbath is believed to be a rather bitter , but silent , protest against the royalists and clergy who had retaken control of Spain after the Peninsular War of 1807 – 14 . Advocates of the Enlightenment had sought to redistribute land to the peasants , to educate women , publish a vernacular Bible and , by replacing superstition with reason , put an end to the Inquisition . Witch hunting , which occurred during the Logroño Inquisition , was appalling to idealist liberals such as Goya . As court painter Goya was a part of the established order ; surviving evidence indicates he was acquiesced to the wishes of his patrons . Yet numerous paintings and etchings have emerged since , suggesting he had convictions favouring liberalism , enlightenment , and reason . He seems to have kept such beliefs private , only expressing them in his private art ; his more sensitive works were not published at the time , probably for fear of reprisal or persecution . In Witches ' Sabbath Goya mocks and ridicules the superstition , fear and irrationality of the ignorant placing their faith in ghouls , quack doctors and tyrants .",

  "In 1930 the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) undertook a tour of the West Indies which included four Test matches — the first Tests to be played in the West Indies . The MCC side was not at full international strength ; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers , and several star English bowlers were missing . The first Test was played in Barbados and St Hill was selected , making his debut for the West Indies on 11 February 1930 . He scored 0 and 12 with the bat , took two for 110 from 35 overs in the first innings and was wicketless in the second . The match was drawn . The MCC then travelled to Trinidad and played the cricket team in two games . St Hill played in the first , taking four wickets , but was rested from the second . The Trinidad Sporting Chronicle stated that he was omitted specifically to be ready for the second Test , also played in Trinidad , although he had not asked for a rest . The newspaper questioned why he had then been left out of the team for the Test match , and reported speculation that his omission was for political reasons to discredit the leadership of George Dewhurst , the Trinidad captain in the second game . It suggested that , given his ability with bat and ball , St Hill was worth a net 100 runs to any team in which he played . Having been omitted from the second Test , which West Indies lost , St Hill played in the third in British Guiana . West Indies won the game ; St Hill batted at number eleven in the batting order in his first innings , at number five in the second and scored three runs in each innings . With the ball , he took only one wicket and did not play another Test . A review of the series in the Barbados Advocate suggested that St Hill bowled steadily during both his Test appearances , but that his economical bowling figures in British Guiana were slightly unrepresentative as the English batsmen had been concentrating entirely on defence . The article stated that St Hill was more effective on matting pitches than on turf , but that he had many supporters in Trinidad . It believed he warranted a place on the forthcoming West Indian tour of Australia , but that he needed to work on his fielding , which was weak .",

  "A complete Herrerasaurus skull was found in 1988 , by a team of paleontologists led by Paul Sereno .

However , Sereno favored classifying Herrerasaurus ( and the Herrerasauridae ) as primitive theropods . These two classifications have become the most persistent , with Rauhut ( 2003 ) and Bittencourt and Kellner ( 2004 ) favoring the early theropod hypothesis , and Max Langer ( 2004 ) , Langer and Benton ( 2006 ) , and Randall Irmis and his coauthors ( 2007 ) favoring the basal saurischian hypothesis .

This view is further supported by ichnological records showing large tridactyl ( three @-@ toed ) footprints that can be attributed only to a theropod dinosaur .

  "The C center corresponds to electrically neutral single substitutional nitrogen atoms in the diamond lattice . These are easily seen in electron paramagnetic resonance spectra ( in which they are confusingly called P1 centers ) .

  "Another feature of the French Revolutionary Wars was the effect of British blockade on French movements . The Royal Navy maintained an active close blockade of all major French ports during the conflict , which resulted in every French ship that left port facing attack from squadrons and individual ships patrolling the French and allied coasts . The losses the French Navy suffered as a result of this strategy were high , and the blockade was so effective that even movement between ports along the French coasts was restricted . In the Indian Ocean however the huge distances between the French bases on Réunion and Isle de France and the British bases in India meant that close blockade was an ineffective strategy : the scale of the forces required to maintain an effective constant blockade of both islands , as well as the Dutch ports at the Cape of Good Hope and in the Dutch East Indies were too large to be worth their deployment to such a distant part of the world . As a result , the French raiders operating from the Indian Ocean bases were able to travel with more freedom and less risk of interception than those in the Atlantic or Mediterranean .",

  "Ferrocene , [ Fe ( C5H5 ) 2 ] , was first synthesised in 1951 during an attempt to prepare the fulvalene ( C10H8 ) by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene ; the resultant product was found to have molecular formula C10H10Fe and reported to exhibit \" remarkable stability \" . The discovery sparked substantial interest in the field of organometallic chemistry , in part because the structure proposed by Pauson and Kealy ( shown at right ) was inconsistent with then @-@ existing bonding models and did not explain its unexpected stability . Consequently , the initial challenge was to definitively determine the structure of ferrocene in the hope that its bonding and properties would then be understood . The sandwich structure was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952 : Robert Burns Woodward and Geoffrey Wilkinson investigated the reactivity in order to determine the structure and demonstrated that ferrocene undergoes similar reactions to a typical aromatic molecule ( such as benzene ) , Ernst Otto Fischer deduced the sandwich structure and also began synthesising other metallocenes including cobaltocene ; Eiland and Pepinsky provided X @-@ ray crystallographic confirmation of the sandwich structure . Applying valence bond theory to ferrocene by considering an Fe2 + centre and two cyclopentadienide anions ( C5H5 − ) , which are known to be aromatic according to Hückel 's rule and hence highly stable , allowed correct prediction of the geometry of the molecule . Once molecular orbital theory was successfully applied , the reasons for ferrocene 's remarkable stability became clear .",

Food should preferably also be finely chopped , ground , pounded and strained to achieve a true mixture of all the ingredients . White wine was believed to be cooler than red and the same distinction was applied to red and white vinegar . Milk was moderately warm and moist , but the milk of different animals was often believed to differ . Egg yolks were considered to be warm and moist while the whites were cold and moist . Skilled cooks were expected to conform to the regimen of humoral medicine . Even if this limited the combinations of food they could prepare , there was still ample room for artistic variation by the chef .",

  "One reason for the change of strategy towards Scotland was a growing concern for the relationship between England and France . As long as Scotland and France were in an alliance , the English were faced with the prospect of fighting a war on two fronts . The French carried out raids on English coastal towns , leading to rumours in England of a full @-@ scale French invasion . In 1337 , Philip VI confiscated the English king 's duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Ponthieu . Instead of seeking a peaceful resolution to the conflict by paying homage to the French king , the way his father had done , Edward responded by laying claim to the French crown as the grandson of Philip IV . The French , however , invoked the Salic law of succession and rejected his claim . Instead , they upheld the rights of Philip IV 's nephew , King Philip VI ( an agnatic descendant of the House of France ) , thereby setting the stage for the Hundred Years ' War ( see family tree below ) . In the early stages of the war , Edward 's strategy was to build alliances with other Continental princes . In 1338 , Louis IV named Edward vicar @-@ general of the Holy Roman Empire and promised his support . As late as 1373 , the Anglo @-@ Portuguese Treaty of 1373 established an Anglo @-@ Portuguese Alliance . These measures , however , produced few results ; the only major military victory in this phase of the war was the English naval victory at Sluys on 24 June 1340 , which secured English control of the Channel .",

  "They are vulnerable to attack while watering but with a large number of birds milling about , predators find it difficult to select a target bird and are likely to have been spotted before they can get close to the flock . The choice of a watering site is influenced by the topography of the nearby ground . The sandgrouse tend to avoid sites with cover for mammalian predators and their greatest risk is usually from predatory birds . Sandgrouse travel tens of miles to their traditional water holes and tend to disregard temporary water sources which may appear periodically . This probably has a survival value because a dried up water source in an arid region could result in dehydration and death . The Burchell 's sandgrouse in the Kalahari Desert sometimes travels over 100 miles ( 160 km ) daily to reach a water source .

  "Notwithstanding their high price , the popularity of Bovet watches in China meant that the company had to contract with other Swiss manufacturers such as Guinand to help them meet demand . Even though Juvet Fleurier also sold pieces in China , it was not uncommon to see Bovet pieces with a Juvet movement . In the 1830s Bovet established a manufacturing facility in Canton , but because of restrictions resulting from the Opium Wars , they had to close that facility and open a smaller one in Macau . It was about this time that the company created a Chinese name to more effectively market to the middle class .

This presents Spears both as \" an object of desire and a punching bag \" . According to Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph , this line also hints at the public image of British singer Amy Winehouse .",

His criticism of such groups is the best known source of his century to describe Daoist beliefs .

  "In Hungary , the belief in vampires has existed since the Middle Ages , and bloodthirsty creatures are mentioned all over the Inquisition 's notes . In the 12th century , Hungarian inquisitors interrogated a pagan shaman during a trial in the city of Sárospatak , who claimed the existence of a demon , which was called \" izcacus \" ( which means blood drinker ) . That demon was described as a wild entity that could eventually be called to destroy the enemies of the pagans . The Hungarian experts estimate that this word 's origin dates back to the period before the Hungarians ' arrival in Europe in 895 . The word has its roots in the ancient Turkish language , with which the Hungarians made contact during the late 8th century in the regions between Asia and Europe .",

  "The Normans initially did not significantly alter the operation of the manor or the village economy . William reassigned large tracts of land amongst the Norman elite , creating vast estates in some areas , particularly along the Welsh border and in Sussex .

  "The Persians had now captured most of Greece , but Xerxes had perhaps not expected such defiance ; his priority was now to complete the war as quickly as possible . If Xerxes could destroy the Allied navy , he would be in a strong position to force an Allied surrender ; conversely by avoiding destruction , or as Themistocles hoped , by destroying the Persian fleet , the Allies could prevent conquest from being completed . The Allied fleet thus remained off the coast of Salamis into September , despite the imminent arrival of the Persians . Even after Athens fell , the Allied fleet remained off the coast of Salamis , trying to lure the Persian fleet to battle . Partly because of deception by Themistocles , the navies met in the cramped Straits of Salamis . There , the Persian numbers became a hindrance , as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganised . Seizing the opportunity , the Allied fleet attacked , and scored a decisive victory , sinking or capturing at least 200 Persian ships , therefore ensuring the safety of the Peloponnessus .",

  "Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga , a supporter of intelligent design , has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism , which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural , intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low .

Plantinga argues that whereas a God would be expected to create beings with reliable reasoning faculties , evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones , meaning that if evolution is true , it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true . This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments . It has also been argued that rationality , if conducive to survival , is more likely to be selected for than irrationality , making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones .",

Only 66 of the 67 entrants began the race , as María Isabel Moreno of Spain left the country days earlier after failing a drug test .",

  "Kerala has been a major spice exporter since 3000 BCE , according to Sumerian records and it is still referred to as the \" Garden of Spices \" or as the \" Spice Garden of India \" . Kerala 's spices attracted ancient Babylonians , Assyrians and Egyptians to the Malabar Coast in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BCE .

  "In a socioevolutionary approach , Durkheim described the evolution of societies from mechanical solidarity to organic solidarity ( one rising from mutual need ) . As the societies become more complex , evolving from mechanical to organic solidarity , the division of labour is counteracting and replacing collective consciousness . In the simpler societies , people are connected to others due to personal ties and traditions ; in the larger , modern society they are connected due to increased reliance on others with regard to them performing their specialized tasks needed for the modern , highly complex society to survive . In mechanical solidarity , people are self @-@ sufficient , there is little integration and thus there is the need for use of force and repression to keep society together . Also , in such societies , people have much fewer options in life . In organic solidarity , people are much more integrated and interdependent and specialisation and cooperation is extensive . Progress from mechanical to organic solidarity is based first on population growth and increasing population density , second on increasing \" morality density \" ( development of more complex social interactions ) and thirdly , on the increasing specialisation in workplace . One of the ways mechanical and organic societies differ is the function of law : in mechanical society the law is focused on its punitive aspect , and aims to reinforce the cohesion of the community , often by making the punishment public and extreme ; whereas in the organic society the law focuses on repairing the damage done and is more focused on individuals than the community .",

  "In early 1945 , planning was underway for Operation Oboe Two , an amphibious assault to capture Balikpapan , a seaport on Borneo . The 9th Division was originally designated for the operation , but in April it was decided to utilise the 7th Division instead , and it duly embarked from Cairns to Morotai , the staging post for the assault . Operation Oboe Two would transpire to be the largest amphibious operation mounted by the Australian military . Despite opposition from the American naval commanders providing support for the operation , Milford decided to land his forces at Klandasan , a southern suburb of Balikpapan which although heavily defended , had suitable beaches for landing troops . By landing at Klandasan , Milford hoped to achieve tactical surprise and anticipated fire support from the United States Navy would help counter the coastal defences of the Japanese . The battle of Balikpapan began on 1 July with a naval barrage of the landing area , supported by bombers of the Royal Australian Air Force , with the division landing relatively unopposed by mid morning . By 1pm , the beachhead was secure and Milford , together with Generals Douglas MacArthur and Leslie Morshead made an inspection of the area . At this late stage of the war it was clear that the war would soon end , and extensive use was made of divisional artillery ( which Milford had raised during his earlier spell with the division in 1940 ) rather than needlessly risk soldiers ' lives . By 21 July , Balikpapan was secure and the Japanese were retreating into Borneo . Milford ordered a halt to further offensive action and instructed his outlying forces to hold their position , thus concluding a successful operation .",

  "Although Herodotus presents the revolt as a consequence of Aristagoras and Histiaeus 's personal motives , it is clear that Ionia must have been ripe for rebellion anyway . The primary grievance was the tyrants installed by the Persians . While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants , this was a form of government on the decline . Moreover , past tyrants had tended ( and needed ) to be strong and able leaders , whereas the rulers appointed by the Persians were simply the representatives of the Persians . Backed by Persian military might , these tyrants did not need the support of the population , and could thus rule absolutely . Aristagoras 's actions have thus been likened to tossing a flame into a kindling box ; they incited rebellion across Ionia , and tyrannies were everywhere abolished , and democracies established in their place .",

  "The cup first appears in the records of the new Tudor dynasty under Henry VIII in 1521 . By now the cover had lost the finial \" garnished with four sapphires , three balas rubies and fifteen pearls \" described in Charles VI 's inventory and had a new one of gold in the form of a closed , or \" imperial \" crown .

The cup is described in inventories in 1532 and after Henry 's death in 1547 , and then under Elizabeth I it was inventoried in 1574 and 1596 .",

  "The first charter produced by \" Æthelstan A \" in 928 described the king as rex Anglorum , \" king of the English \" , the first time that title had been used . By 931 he had become \" king of the English , elevated by the right hand of the Almighty to the throne of the whole kingdom of Britain \" . Some charters were witnessed by Welsh kings , and occasionally by the kings of Scotland and Strathclyde , signifying acceptance of Æthelstan 's lordship . In Keynes 's view , it cannot be a coincidence that the charters commenced immediately after the conquest of Northumbria , and \" Æthelstan A \" ' s primary aim was to display the \" grandeur of Æthelstan 's kingship \" . Foot argues that the king 's inner circle quickly seized on the potential of the conquest for \" ideological aggrandizement of the king 's public standing \" .

  "By the time that Richard II was deposed in 1399 , the power of the major noble magnates had grown considerably ; powerful rulers such as Henry IV would contain them , but during the minority of Henry VI they controlled the country . The magnates depended upon their income from rent and trade to allow them to maintain groups of paid , armed retainers , often sporting controversial livery , and buy support amongst the wider gentry ; this system has been dubbed bastard feudalism . Their influence was exerted both through the House of Lords at Parliament and through the king 's council . The gentry and wealthier townsmen exercised increasing influence through the House of Commons , opposing raising taxes to pay for the French wars . By the 1430s and 1440s the English government was in major financial difficulties , leading to the crisis of 1450 and a popular revolt under the leadership of Jack Cade .

The resulting Wars of the Roses saw a savage escalation of violence between the noble leaderships of both sides : captured enemies were executed and family lands attainted . By the time that Henry VII took the throne in 1485 , England 's governmental and social structures had been substantially weakened , with whole noble lines extinguished .",

Dune 2000 was panned by critics , though Klepacki 's score was praised for adhering to the traditional Dune style . Klepacki considered 2000 to be a more definitive work than Dune 2 , which was constrained by software and hardware limitations . He composed for Command & Conquer : Tiberian Sun with Jarrid Mendelson — with whom he would later collaborate on Emperor : Battle for Dune . He began by writing Stomp , an energetic rock piece intended to recreate the effect of Hell March for the new game . Coincidentally , one of the trailers for Command and Conquer 3 featured ' Stomp ' as the soundtrack . Westwood instead wanted Tiberian Sun to feature darker , more moody music , and Stomp was shelved in favor of the current sound . Bereft of ideas due to the stark change in direction , Klepacki asked Mendelson to collaborate ; he regards tracks they both worked on as the best . Tiberian Sun ultimately featured dark , ambient techno music and ambient space music suited to the game 's post @-@ apocalyptic and futuristic setting . Klepacki cited the piece \" Mad Rap \" as his favorite . An avid Star Wars fan , he enjoyed scoring cut scenes featuring James Earl Jones , the voice of Darth Vader . The scenes also allowed him to integrate the Airstrike and No Mercy themes into the game 's score despite the aforementioned shift . With the expansion pack Firestorm , he attempted to \" set things right \" by writing more upbeat songs and including Stomp , which would also appear in Command & Conquer : Renegade .",

  "Because of the loss of his father , Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven , selling newspapers and doing other odd jobs to help his family , who had lost the family store and their home . He quickly learned the newsboy 's patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him . According to later accounts , Skelton 's early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923 , when a stranger , supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn , approached Skelton , who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater . When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town , Skelton suggested he see the new show in town . The man purchased every paper Skelton had , providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself . The stranger turned out to be one of the show 's stars , who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers . The experience prompted Skelton , who had already shown comedic tendencies , to pursue a career as a performer .",
  "The contract for Wyandotte , the only Navy ship to be named after the Wyandotte Indian Tribe , was awarded to Miles Greenwood ; the ship was laid down on 28 September 1862 at the shipyard of John Litherbury in Cincinnati , Ohio . She was launched on 22 December 1864 and completed on 15 February 1866 . The ship 's construction was delayed by multiple changes ordered while she was being built that reflected battle experience with earlier monitors . This included the rebuilding of the turrets and pilot houses to increase their armor thickness from 8 inches ( 203 mm ) to 10 inches and to replace the bolts that secured their armor plates together with rivets to prevent them from being knocked loose by the shock of impact from shells striking the turret . Other changes included deepening the hull by 18 inches ( 457 mm ) to increase the ship 's buoyancy , moving the position of the turret to balance the ship 's trim and replacing all of the ship 's deck armor . Completion of the ship was further delayed by the low depth of the Ohio River which prevented her movement from Cincinnati in December 1864 to finish their fitting out . The river finally rose in March 1865 which allowed the ship to reach New Albany , Indiana on 14 March . Wyandotte was moved to Evansville , Indiana in late May to complete her hull where rudimentary facilities and illness among her workers delayed her construction still further .",

  "The Eskaya , less commonly known as the Visayan @-@ Eskaya , is the collective name for the members of a cultural minority found in Bohol , Philippines , which is distinguished by its cultural heritage , particularly its literature , language , dress and religious observances . After the Eskaya first came to public attention in 1980 , these cultural practices were the subject of intense speculation on the part of local journalists and amateur historians who made diverse claims about the ethnolinguistic status of the Eskaya people . The unique Eskayan language and writing system in particular has been a source of fascination and controversy . Some journalists argued that the Eskaya were historically displaced from the Middle East , while others suggested that the community was a cult speaking an invented language . According to Eskaya mythology , the language and script was created through divine inspiration by the ancestor Pinay who based it on the human body . Suppressed by the Spanish colonists , Pinay 's language was said to have resurfaced under the leadership of Mariano Datahan ( ca . 1875 – 1949 ) , a veteran of Bohol 's republican army . Although the historical existence of Pinay cannot be confirmed , more recent studies that combined linguistic analysis with oral history and genealogical research provide evidence that the Eskaya language was most likely created and disseminated within a generation by a charismatic individual .

  "By 494 BC the Persian army and navy had regrouped , and they made straight for the epicentre of the rebellion at Miletus . The Ionian fleet sought to defend Miletus by sea , but was defeated decisively at the Battle of Lade , after the Samians had defected . Miletus was then besieged , captured , and its population was enslaved . This double defeat effectively ended the revolt , and the Carians surrendered to the Persians as a result . The Persians spent 493 BC reducing the cities along the west coast that still held out against them , before finally imposing a peace settlement on Ionia that was considered to be both just and fair .",
  "Organisms differ in how many of the molecules in their cells they can construct for themselves . Autotrophs such as plants can construct the complex organic molecules in cells such as polysaccharides and proteins from simple molecules like carbon dioxide and water . Heterotrophs , on the other hand , require a source of more complex substances , such as monosaccharides and amino acids , to produce these complex molecules . Organisms can be further classified by ultimate source of their energy : photoautotrophs and photoheterotrophs obtain energy from light , whereas chemoautotrophs and chemoheterotrophs obtain energy from inorganic oxidation reactions .",

The party 's traditional attachment to equality was reduced : Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome . The Commission on Social Justice , set up by John Smith , reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were : equal worth of citizens , equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs , the requirement to spread opportunities as much as possible , and the need to remove unjustified inequalities . The party viewed social justice primarily as the requirement to give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship .

  "In the citric acid cycle , all the intermediates ( e.g. citrate , iso @-@ citrate , alpha @-@ ketoglutarate , succinate , fumarate , malate and oxaloacetate ) are regenerated during each turn of the cycle . Adding more of any of these intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle , increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other . Hence , the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect , and its removal has a cataplerotic effect . These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will , during the course of the cycle , increase or decrease the amount of oxaloacetate available to combine with acetyl @-@ CoA to form citric acid . This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion , and thus the availability of ATP to the cell .",
  "Because of the absence of RNA proofreading enzymes , the RNA @-@ dependent RNA polymerase that copies the viral genome makes an error roughly every 10 thousand nucleotides , which is the approximate length of the influenza vRNA . Hence , the majority of newly manufactured influenza viruses are mutants ; this causes antigenic drift , which is a slow change in the antigens on the viral surface over time . The separation of the genome into eight separate segments of vRNA allows mixing or reassortment of vRNAs if more than one type of influenza virus infects a single cell . The resulting rapid change in viral genetics produces antigenic shifts , which are sudden changes from one antigen to another . These sudden large changes allow the virus to infect new host species and quickly overcome protective immunity . This is important in the emergence of pandemics , as discussed below in the section on Epidemiology .",

  "The architecture of the Windows Push Notification Service is similar to that of its predecessor , in that it consists of servers and interfaces that generate , maintain , store , and authenticate unique identifiers ( called Channel URI Identifiers ) for all devices that register to use the service . When a device enrolls to receive data and notification information using the WNS , it first sends a device registration request to WNS network . The WNS network acknowledges the request , and responds with the device 's unique Channel URI Identifier . Typically , the device will then send its identifier to a server owned by the developer so that it can be stored and used for sending notifications . When the app developer wishes to transmit a notification or other WNS data to the device , it will transmit a POST request to the WNS network . The network will acknowledge and authenticate the request .

  "Argentina 's geomorphic characteristics make the country highly vulnerable to floods . These floods can damage infrastructure , cause loss of life , increase the risk of diseases , and negatively impact agricultural productivity , which is one of the main economic activities of the country . Many of the large Argentinean cities and agriculturally productive areas lie near rivers . The plains are at highest risk for flooding , particularly in the northeastern and central parts of the country , including Greater Buenos Aires . This is because these plains , which cover 35 % of the land area in the country ( including the Chaco and Pampean areas ) , are characterized by a flat landscape , which can impede proper water drainage . Both the Parana and Paraguay basins have a flat landscape and are thus highly susceptible to flooding due to river overflows following high rainfall . These floods can last for months , particularly in the Parana River , owing to its large basin . In the most extreme case , during the year 1982 – 1983 , the floods in the Parana River persisted for more than a year , negatively impacting the area both socially and economically . Major flooding events in the Parana River include those of 1992 and 1997 and have been more frequent since the 1980s due to higher precipitation trends . Similarly , in Buenos Aires Province , flooding occurs due to river overflows and poor water drainage ; major flooding events in the province occurred in 1987 , 2002 / 2003 , 2012 and in 2014 , causing damage to agriculture production . Most of the flooding events occur in El Niño years owing to higher rainfall . Flooding can also affect Patagonia and urban centers in the northwest , but the number of people affected and economic losses are lower than those in the Pampas owing to lower population densities . Flooding can jeopardize access to safe water . A leptospirosis outbreak occurred following a flood in 1998 .",
  "With around 1600 pages in manuscript length , A Dance with Dragons was eventually published in July 2011 after six years of writing , longer in page count and writing time than any of the preceding four novels . The story of A Dance with Dragons catches up and goes beyond A Feast for Crows around two @-@ thirds into the book , but nevertheless covers less story than Martin had intended , omitting at least one planned large battle sequence and leaving several character threads ending in cliff @-@ hangers . Martin attributed the delay mainly to his untangling \" the Meereenese knot \" , which the interviewer understood as \" making the chronology and characters mesh up as various threads converged on [ Daenerys ] \" . Martin also acknowledged spending too much time on rewriting and perfecting the story , but soundly rejected the theories of his more extravagant critics that he had lost interest in the series or would bide his time to make more money .",

Phillip 's attorney , public defender Susan Gellman , alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly . Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom , but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010 . Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury , and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately .

Tapson said he found out about Gellman 's plans only late on April 6 . Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury .

  "When the war ended and the United States turned its focus toward rebuilding , Roebling started building his Brooklyn Bridge . As the monumental task could affect naval navigation , it required state approval , and the government wanted a thorough review of the engineer 's credentials ; hence , a Bridge Party was organized . Comprising Roebling and his son , as well as their fellow bridge engineers , generals , businessmen , and high society figures , the party toured the country to review four bridges Roebling had built before the civil war . The final item on their itinerary was Roebling 's Niagara Suspension Bridge . At the dinner to commemorate the end of the bridge tour , civil war veteran General Henry Warner Slocum gave a toast and called the Suspension Bridge a symbol of inspiration for the United States in its rebuilding efforts . This sentiment was shared by the guests and was expressed at later dinners across the United States . The achievement of building a large suspension bridge over a gorge in the face of overwhelming adversity — constant put @-@ downs by the professional community , American and European — gave the United States a sense of pride . Nationalism rose as the country lauded the bridge . The completion of the bridge that had been deemed impossible by the Western world gave Americans , who had lesser technical accomplishments than Europe at that time , a trophy that stood above any other . The Suspension Bridge became the American symbol to brave the toughest of challenges and do the impossible , pushing their drive for industrialization even harder . Charles W. Woodman specifically drew attention to the Suspension Bridge in his 1865 address to the United States Senate for approval to build a rail system to transport a ship out of the water and up around the Niagara Falls .",

  "After selecting the landing site for Apollo 16 , sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations , two geologic units of the lunar highlands , was determined by mission planners to be the primary sampling interest of the mission .

  "Although he came to Hamburg to work with Pauli , Rabi found Otto Stern working there with two English @-@ speaking postdoctoral fellows , Ronald Fraser and John Bradshaw Taylor . Rabi soon made friends with them , and became interested in their molecular beam experiments , for which Stern would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1943 . Their research involved non @-@ uniform magnetic fields , which were difficult to manipulate and hard to measure accurately . Rabi came up with the idea of using a uniform field instead , with the molecular beam at a glancing angle , so the atoms would be deflected like light through a prism . This would be easier to use , and produce more accurate results . Encouraged by Stern , and greatly assisted by Taylor , Rabi managed to get his idea to work . On Stern 's advice , Rabi wrote a letter about his results to Nature , which published it in February 1929 , followed by a paper entitled Zur Methode der Ablenkung von Molekularstrahlen ( \" On the method of deflection of molecular beams \" ) to Zeitschrift für Physik , where it was published in April .",
  "Neither Ralph of Coggeshall nor William of Newburgh offer an explanation for the \" strange and prodigious \" event , as William calls it , and some modern historians have the same reticence : \" I consider the process of worrying over the suggestive details of these wonderfully pointless miracles in an effort to find natural or psychological explanations of what ' really , ' if anything , happened , to be useless to the study of William of Newburgh or , for that matter , of the Middle Ages \" , says Nancy Partner , author of a study of 12th @-@ century historiography . Nonetheless , such explanations continue to be sought and two approaches have dominated explanations of the mystery of the green children . The first is that the narrative descends from folklore , describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of a \" fairy Otherworld \" . In a few early as well as modern readings , this other world is extraterrestrial , and the green children alien beings . The second is that it is a garbled account of a real event , although it is impossible to be certain whether the story as recorded is an authentic report given by the children or an \" adult invention \" . His study of accounts of children and servants fleeing from their masters led Charles Oman to conclude that \" there is clearly some mystery behind it all [ the story of the green children ] , some story of drugging and kidnapping \" . Jeffrey Jerome Cohen offers a different kind of historical explanation , arguing that the story is an oblique account of the racial difference between the contemporary English and the indigenous Britons .",
  "There has been some resistance within the astronomical community toward the reclassification . Alan Stern , principal investigator with NASA 's New Horizons mission to Pluto , publicly derided the IAU resolution , stating that \" the definition stinks , for technical reasons \" . Stern 's contention was that , by the terms of the new definition , Earth , Mars , Jupiter , and Neptune , all of which share their orbits with asteroids , would be excluded . He argued that all big spherical moons , including the Moon , should likewise be considered planets . His other claim was that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it , the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community . Marc W. Buie , then at Lowell Observatory , voiced his opinion on the new definition on his website and petitioned against the definition . Others have supported the IAU . Mike Brown , the astronomer who discovered Eris , said \" through this whole crazy circus @-@ like procedure , somehow the right answer was stumbled on . It 's been a long time coming .

  "The JNA Knin Corps , which had already fully mobilised and deployed , started the campaign in northern Dalmatia and southern Lika on 16 September 1991 . It captured Drniš on 18 September , but sustained defeats at Pakovo Selo two days later and near Šibenik on 22 September as it attempted to capture the city . After this defeat , the Corps ceased its attacks , except for those around Gospić in Lika , for the rest of the month . Five days after the JNA and the Serbian Guard paramilitaries lost their positions in the city on 22 September , the Knin Corps captured Lovinac . JNA troops assembling near the southern tip of Croatia in the Dubrovnik hinterland consisted of elements of the Užice and Titograd Corps . They had not advanced onto Croatian soil by the end of September because of mobilisation problems in Bosnia and Herzegovina . In Banovina , the JNA captured Petrinja on 21 September , but failed to make further progress . Because of the failure of JNA mobilisation , the planned campaign in Kordun was limited to the consolidation of positions held around Karlovac . On 15 September , the Yugoslav Navy blockaded the Croatian Adriatic ports of Pula , Rijeka , Zadar , Split and Dubrovnik for a week .",

  "In 1997 , comparisons of repeated DNA sequences within the family Indriidae supported Simon 's classification , placing the golden @-@ crowned sifaka as a sister group to the other sifakas . In 2001 , a study involving mitochondrial DNA suggested a very recent divergence between it and the Coquerel 's sifaka , then considered a subspecies of the P. verreauxi group . If this were true , the golden @-@ crowned sifaka would not merit species status and would form a subclade with the Coquerel 's sifaka within the P. verreauxi group . In 2004 , a comparative study of the karyotypes of the three traditional species of sifakas provided insight into the chromosomal arrangements of all three groups . This study found that the golden @-@ crowned sifaka differs from P. verreauxi group and P. diadema group by 9 and 17 chromosomal rearrangements respectively , and conversely argued that the golden @-@ crowned sifaka is indeed a separate species and is more closely related to the P. verreauxi group .

It also placed the golden @-@ crowned sifaka within the P. verreauxi group .",
  "Bucer 's time in England was dogged by illnesses , including rheumatism , coughs , and intestinal ailments . Symptoms such as vomiting , shivering , and sweating suggest severe tuberculosis . In February 1551 , his health finally broke down , and on the 22nd he dictated an addition to his will . He named Walter Haddon and Matthew Parker as executors , commended his loved ones to Thomas Cranmer , and thanked his stepdaughter Agnes Capito for taking care of him . On 28 February , after encouraging those near him to do all they could to realise his vision as expressed in De Regno Christi , he died at the age of 59 .

During this period he was also involved in drafting education bills with Arthur Thring . The commission was \" a galaxy of future Whitehall stars \" , and contained many individuals who would later become noted civil servants in their own right , including Morant , Schuster , John Anderson , Warren Fisher and John Bradbury . The contacts Schuster made during his time on the committee were instrumental in advancing his career ; as a lawyer rather than a dedicated civil servant he was considered an outsider , and the links he made – particularly the friendships he struck up with Fisher and Anderson – helped allay this to some extent .",
  "Foraker became popular during his governorship for \" waving the bloody shirt \" , that is , castigating the South for the Civil War . President Cleveland in 1887 requested northern governors to return captured Confederate battle flags . When Foraker was asked by a supporter if he would allow the banners to go South , he responded by telegraph , \" No rebel flags will be returned while I am governor . \" Cleveland backed down , and Foraker was hailed as a hero by many , receiving thousands of congratulatory messages . Foraker criticized the President for vetoing a bill increasing war pensions and for going fishing on Decoration Day . When the governor visited Philadelphia later that year for the centennial of the Constitution , he rode at the head of a regiment of Ohio militia past the reviewing stand on which Cleveland stood . When Foraker saluted , Cleveland removed his hat , but did not bow slightly as he had for other state governors .

  "Retrograde signaling is a hypothesis that attempts to explain that , while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically , some evidence suggests that it is expressed presynaptically as well . The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell . For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically , a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a retrograde ( reverse ) direction . Once there , the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression , such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release .",

  "In the years between his return from Paris in 1908 and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 , Vaughan Williams increasingly established himself as a figure in British music . For a rising composer it was important to receive performances at the big provincial music festivals , which generated publicity and royalties . In 1910 his music featured at two of the largest and most prestigious festivals , with the premieres of the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis at the Three Choirs Festival in Gloucester Cathedral in September and A Sea Symphony at the Leeds Festival the following month . The leading British music critics of the time , J. A. Fuller Maitland of The Times and Samuel Langford of The Manchester Guardian , were strong in their praise .

The conquistadores were met with a barrage of stones , spears , arrows , boiling water mixed with lime and ash , and found the nearby town defended by a formidable 1 @.@ 2 @-@ metre ( 4 ft ) thick defensive wall fashioned from stone and earth and reinforced with treetrunks . The Tzotzil mocked the Spanish , hurling small quantities of gold at them and inviting them to try and take the rest that they had within their walls . The Spanish stormed the wall , to find that the inhabitants had left spears planted inside to make the Spanish think that warriors were still defending the town , when they had actually withdrawn under cover of torrential rain that had interrupted the battle . After taking the deserted Chamula , the Spanish expedition continued against their allies at Huixtan . Again the inhabitants offered armed resistance before abandoning their town to the Spanish . Conquistador Diego Godoy wrote that the Indians killed or captured at Huixtan numbered no more than 500 . The Spanish , by now disappointed with the scarce pickings , decided to retreat to Coatzacoalcos in May 1524 .",
  "To complete the coup d 'état and legitimize his claim to the throne , Helmichis married the queen , whose high standing arose not only from being the king 's widow but also from being the most prominent member of the remaining Gepid nation , and as such her support was a guarantee of the Gepids ' loyalty to Helmichis . The latter could also count on the support of the Lombard garrison of Verona , where many may have opposed Alboin 's aggressive policy and could have cultivated the hope of reaching an entente with the Empire .

  "A megamaser is a type of astrophysical maser , which is a naturally occurring source of stimulated spectral line emission . Megamasers are distinguished from astrophysical masers by their large isotropic luminosity . Megamasers have typical luminosities of 103 solar luminosities ( L ☉ ) , which is 100 million times brighter than masers in the Milky Way , hence the prefix mega . Likewise , the term kilomaser is used to describe masers outside the Milky Way that have luminosities of order L ☉ , or thousands of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way , gigamaser is used to describe masers billions of times stronger than the average maser in the Milky Way , and extragalactic maser encompasses all masers found outside the Milky Way . Most known extragalactic masers are megamasers , and the majority of megamasers are hydroxyl ( OH ) megamasers , meaning the spectral line being amplified is one due to a transition in the hydroxyl molecule . There are known megamasers for three other molecules : water ( H2O ) , formaldehyde ( H2CO ) , and methine ( CH ) .",

TMNT , executive produced by the TMNT co @-@ creator Peter Laird , is disparate from the previous and subsequent films ' live action style as the only CGI film in the franchise to date . Writer / director Kevin Munroe said that he wanted to do total CGI instead of live action and CGI turtles because it would be easier for the audience to \" suspend disbelief for such an offbeat story \" as there would be no break in the reality between CGI and live action . Producer Tom Gray explained that the decision to depart from the live action series was due to escalating budgets for the three films , and with each film making less than its predecessor , a CGI film became a reality . For example , the first film made $ 135 @.@ 2 million on a budget of $ 13 @.@ 5 million , and the third made $ 44 million on a budget of $ 21 million .

When developing the screenplay , Munroe wanted to take on a less lighthearted tone or \" less Cowabunga \" and place an emphasis on dark elements as shown in the original comics to appeal to the mature audience . \" I had a very specific tone because mixing that sort of action and comedy is a very specific thing . Most people were just coming and wanting to make it too funny . I think that version of the movie could do really well , but we wanted to do something where it sort of pushes the envelope a little bit more and says that animation is more than just comedic animals bumping into each other and farting ! \" Munroe said that in design and in the rendering of the animation , he was after the feel of a comic book .

  "Taking up the zebra example , Kerr proposed that the vertical lines of ships ' masts be disrupted with irregular white bands .

For example , he proposes to paint ships ' guns grey on top , grading to white below , so the guns would disappear against a grey background . Similarly , he advised painting shaded parts of the ship white , and brightly lit parts in grey , again with smooth grading between them , making shapes and structures invisible . Kerr was thus hoping to achieve both a measure of invisibility and a degree of confusion for the enemy using a rangefinder .
