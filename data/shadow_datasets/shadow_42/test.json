Edwin Chadwick proposed the closure of all existing burial grounds in the vicinity of London other than the privately owned Kensal Green Cemetery northwest of the city , which was to be nationalised and greatly enlarged to provide a single burial ground for west London .

  "After his return to Australia late in February 1942 , McCauley briefly served as Senior Air Staff Officer at North @-@ Western Area Headquarters in Darwin , Northern Territory . He took up the position of Deputy Chief of the Air Staff ( DCAS ) in May , and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) in the 1943 King 's Birthday Honours , promulgated on 2 June . The honour recognised the \" courage , ability , and qualities of leadership \" he displayed under \" trying and difficult conditions during a period of service in the Far East \" . The following month , he was promoted to temporary air commodore . During an inspection of No. 10 Group at Nadzab in March 1944 , McCauley learned that unless the Australian formation was able to increase its operational rate of effort , its units would be withdrawn from their forward airfields . As a result , RAAF Headquarters increased the supply of pilots and equipment to the group , which was then able to meet , and later exceed , the rate of effort achieved by comparable US Fifth Air Force units . At around this time , he also instigated a research program to determine a suitable formula for rotating and relieving ground staff , as well as aircrew , in the tropics .",

  "Genetic analysis of Sumatran rhino populations has identified three distinct genetic lineages . The channel between Sumatra and Malaysia was not as significant a barrier for the rhinos as the Barisan Mountains along the length of Sumatra , for rhinos in eastern Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia are more closely related than the rhinos on the other side of the mountains in western Sumatra . In fact , the eastern Sumatra and Malaysia rhinos show so little genetic variance , the populations were likely not separate during the Pleistocene , when sea levels were much lower and Sumatra formed part of the mainland . Both populations of Sumatra and Malaysia , however , are close enough genetically that interbreeding would not be problematic . The rhinos of Borneo are sufficiently distinct that conservation geneticists have advised against crossing their lineages with the other populations . Conservation geneticists have recently begun to study the diversity of the gene pool within these populations by identifying microsatellite loci . The results of initial testing found levels of variability within Sumatran rhino populations comparable to those in the population of the less endangered African rhinos , but the genetic diversity of Sumatran rhinos is an area of continuing study .",

This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics , and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience . The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise , as for example in John von Neumann 's 1958 book , The Computer and the Brain . Over the years , though , accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism .",

  "Banksia oblongifolia plants can live for more than 60 years . They respond to bushfire by resprouting from buds located on the large woody lignotuber . Larger lignotubers have the greatest number of buds , although buds are more densely spaced on smaller lignotubers . A 1988 field study in Ku @-@ ring @-@ gai Chase National Park found that shoots grow longer after fire , particularly one within the previous four years , and that new buds grow within six months after a fire . These shoots are able to grow , flower and set seed two to three years after a fire . The woody infructescences also release seeds as their follicles are opened with heat , although a proportion do open spontaneously at other times . One field study in Ku @-@ ring @-@ gai Chase National Park found 10 % opened in the absence of bushfire , and that seeds germinated , and young plants do grow . Older plants are serotinous , that is , they store large numbers of seed in an aerial seed bank in their canopy that are released after fire .

  "The origin of Inari worship is not entirely clear . The first recorded use of the present @-@ day kanji ( characters ) of Inari 's name , which mean \" carrying rice \" , ( literally \" rice load \" ) was in the Ruijū Kokushi in 892 AD .

Trolleycar was initially envisioned as a fictitious amphibious assault upon the coast of the Netherlands , by the phantom British Fourth Army , to exploit the success of the authentic Operation Market Garden . When the Battle of Arnhem failed , the notional invasion plan was temporarily scrapped . Trolleycar was revived to convince the Germans that the Fourth Army would land near Emden , in support of an imaginary assault by the First Canadian Army , that would be launched west of Arnhem and through the Netherlands . The deception effort was kept up until 1945 , being wound down in January . Despite the British ceasing their attempts to deceive the Germans about this possible landing and the Germans not believing all that had been reported to them , the Germans remained anxious about a landing along the northern coast for the remainder of the war .",

  "In the scenario of the British war effort and the threat from the militant movement in India , it was a major factor for the passage of the Defence of India Act 1915 . Among the strongest proponents of the act was Michael O 'Dwyer , then the Lieutenant Governor of Punjab , and this was largely due to the Ghadarite movement . It was also a factor that guided British political concessions and Whitehall 's India Policy during and after World War I , including the passage of Montagu – Chelmsford Reforms which initiated the first round of political reform in the Indian subcontinent in 1917 . The events of the conspiracy during World War I , the presence of Pratap 's Kabul mission in Afghanistan and its possible links to the Soviet Union , and a still @-@ active revolutionary movement especially in Punjab and Bengal ( as well as worsening civil unrest throughout India ) led to the appointment of a Sedition committee in 1918 chaired by Sidney Rowlatt , an English judge .

On the recommendations of the committee , the Rowlatt Act , an extension of the Defence of India Act 1915 , was enforced in India .",

  "After moving ashore , Beryl quickly weakened to a tropical depression . It slowed due to the weakening ridge to its north , and an approaching cold front turned it to the north and northeast on May 29 . Despite being well inland , Beryl retained enough convection to remain a tropical cyclone . As Beryl approached the Atlantic Ocean on May 30 , its convection increased to the south and east of the center , although the intrusion of dry air resulted in a ragged appearance on satellite imagery . Based on reports from ships , Beryl was upgraded to a tropical storm on May 30 near the South Carolina coastline . The approaching front caused the storm to accelerate northeastward . Beryl 's circulation became elongated and its associated convection spread northward , suggesting the transition into an extratropical cyclone . By late on May 30 , Beryl became extratropical , prompting the NHC to discontinue advisories . The storm continued to the northeast , later turning to the east @-@ southeast . On June 2 , a larger extratropical storm absorbed the remnants of Beryl to the southeast of Newfoundland .",

  "That hops could be used for flavoring beer had been known at least since Carolingian times , but was adopted gradually due to difficulties in establishing the appropriate proportions . Before the widespread use of hops , gruit , a mix of various herbs , had been used . Gruit had the same preserving properties as hops , though less reliable depending on what herbs were in it , and the end result was much more variable . Another flavoring method was to increase the alcohol content , but this was more expensive and lent the beer the undesired characteristic of being a quick and heavy intoxicant .

Andrić 's most vocal Bosniak detractors were Šukrija Kurtović , Adil Zulfikarpašić , Muhamed Filipović and Muhsin Rizvić , who accused him of everything from plagiarism to being a Serb nationalist , and made remarks insinuating that he was a homosexual . Some went so far as to call for his Nobel Prize to be taken away . A few of these scholars censured Andrić in the late 1950s , but most Bosniak criticism of his works appeared in the period immediately before the breakup of Yugoslavia and in the aftermath of the Bosnian War . In early 1992 , a Bosniak nationalist in Višegrad destroyed a statue of Andrić with a sledgehammer . Twenty years later , in 2012 , filmmaker Emir Kusturica and Bosnian Serb President Milorad Dodik unveiled another statue of Andrić in Višegrad , this time as part of the construction of an ethno @-@ town called Andrićgrad , sponsored by Kusturica and the Government of Republika Srpska . In June 2014 , Andrićgrad was officially opened on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand .",

The conjectural site of the early castle later became known as \" Boley Hill \" .

  "John Donovan of Sports Illustrated praised both teams for how unexpected their reaching the World Series was , saying that they were \" not supposed to be here . \" He also called the series a \" blast from the past \" because both teams were very old franchises and had twice previously met in the World Series .

Ultimately he concluded that Schilling and Martinez would be the \" key to [ the ] Series \" and that the Red Sox would win in six games . Jim Molony of MLB.com , said he expected the series to play out very differently from the last time the two teams met in the World Series in 1967 . This was because both team offenses had been some of the best in the league during the season , while pitching had been very dominant in 1967 .",
  "Another quandary is that if the precogs visions are infallible then the future cannot be otherwise , while if they are incorrect people will be punished for crimes they will never commit .

In the first example , Agatha knows what Anderton will freely choose to do when presented with specific facts so she provides them to him , and , in the second , she knows what will have happened to the Anderton 's son based on specific scenarios throughout his life , in which she can see what he would have freely chosen to do , and what selections various people in his life would have freely made . According to Kowalski , the PreCrime unit therefore removes individuals from precise situations where they would freely choose to become a murderer .",

One way she does this is through extensive use of \" imaginative \" writing that forces the reader to become a participant in the events narrated .",

Some species are myrmecophiles , forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection . Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous . Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps .",

  "Little egrets are sociable birds and are often seen in small flocks . Nevertheless , individual birds do not tolerate others coming too close to their chosen feeding site , though this depends on the abundance of prey . They use a variety of methods to procure their food ; they stalk their prey in shallow water , often running with raised wings or shuffling their feet to disturb small fish , or may stand still and wait to ambush prey . They make use of opportunities provided by cormorants disturbing fish or humans attracting fish by throwing bread into water . On land they walk or run while chasing their prey , feed on creatures disturbed by grazing livestock and ticks on the livestock , and even scavenge . Their diet is mainly fish , but amphibians , small reptiles , mammals and birds are also eaten , as well as crustaceans , molluscs , insects , spiders and worms .",

  "Antibiotics are not usually used for gastroenteritis , although they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected . If antibiotics are to be employed , a macrolide ( such as azithromycin ) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates of resistance to the latter . Pseudomembranous colitis , usually caused by antibiotic use , is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin . Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi , and Giardia species .

  "North Wales has had human settlements since prehistoric times . By the time the Romans reached Britain , the area that is now Clwyd was occupied by the Celtic Deceangli tribe . They lived in a chain of hill forts running through the Clwydian Range and their tribal capital was Canovium at an important river crossing on the River Conwy . This fell to the Romans , who built their own fort here , in about 75 AD and the whole of Wales was soon under their control . After the Roman departure from Britain in 410 AD , the successor states of Gwynedd and Powys controlled what is now Clwyd . From about 800 onwards , a series of dynastic marriages led to Rhodri Mawr inheriting the kingdoms of Gwynedd and Powys . After his death , this kingdom was divided among his three sons and further strife followed , with not only Welsh battles being fought , but also many raids by Danes and Saxons .",

  "La Rivière also cites external influences that , in his view , did not work in favour of The Secret Service . He expounds the continuing popularity of earlier Supermarionation productions as far back as The Adventures of Twizzle ( 1959 ) and the frequent repeat runs that they had on ATV throughout the 1960s : \" ... as with anything that is phenomenally popular , the time must come when the audience is satiated and drifts away to something else . \" Fryer suggests that the espionage theme may not have been attractive to potential foreign buyers , noting that the American spy series The Man from U.N.C.L.E. had been cancelled in 1968 and that the last episode of The Avengers had aired in the UK the following year . Fryer considers the \" making a spy series just when the fad for the genre was waning \" the biggest problem that faced The Secret Service in finding an audience . On the other hand , it is argued that , in light of the release of Century 21 's Doppelgänger ( 1969 ) , a live @-@ action film that preceded UFO , the Supermarionation format had become outdated .

  "The 1993 – 94 UEFA Champions League saw Linfield drawn with Dynamo Tbilisi of Georgia .

  "The growth of the inner core may be expected to consume most of the outer core by some 3 – 4 billion years from now , resulting in a nearly solid core composed of iron and other heavy elements . The surviving liquid envelope will mainly consist of lighter elements that will undergo less mixing . Alternatively , if at some point plate tectonics comes to an end , the interior will cool less efficiently , which may end the growth of the inner core . In either case , this can result in the loss of the magnetic dynamo . Without a functioning dynamo , the magnetic field of the Earth will decay in a geologically short time period of roughly 10 @,@ 000 years . The loss of the magnetosphere will cause an increase in erosion of light elements , particularly hydrogen , from the Earth 's outer atmosphere into space , resulting in less favorable conditions for life .",

  "Electrode selection is based primarily on the composition of the metal being welded , the process variation being used , joint design and the material surface conditions . Electrode selection greatly influences the mechanical properties of the weld and is a key factor of weld quality . In general the finished weld metal should have mechanical properties similar to those of the base material with no defects such as discontinuities , entrained contaminants or porosity within the weld . To achieve these goals a wide variety of electrodes exist . All commercially available electrodes contain deoxidizing metals such as silicon , manganese , titanium and aluminum in small percentages to help prevent oxygen porosity . Some contain denitriding metals such as titanium and zirconium to avoid nitrogen porosity . Depending on the process variation and base material being welded the diameters of the electrodes used in GMAW typically range from 0 @.@ 7 to 2 @.@ 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 028 – 0 @.@ 095 in ) but can be as large as 4 mm ( 0 @.@ 16 in ) .

It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beryl late on August 14 with surface winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , based on reconnaissance aircraft observation . Six hours later , the storm accelerated to near 9 mph ( 15 km / h ) , meaning that landfall would happen sooner than expected , preventing the time for Beryl to strengthen to a hurricane . However , Beryl failed to undergo significant intensification as was forecast , as it maintained an intensity of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) .

  "In 1920 , while still attending high school , Cooper took three art courses at Montana Agricultural College in Bozeman . His interest in art was inspired years earlier by the Western paintings of Charles Marion Russell and Frederic Remington . Cooper especially admired and studied Russell 's Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross ' Hole ( 1910 ) , which still hangs in the state capitol building in Helena . In 1922 , Cooper enrolled in Grinnell College in Iowa to continue his art education . Cooper did well academically in most of his courses , but was not accepted to the school 's drama club . His drawings and watercolors were exhibited throughout the dormitory , and he was named art editor for the college yearbook . During the summers of 1922 and 1923 , Cooper worked at Yellowstone National Park as a tour guide driving the yellow open @-@ top buses . Despite a promising first eighteen months at Grinnell , he left college suddenly in February 1924 , spent a month in Chicago looking for work as an artist , and then returned to Helena , where he sold editorial cartoons to the Independent , a local newspaper .",
  "Another cardioid subwoofer array pattern can be used horizontally , one which takes few channels of processing and no change in required physical space . This method is often called \" cardioid subwoofer array \" or \" CSA \" even though the pattern of all directional subwoofer methods is cardioid . The CSA method reverses the enclosure orientation and inverts the polarity of one out of every three subwoofers across the front of the stage , and delays those enclosures for maximum cancellation of the target frequency on stage . Polarity inversion can be implemented electronically , by reversing the wiring polarity , or by physically positioning the enclosure to face rearward . This method reduces forward output relative to a tight @-@ packed , flat @-@ fronted array of subwoofers , but can solve problems of unwanted low frequency energy coming into microphones on stage . Compared to the end @-@ fire array , this method has less on @-@ axis energy but more even pattern control throughout the audience , and more predictable cancellation rearward . The effect spans a range of slightly more than one octave .",

  "True to the then @-@ ideal of Manifest Destiny , over 500 @,@ 000 people set out from the river town of Independence , Missouri to their various destinations in the American West from the 1830s to the 1860s .

For most , the route took them up the Missouri to Omaha , Nebraska , where they would set out along the Platte River , which flows from the Rocky Mountains in Wyoming and Colorado eastwards through the Great Plains . An early expedition led by Robert Stuart from 1812 to 1813 proved the Platte impossible to navigate by the dugout canoes they used , let alone the large sidewheelers and sternwheelers that would later ply the Missouri in increasing numbers . One explorer remarked that the Platte was \" too thick to drink , too thin to plow \" . Nevertheless , the Platte provided an abundant and reliable source of water for the pioneers as they headed west . Covered wagons , popularly referred to as prairie schooners , provided the primary means of transport until the beginning of regular boat service on the river in the 1850s .",

  "For more than a millennium , starting around 754 , the Papal States were territories in Italy under the direct sovereign rule of the Pope . The Catholic Church 's control over Rome and a neighbouring swathe of central Italy was generally seen as a manifestation of the Pope 's secular \" temporal \" power , as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy . After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , the other main Italian states were the Kingdom of Sardinia — governed from Piedmont on the mainland by King Victor Emmanuel II — the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the south , and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in the west . The French occupation during the 1790s had led the Pope 's popularity and spiritual authority to greatly increase , but had also severely damaged the geopolitical credibility of the Papal States .

While Clarissa Treloar remained in Melbourne , their daughter Dawn moved to Canberra and took up a position in the Memorial 's library . Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war . He lived in a cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk .

His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed , however , and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie . While Treloar was a teetotaler and non @-@ smoker , he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie .",

  "Augustine failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia to the west . Gregory had decreed that these Christians should submit to Augustine and that their bishops should obey him , apparently believing that more of the Roman governmental and ecclesiastical organisation survived in Britain than was actually the case . According to the narrative of Bede , the Britons in these regions viewed Augustine with uncertainty , and their suspicion was compounded by a diplomatic misjudgement on Augustine 's part . In 603 , Augustine and Æthelberht summoned the British bishops to a meeting south of the Severn . These guests retired early to confer with their people , who , according to Bede , advised them to judge Augustine based upon the respect he displayed at their next meeting . When Augustine failed to rise from his seat on the entrance of the British bishops , they refused to recognise him as their archbishop . There were , however , deep differences between Augustine and the British church that perhaps played a more significant role in preventing an agreement . At issue were the tonsure , the observance of Easter , and practical and deep @-@ rooted differences in approach to asceticism , missionary endeavours , and how the church itself was organised . Some historians believe that Augustine had no real understanding of the history and traditions of the British church , damaging his relations with their bishops .

  "Damage to the hippocampus does not affect some types of memory , such as the ability to learn new skills ( playing a musical instrument or solving certain types of puzzles , for example ) . This fact suggests that such abilities depend on different types of memory ( procedural memory ) and different brain regions . Furthermore , amnesic patients frequently show \" implicit \" memory for experiences even in the absence of conscious knowledge . For example , patients asked to guess which of two faces they have seen most recently may give the correct answer most of the time in spite of stating that they have never seen either of the faces before . Some researchers distinguish between conscious recollection , which depends on the hippocampus , and familiarity , which depends on portions of the medial temporal cortex .",

Also , the original concept and method had been developed in 1953 by pianist and writer George Russell . Davis saw Russell 's methods of composition as a means of getting away from the dense chord @-@ laden compositions of his time , which Davis had labeled \" thick . \" Modal composition , with its reliance on scales and modes , represented , as Davis called it , \" a return to melody . \" In a 1958 interview with Nat Hentoff of The Jazz Review , Davis elaborated on this form of composition in contrast to the chord progression predominant in bebop , stating \" No chords ... gives you a lot more freedom and space to hear things . When you go this way , you can go on forever . You don 't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [ melody ] line . It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be . When you 're based on chords , you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there 's nothing to do but repeat what you 've just done — with variations . I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords ... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them . \"",

  "Despite the frequent mentioning of the Diolkos in connection with military operations , modern scholarship assumes that the prime purpose of the trackway must have been the transport of cargo , considering that warships cannot have needed transporting very often , and ancient historiography was always more interested in war than commerce . Comments by Pliny the Elder and Strabo , which described the Diolkos as being in regular service during times of peace , also imply a commercial use of the trackway . Coinciding with the rise of monumental architecture in Greece , the construction of the Diolkos may have initially served particularly for transporting heavy goods like marble , monoliths and timber to points west and east . It is not known what tolls Corinth could extract from the Diolkos on its territory , but the fact that the trackway was used and maintained long after its construction indicates that it remained for merchant ships an attractive alternative to the trip around Cape Malea for much of antiquity .",

  "The myth of Actaeon is known to have been narrated in the Catalogue by virtue of a paraphrase found in a fragmentary dictionary of metamorphoses . According to the dictionary , the Catalogue included a variant of the myth in which Actaeon was changed into a stag by Artemis and then killed by his own hounds because he attempted to take Semele as his wife , thus angering Zeus , who had designs upon the woman . Before this testimonium appeared , another papyrus containing 21 hexameters related to the Actaeon myth was published by Edgar Lobel , who tentatively attributed the text to the Catalogue . As the fragment opens , Actaeon has already been torn apart by his dogs , and a goddess — Athena or , less likely , Artemis — arrives at Chiron 's cave . She prophesies to the centaur that Dionysus will be born to Semele and that Actaeon 's dogs will roam the hills with him until his apotheosis , after which they will return to stay with Chiron . At this point the papyrus is damaged , but it is clear that the dogs are delivered from a \" madness \" ( λύσσα , lussa , line 15 ) and begin to mourn their master as the goddess returns to Olympus . Merkelbach and West did not include this papyrus in their edition of the fragment , the latter calling it an \" incoherent epic pastiche \" which would cause the author of the Catalogue to \" turn in his grave if he knew that it had been attributed to him . \" According to Glenn Most , some scholars believe that the text is Hellenistic , but it is demonstrably archaic , and at least a few classicists today consider it to be part of the Catalogue .",

  "One of the chief measures by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by the ordeal of tangena . A poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena ( Tanghinia venenifera ) shrub and ingested , with the outcome determining innocence or guilt . If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal , the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand @-@ ins had already died from the poison 's effects , while among members of the slave class ( andevo ) , the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves . The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin : if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared , but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt . According to 19th @-@ century Malagasy historian Raombana , in the eyes of the greater populace , the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith , even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery .",

  "One of the curiosities of the place is Hautville 's Quoit , which , to save time , should also be looked for on approaching the village . ( Enter iron gate on L. a few hundred yards before reaching tollhouse , and search backwards along the hedge bordering road . ) It is a large stone , which legend says was hurled by Sir J. Hautville ( whose effigy is in Chew Magna Church ) from the top of Maes Knoll . The famous \" druidical remains \" will be found near the church . About 50 yards from the entrance to the churchyard take a lane to the L. leading to an orchard : the stones will be observed in the field beyond ( admission free , but field closed on Sundays ) . The \" remains \" consist of three contiguous circles . The first is of considerable area , and is marked out by twelve large stones , only three of which remain upright ; a smaller circle of eight stones lies just beyond ; and a third circle of eight will be found farther away in an orchard on the R. The two larger circles have each a few scattered stones thrown off as a kind of avenue . Standing apart from the circles is a curious group of three stones huddled together in a garden abutting on the churchyard , from which they can be easily seen by looking over the W. boundary wall . These mystic rings probably had the same origin ( whatever that may have been ) as that of the more famous circle at Avebury in Wiltshire , with which they should be compared . The proximity of Maes Knoll is comparable with that of Silbury Hill . A ridiculous theory suggests that the monoliths were erected as a trophy after one of Arthur 's victories . Arthur is connected to the site because a site in the nearby village of Camerley is reputed to be the location of Camelot in an oral tradition . The stones are of a reddish hue similar to that described in the Arthurian legend as connected to Camelot and to a sword that was seen in a stone near to Camelot .

The episode 's title is a reference to the Jewish mourning prayer service . Gordon was inspired to write the episode based on his heritage . He noted , \" I was always compelled by the Golem mythology . We had never dealt with the horrors of anti @-@ Semitism and the power of the word [ on The X @-@ Files ] . And because I 'm Jewish , it was something that was really compelling to me personally . \" The idea to create a story centering on a Golem , however , had been proposed several times before by \" probably every Jewish writer who 's passed through \" , according to Gordon .",
  "The taxonomy and naming of both M. cerebralis , and of myxozoans in general , have complicated histories . It was originally thought to infect fish brains ( hence the specific epithet cerebralis ) and nervous systems , though it soon was found to primarily infect cartilage and skeletal tissue . Attempts to change the name to Myxobolus chondrophagus , which would more accurately describe the organism , failed because of nomenclature rules . Later , the organisms previously called Triactinomyxon dubium and T. gyrosalmo ( class Actinosporea ) were found to be , in fact , triactinomyxon stages of M. cerebralis , the life cycle of which was expanded to include the triactinomyxon stage . Similarly , other actinosporeans were folded into the life cycles of various myxosporeans .",

  "Externalizing disorders . Externalizing disorders ( i.e. , acting @-@ out disorders ) show a clearer link to delayed gratification , since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control .

In a 2010 study , teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol , or to smoke cigarettes or marijuana . Interestingly , a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ ( in other words , ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ ) .

  "The alpha amino acids are the most common form found in nature , but only when occurring in the L @-@ isomer . The alpha carbon is a chiral carbon atom , with the exception of glycine which has two indistinguishable hydrogen atoms on the alpha carbon . Therefore , all alpha amino acids but glycine can exist in either of two enantiomers , called L or D amino acids , which are mirror images of each other ( see also Chirality ) . While L @-@ amino acids represent all of the amino acids found in proteins during translation in the ribosome , D @-@ amino acids are found in some proteins produced by enzyme posttranslational modifications after translation and translocation to the endoplasmic reticulum , as in exotic sea @-@ dwelling organisms such as cone snails . They are also abundant components of the peptidoglycan cell walls of bacteria , and D @-@ serine may act as a neurotransmitter in the brain . D @-@ amino acids are used in racemic crystallography to create centrosymmetric crystals , which ( depending on the protein ) may allow for easier and more robust protein structure determination . The L and D convention for amino acid configuration refers not to the optical activity of the amino acid itself but rather to the optical activity of the isomer of glyceraldehyde from which that amino acid can , in theory , be synthesized ( D @-@ glyceraldehyde is dextrorotatory ; L @-@ glyceraldehyde is levorotatory ) . In alternative fashion , the ( S ) and ( R ) designators are used to indicate the absolute stereochemistry .

  "At the 500 hPa level , the air temperature averages -7 ° C ( 18 ° F ) within the tropics , but air in the tropics is normally dry at this level , giving the air room to wet @-@ bulb , or cool as it moistens , to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection .

  "The Rokeby Venus was long held to be one of Velázquez 's final works . In 1951 , it was found recorded in an inventory of June 1 , 1651 from the collection of Gaspar Méndez de Haro , 7th Marquis of Carpio , a close associate of Philip IV of Spain . Haro was the great @-@ nephew of Velázquez 's first patron , the Count @-@ Duke of Olivares , and a notorious libertine . According to the art historian Dawson Carr , Haro \" loved paintings almost as much as he loved women \" , and \" even his panegyrists lamented his excessive taste for lower @-@ class women during his youth \" . For these reasons it seemed likely that he would have commissioned the painting . However , in 2001 the art historian Ángel Aterido discovered that the painting had first belonged to the Madrid art dealer and painter Domingo Guerra Coronel , and was sold to Haro in 1652 following Coronel 's death the previous year . Coronel 's ownership of the painting raises a number of questions : how and when it came into Coronel 's possession , and why Velázquez 's name was omitted from Coronel 's inventory . The art critic Javier Portús has suggested that the omission may have been due to the painting 's portrayal of a female nude , \" a type of work which was carefully supervised and whose dissemination was considered problematic \" .",

  "Areoles are highly specialized and very condensed shoots or branches . In a normal shoot , nodes bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem ( internodes ) . In an areole , the nodes are so close together , they form a single structure .

  "The case first went to the High Court of Justice , where it was heard by Fulford J ; he decided that he did not have the authority to overrule Bonnard , and passed the case on to the Court of Appeal after granting a temporary injunction . In the Court of Appeal , the case was heard by May , Dyson and Brooke LJJ , with Brooke delivering the judgment on 5 November 2004 . In it , Brooke judged that defamation , the subject of Greene , was significantly different from breach of confidentiality , the subject in Cream . While the damage from a breach of confidentiality can never be undone , justifiying a simple test for issuing injunctions , a defamation case that is won vindicates the injured party . Making it easier to grant injunctions in defamation cases would damage the delicate balance between freedom of the press and the right to privacy ; as such , despite the Human Rights Act , Bonnard is still a valid test .",

  "Opinion over Mansfield 's intention in his ruling in Somerset 's Case is mixed , with the current prevailing view being that he did not intend to free the slaves . The judgment was particularly narrow , as it ruled only that a master could not carry his slave out of England by force , not that slaves who came to England were emancipated . This is seen as particularly telling because this was the primary argument of Davy and Hargrave . If Murray had wanted to emancipate the slaves completely , there were various bits of judicial precedent he could have based his decision on , such as Smith v Gould or Shanley v Harvey , but he did not . Various comments he made before and during the case also suggest that complete emancipation was not his intent ; in a preliminary judgment he said that \" the setting 14 @,@ 000 or 15 @,@ 000 men at once free loose by a solemn opinion , is much disagreeable in the effect it threatens ” , which one modern legal scholar interprets as indicative of his reluctance to make a decision for fear of economic consequences .

  "In 1900 , the German physicist Max Planck was studying black @-@ body radiation and suggested that the energy carried by electromagnetic waves could only be released in \" packets \" of energy . In his 1901 article in Annalen der Physik he called these packets \" energy elements \" .

In 1905 , Albert Einstein suggested that electromagnetic waves could only exist as discrete wave @-@ packets . He called such a wave @-@ packet the light quantum ( German : das Lichtquant ) . The name photon derives from the Greek word for light , φῶς ( transliterated phôs ) . Arthur Compton used photon in 1928 , referring to Gilbert N. Lewis . The same name was used earlier , by the American physicist and psychologist Leonard T.

The name was suggested initially as a unit related to the illumination of the eye and the resulting sensation of light and was used later in a physiological context . Although Wolfers 's and Lewis 's theories were contradicted by many experiments and never accepted , the new name was adopted very soon by most physicists after Compton used it .",

Crossing over to Persian territory , over the next few years Artabanes and those who followed him took part in Khosrau 's campaigns against the Byzantines .",

  "The role of the gyroscopic effect in most bike designs is to help steer the front wheel into the direction of a lean . This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin . The slower a front wheel spins , the faster it will precess when the bike leans , and vice versa . The rear wheel is prevented from precessing as the front wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground , and so continues to lean as though it were not spinning at all . Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping .",

It is , observed Neville , an irony that the overheated melodrama that Gibbons most disliked was at the heart of her one great success ; Gibbons 's writings on everyday life brought her restrained approval , but no noticeable literary recognition . Nevertheless , her straightforward , style , unadorned except in parody , is admired by Rachel Cooke , who praises her as \" a sworn enemy of the flatulent , the pompous and the excessively sentimental . \" While short of sentimentality , Gibbons 's writing , in prose or verse , did not lack sensitivity . She had what one analyst described as \" a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable \" . Some of Gibbons 's poetry expressed her love of nature and a prophetic awareness for environmental issues such as sea pollution , decades before such concerns became fashionable . In a critical summary of Gibbons 's poems , Loralee MacPike has described them as \" slight lyrics ... [ which ] tend toward classic , even archaic , diction , and only occasionally ... show flashes of the novels ' wit \" .",

Gelatinous planktonic animals are between 50 and 90 percent transparent . A transparency of 50 percent is enough to make an animal invisible to a predator such as cod at a depth of 650 metres ( 2 @,@ 130 ft ) ; better transparency is required for invisibility in shallower water , where the light is brighter and predators can see better . For example , a cod can see prey that are 98 percent transparent in optimal lighting in shallow water . Therefore , sufficient transparency for camouflage is more easily achieved in deeper waters .",

  "Debate on church officers began on 19 October . The Assembly began with the issue of ordination , as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church . While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers ( though they should not administer the sacraments without it ) , a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination . There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church . The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation , while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a disintegrated English church . Despite these debates , up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved .",

  "Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic felt that the reworking of Madonna 's older hits like \" Into the Groove \" and \" Holiday \" gave them a campy , Eurotrash feel like the songs on Confessions on a Dance Floor ; he added that \" [ the reworkings ] help give the disc a cohesive feel even if the live performance , like the album it 's hawking , is kind of humorless . That said , as Madonna 's first live CD , I 'm Going to Tell You a Secret is strong and entertaining , and even if the excessive minutiae on the accompanying DVD means only hardcore fans will sit through its two hours , it 's also quite well done . \" Sterdan from Jam ! complimented the CD section of the release , saying that \" Thankfully , the CD takes up the slack , delivering more than an hour of newer fare like ' American Life ' and ' Music ' , peppered with oldies like ' Vogue ' , ' Holiday ' and ' Like a Prayer ' . Next time Madonna wants to share a secret , she should just leave the cameras at home . \" Conversely , Sébastien Chicoine from Canoe.ca website preferred the DVD over the CD , saying that the disc was not \" absolutely necessary \" but could understand the business logic behind adding the CD to the release .",
  "At 5 : 12 am on April 18 , 1906 , a major earthquake struck San Francisco and northern California . As buildings collapsed from the shaking , ruptured gas lines ignited fires that spread across the city and burned out of control for several days . With water mains out of service , the Presidio Artillery Corps attempted to contain the inferno by dynamiting blocks of buildings to create firebreaks . More than three @-@ quarters of the city lay in ruins , including almost all of the downtown core . Contemporary accounts reported that 498 people lost their lives , though modern estimates put the number in the several thousands . More than half of the city 's population of 400 @,@ 000 was left homeless . Refugees settled temporarily in makeshift tent villages in Golden Gate Park , the Presidio , on the beaches , and elsewhere . Many fled permanently to the East Bay .",
  "According to recent studies , like the Milky Way , the Andromeda Galaxy lies in what in the galaxy color – magnitude diagram is known as the green valley , a region populated by galaxies in transition from the blue cloud ( galaxies actively forming new stars ) to the red sequence ( galaxies that lack star formation ) . Star formation activity in green valley galaxies is slowing as they run out of star @-@ forming gas in the interstellar medium . In simulated galaxies with similar properties , star formation will typically have been extinguished within about five billion years from now , even accounting for the expected , short @-@ term increase in the rate of star formation due to the collision between Andromeda and the Milky Way .",

  "Tyutcheva was eventually fired . She took her story to other members of the family . While Rasputin 's visits to the children were , by all accounts , completely innocent in nature , the family was scandalized . Tyutcheva told Nicholas 's sister , Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia , that Rasputin visited the girls , talked with them while they were getting ready for bed , and hugged and patted them . Tyutcheva said the children had been taught not to discuss Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff . Xenia wrote on March 15 , 1910 that she couldn 't understand \" ... the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory ( whom they consider to be almost a saint , when in fact he 's only a khlyst ! ) \"",
  "The latest definite sighting of dodos , on Amber Island in 1662 , may not necessarily have been the last members of the species . The last claimed sighting of a dodo was reported in the hunting records of Isaac Johannes Lamotius in 1688 . Statistical analysis of these records by Roberts and Solow gives a new estimated extinction date of 1693 , with a 95 % confidence interval of 1688 – 1715 . The authors also pointed out that because the last sighting before 1662 was in 1638 , the dodo was probably already quite rare by the 1660s , and thus a disputed report from 1674 by an escaped slave cannot be dismissed out of hand .",

  "Müller has been praised for his maturity , pace , technique , awareness and positioning . He has been particularly noted for his composure ; Germany manager Joachim Löw said he is \" impervious to pressure \" and former Bayern manager Louis van Gaal said he has tremendous mental strength . A consistent scorer and creator of goals , he describes himself as a player who can find gaps in the opposition defence but not particularly good at dribbling or one @-@ on @-@ ones . Müller describes this role as Raumdeuter , a term that translates to \" interpreter of space \" ( cf . Traumdeuter , \" dream interpreter \" ) . During 2014 World Cup , Germany manager Joachim Löw stated that Müller \" is a very unorthodox player and you can 't really predict his lines of running , but he has one aim and that is ' how can I score a goal ? \" .",
  "The European Court of Auditors , despite its name , has no judicial powers . It ensures that taxpayer funds from the budget of the European Union have been correctly spent .

  "While waiting for their legal appeals to be heard , the CPUSA leaders became convinced that the government would undertake the prosecution of many additional Party officers . To ensure continuity of their leadership , they decided that four of the defendants should go into hiding and lead the CPUSA from outside prison . The defendants were ordered to report to prison on July 2 , 1951 , after the Supreme Court upheld their convictions and their legal appeals were exhausted . When July arrived , only seven defendants reported to prison , and four ( Winston , Green , Thompson , and Hall ) went into hiding , forfeiting $ 80 @,@ 000 bail ( $ 795 @,@ 636 in 2016 dollars ) . Hall was captured in Mexico in 1951 , trying to flee to the Soviet Union . Thompson was captured in California in 1952 . Both had three years added to their five @-@ year sentences . Winston and Green surrendered voluntarily in 1956 after they felt that anti @-@ communist hysteria had diminished . Some of the defendants did not fare well in prison : Thompson was attacked by an anti @-@ communist inmate ; Winston became blind because a brain tumor was not treated promptly ; Gates was put into solitary confinement because he refused to lock the cells of fellow inmates ; and Davis was ordered to mop floors because he protested against racial segregation in prison ."
