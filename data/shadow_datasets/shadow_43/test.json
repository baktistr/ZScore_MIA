  "Washbrook had been criticised after the First Test for playing aggressively and taking too many risks early in his innings , having fallen twice to attacking shots . He continued to play in a similar way , rather than adopting the traditional opener 's strategy of not playing at any ball unless it was going to hit the stumps and waiting for the bowlers to tire . Lindwall had Washbrook caught behind for eight in his fourth over , playing at a ball outside off stump , and ended his pre @-@ lunch spell with 1 / 7 from six overs , while Johnston accompanied him from the other end . Neither Hutton nor Washbrook appeared comfortable against the bowling , and the new batsman Edrich tried to hit Lindwall through the off side , leading to a loud appeal for caught behind , which was turned down . After lunch , Hutton did the majority of the scoring , before playing outside a Johnson off break on the front foot and being bowled for 20 to leave England at 32 / 2 . The English opener had been uncertain against Johnson 's spin and played forward too early at a slower ball , which went between a gap between his bat and pad . Compton came in , having been dismissed hit wicket after falling over in the last Test while trying to avoid a bouncer , and Lindwall delivered a few short balls straight away , but the new batsman was not caught off @-@ guard . Lindwall then clean bowled Edrich — who was playing across the line — with an outswinger for five . Edrich had toiled for 70 minutes in scoring those runs . Dollery came out and played the first ball with his pads before being bowled for a duck from the next delivery . Dollery 's bat was still about to start its downward swing towards by the time Lindwall 's outswinger had passed him and hit the stumps . O 'Reilly said Dollery 's inability to deal with Lindwall was typical of English cricket 's lack of answers to express pace bowling . This was part of a six @-@ over post @-@ lunch spell by Lindwall that yielded 2 / 11 as the batsmen appeared unable to deal with his extreme pace .

The Miranda warning concerns the duty of the police or other formal questioners to make sure that the suspect is aware they have that right prior to questioning , in case they want to be silent at some point or the suspect later pleads ignorance that they had the right ( and would have relied upon it had they been aware ) .

  "It seems relatively certain that the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the battle . Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall , planning to catch the Allies as they fled . However , modern historians have greatly debated this point , with some pointing out the difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night , and others accepting Herodotus 's version . There are thus two possibilities ; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to the Straits , and then entered the straits in daylight ; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night . Regardless of when they attempted it , it seems likely that the Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari , so that from an initial east @-@ west alignment ( blocking the exit ) , they came round to a north @-@ south alignment ( see diagram ) . The Persian fleet seems to have been formed into three ranks of ships ( according to Aeschylus ) ; with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo , the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre .",

The President 's team is then subject to hearings at the European Parliament which will question them and then vote on their suitability as a whole . If members of the team are found to be too inappropriate , the President must then reshuffle the team or request a new candidate from the member state or risk the whole Commission being voted down .

If you were to ask who were the best three screenwriters in the business , Steve Zaillian would be one of them . We discussed Hannibal endlessly . \" Asked if he had read Mamet 's draft , he said : \" Yes . He is very fast , very efficient , but he was off doing a film .

  "Although Wollstonecraft argues against excessive sensibility , the rhetoric of the Rights of Woman is at times heated and attempts to provoke the reader . Many of the most emotional comments in the book are directed at Rousseau . For example , after excerpting a long passage from Emile ( 1762 ) , Wollstonecraft pithily states , \" I shall make no other comments on this ingenious passage , than just to observe , that it is the philosophy of lasciviousness . \" A mere page later , after indicting Rousseau 's plan for female education , she writes \" I must relieve myself by drawing another picture . \" These terse exclamations are meant to draw the reader to her side of the argument ( it is assumed that the reader will agree with them ) . While she claims to write in a plain style so that her ideas will reach the broadest possible audience , she actually combines the plain , rational language of the political treatise with the poetic , passionate language of sensibility to demonstrate that one can combine rationality and sensibility in the same self . Wollstonecraft defends her positions not only with reasoned argument but also with ardent rhetoric .",

A 2013 review showed a slight correlation between groundwater and soil PFAA levels and human activity ; there was no clear pattern of one chemical dominating , and higher amounts of PFOS were correlated to higher amounts of PFOA . In the body , PFAAs bind to proteins such as serum albumin ; they tend to concentrate within humans in the liver and blood before excretion through the kidneys . Dwell time in the body varies greatly by species , with half @-@ lives of days in rodents , and years in humans . High doses of PFOS and PFOA cause cancer and death in newborn rodents but human studies have not established an effect at current exposure levels .",

The incomplete specimen numbered UCCIPR L @-@ 18 F @-@ 974 , is currently preserved in the paleontology collections housed at the Thompson Rivers University , Kamloops , British Columbia . Archibald , Cover , and Moreau coined the specific epithet \" herculeanus \" from the Latin name \" Hercules \" in reference to the notably sturdy and large morphology of the type specimen , and after the divine hero Heracles in Greek mythology , who was the son of Zeus and Alcmene . The species is discernible from the other species of Myrmeciinae by its notably larger size , the worker caste ant is estimated at over 20 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) in life . Its size is comparable to ants in the genus Ypresiomyrma . The shape of the petiole , a narrow waist that is located between the mesosoma and gaster is distinct from other species and is similar in structure to the genus Prionomyrmex though the shape and size of the mandibles are distinct . Overall , M. herculeanus was assigned to Myrmeciinae due to its mandible length , despite them being poorly preserved , and due to the appearance of its petiole and propodeum . The legs are long in comparison to its body length , and the gaster is robust . It is unknown if the species had a sting , due to the preservation of the specimen . The size of the single known worker is larger than any of the studied queens ; as Myrmeciinae queens are slightly larger than the other castes in a species , this indicates M. herculeanus is most likely a distinct species . Due to the incomplete nature of the type specimen , the species was placed in Myrmeciites .",

Its tongue — long , slender , sharp , and frayed — may have been able to move rapidly , helpful when feeding on fruit , nectar , pollen , and invertebrates . Its pelvic elements were robust and its feet and claws large , indicating that it foraged near the ground . Its jaws were strong ; Morioka compared its skull to that of the hoopoe , and it may have foraged in a similar way , probing and opening holes in substrate by inserting and opening its beak . De Montbeillard was informed of the stomach contents of a dissected specimen , consisting of seeds and the berries of \" Pseudobuxus \" ( possibly Eugenia buxifolia , a bush with sweet , orange berries ) . He noted that the bird weighed 4 ounces ( 110 g ) , and was fatter around June and July . Several accounts suggest that the hoopoe starling migrated on Réunion , spending six months in the lowlands and six months in the mountains . Food may have been easier to obtain in the lowlands during winter , with the birds breeding in the mountain forests during summer . The hoopoe starling probably nested in tree cavities . Its song was described as a \" bright and cheerful whistle \" and \" clear notes \" , indicating a similarity to the songs of other starlings .",

They usurped the prerogative of senior officer promotion and appointed generals based on loyalty to the palace , giving orders directly to officers . This action caused deep distrust among the senior officers and fragmented their power . Krulak failed to realize that if the situation deteriorated to the point where discontent with Diệm posed the possibility of a communist victory , the generals would intervene in politics because of what would happen to them under communist rule .

  "The Age of Reason ; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology is an influential work written by English and American political activist Thomas Paine . It follows in the tradition of eighteenth @-@ century British deism , and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the Bible .

Paine advocates reason in the place of revelation , leading him to reject miracles and to view the Bible as \" an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text \" . It promotes natural religion and argues for the existence of a creator @-@ God .",

  "After a time , Himmler found that the killing methods used by the Einsatzgruppen were inefficient : they were costly , demoralising for the troops , and sometimes did not kill the victims quickly enough . Many of the troops found the massacres to be difficult if not impossible to perform . Some of the perpetrators suffered physical and mental health problems , and many turned to drink . As much as possible , the Einsatzgruppen leaders militarized the genocide . The historian Christian Ingrao notes an attempt was made to make the shootings a collective act without individual responsibility . Framing the shootings in this way was not psychologically sufficient for every perpetrator to feel absolved of guilt . Browning notes three categories of potential perpetrators : those who were eager to participate right from the start , those who participated in spite of moral qualms because they were ordered to do so , and a significant minority who refused to take part . A few men spontaneously became excessively brutal in their killing methods and their zeal for the task .

If the damage is early in the plants life , then damage will mostly be to the leaves . Plants compensate for the damage by processes such as increasing seed size in remaining pods . Most damage happens in August , when the plants are flowering . Attacks that happen after August do much less damage because many pods have developed tougher walls that H. zea can 't penetrate .

  "In December , the deputies of the other provinces convened by the circular of May 27 arrived to Buenos Aires . Most of them were closer to the ideas of Saavedra , and Gregorio Funes became highly influential over them . They did not agree about which body they should join : the deputies wanted to join the Junta , while Moreno thought that they should start a constituent assembly . Funes , allied with Saavedra , calculated that they could stop Moreno by joining the Junta , as his proposals would be agreed to by a minority . The Junta , with both its original members and the deputies , discussed the topic on December 18 . Funes said that Buenos Aires had no right to rule the other provinces without their consent , and got the support of the other members . He said that there was popular discontent with the Junta . The supporters of Moreno said that such discontent was only among some rebels , and Moreno said that it was only the discontent of the Patricians in respect of the Supressions decree . However , only Paso voted with him , and the deputies joined the Junta . Moreno resigned , but his resignation was rejected . His opposition to the incorporation of the deputies is seen by some historians as an initial step in the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces , which dominated politics in Argentina during the following decades . Some call it a precursor of the Unitarian Party , while others find his words or actions more consistent with the Federal Party . However , historians Paul Groussac and Norberto Piñeiro feel it is inappropriate to extrapolate so far into the future .

  "Red Dead Redemption primarily takes place in 1911 . The team chose this time period as they felt that exploring the transformation from \" the old West \" into the modern world was intriguing . Taking inspiration from The Wild Bunch ( 1969 ) , High Plains Drifter ( 1973 ) Unforgiven ( 1992 ) and The Proposition ( 2005 ) , the team felt that most Western fiction takes place between 1840 and 1880 . Game designer and writer Christian Cantamessa explained that the \" overarching theme is the ' Death of the West ' rather than the more conventional ' Myth of the West ' that is often seen in the classic John Wayne films \" . The team felt that \" a classic ' we are conquering this wilderness ' story \" was not very interesting in itself , but adding the transformation of the world during the game 's time period sparked their interest . The allusions to politics throughout the narrative are supposed to represent the darker undertones surrounding the foundations of the American Dream . In addition , the game itself exhibits qualities relating to the movement from a \" violent freedom \" to a situation of \" overt state control \" , told through a story of innocence and freedom . Vice President for Creativity Dan Houser made parallels with this representation , and the more recent predicament of the modern society of America . Houser also expressed the difficulty in balancing the game 's narrative to avoid feeling both \" camp \" and \" pompous \" ; he explained that balancing the two while maintaining realism was where the difficulty spawned . With the story , Houser felt that it does not fully represent the racial attitudes commonly associated with the game 's era . He stated that this was a choice made by the designers due to the unpleasantness of the attitudes . \" [ T ] he language people use to describe other races is insanely offensive to modern ears and we hint at that but we maybe don 't do it with quite the vibrancy that people use in some of our research , \" he explained . The team focused more on the combination of old and modern America , and the change that was experienced during this period . In terms of the violence depicted throughout the game , Houser spoke about the team 's need for it to feel \" slightly raw and unpleasant \" ; they tried to achieve realism without exaggerating . The team were hoping for players to display an \" emotional response \" from the game , and for them to feel immersed in the game world and time period .",

  "The Narragansett Pacer played a significant role in the creation of the American Saddlebred , the Standardbred and the Tennessee Walking Horse . The breed was also combined with French pacers to create the Canadian Pacer , a breed especially suited to racing over ice and which also contributed substantially to the creation of the Standardbred . In the early 19th century , Pacer mares were bred to stallions of the fledgling Morgan breed . However , the Morgan breed was selected for a trot as an intermediate gait , and thus ambling horses were frowned upon , so most Narragansett / Morgan crosses were sold to Canada , the Caribbean , and South America , so the bloodlines did not remain within the Morgan breed . Other breeds indirectly influenced by the Narragansett Pacer include the Rocky Mountain Horse , a gaited breed started in Kentucky , and the Tiger Horse , a gaited breed with Appaloosa patterning .",

  "Group 12 metals are chalcophiles , meaning the elements have low affinities for oxides and prefer to bond with sulfides .

No significant deposits of cadmium @-@ containing ores are known . Greenockite ( CdS ) , the only cadmium mineral of importance , is nearly always associated with sphalerite ( ZnS ) .

One place where metallic cadmium can be found is the Vilyuy River basin in Siberia .

  "The aquatic lifestyle of cetaceans first began in the Indian subcontinent from even @-@ toed ungulates 50 million years ago , over a period of at least 15 million years , however a jawbone discovered in Antarctica may reduce this to 5 million years . Archaeoceti is an extinct parvorder of Cetacea containing ancient whales . The traditional theory of cetacean evolution , first proposed by Van Valen in 1966 , was that whales were related to the mesonychids , an extinct order of carnivorous ungulates ( hoofed animals ) that resembled wolves with hooves and were a sister group of the artiodactyls ( even @-@ toed ungulates ) . This theory arose due to similarities between the unusual triangular teeth of the mesonychids and those of early whales . However , molecular phylogeny data indicates that whales are very closely related to the artiodactyls , with hippopotamuses as their closest living relative . Because of this , cetaceans and hippopotamuses are placed in the same suborder , Whippomorpha . Cetartiodactyla ( formed from the words Cetacea and Artiodactyla ) is a proposed name for an order containing both cetaceans and artiodactyls . However , the earliest anthracotheres , the ancestors of hippos , do not appear in the fossil record until the Middle Eocene , millions of years after Pakicetus , the first known whale ancestor , appeared during the Early Eocene , implying the two groups diverged well before the Eocene . Since molecular analysis identifies artiodactyls as being very closely related to cetaceans , mesonychids are probably an offshoot from Artiodactyla , and cetaceans did not derive directly from them .",

Within one ministry there could be great variation in pay rates for jobs requiring largely identical responsibilities and skills , based on what the factory was producing , the location of the factory and other factors that Moscow considered important . Basing payments on these central directives often led to long and costly processes in the calculation of wages . Historian Donald Filtzer wrote of one 1930s machinist who in one month completed 1 @,@ 424 individual pieces of work . Amongst these had been 484 differing tasks , all of which had been assigned a basic individual payment rate of between 3 and 50 kopeks each ( 1 ruble was equal to 100 kopeks ) . To calculate this worker 's wage , his employer had to process 2 @,@ 885 documents which had required some 8 @,@ 500 signatures on 8 kilograms of paper , costing the factory 309 rubles , a fifth of what they would pay the worker , whose total earnings for the labour amounted to 1 @,@ 389 rubles .",

  "Written in 1969 and later published in the Houseworker 's Handbook Betsy Warrior presents a cogent argument that the production and reproduction of domestic labor performed by women constitutes the foundation of all economic transactions and survival ; although , unremunerated and not included in the GDP . According to Warrior : \" Economics , as it 's presented today , lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out the very foundation of economic life . That foundation is built on women 's labor ; first her reproductive labor which produces every new laborer ( and the first commodity , which is mother 's milk and which sustains every new consumer / laborer ) ; secondly , women 's labor entails environmentally necessary cleaning , cooking to make raw materials consumable , negotiating to maintain social stability and nurturing , which prepares for market and maintains each laborer . This constitutes women 's continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in the work force . Without this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity nor we would have survived to continue to evolve . \" Warrior also notes that the unacknowledged income of men from illegal activities like arms , drugs and human trafficking , political graft , religious emoluments and various other undisclosed activities provide a rich revenue stream to men , which further invalidates GDP figures . Even in underground economies where women predominate numerically , like trafficking in humans , prostitution and domestic servitude , only a tiny fraction of the pimp 's revenue filters down to the women and children he deploys . Usually the amount spent on them is merely for the maintenance of their lives and , in the case of those prostituted , some money may be spent on clothing and such accouterments as will make them more salable to the pimp 's clients . For instance , focusing on just the U.S.A. , according to a government sponsored report by the Urban Institute in 2014 , \" A street prostitute in Dallas may make as little as $ 5 per sex act . But pimps can take in $ 33 @,@ 000 a week in Atlanta , where the sex business brings in an estimated $ 290 million per year . \" Warrior believes that only an inclusive , facts @-@ based economic analysis will provide a reliable bases for future planning for environmental and reproductive / population needs .",

  "In addition to being a major source of variation , mutation may also function as a mechanism of evolution when there are different probabilities at the molecular level for different mutations to occur , a process known as mutation bias . If two genotypes , for example one with the nucleotide G and another with the nucleotide A in the same position , have the same fitness , but mutation from G to A happens more often than mutation from A to G , then genotypes with A will tend to evolve . Different insertion vs. deletion mutation biases in different taxa can lead to the evolution of different genome sizes .

For example , according to the phenotype @-@ first theory of evolution , mutations can eventually cause the genetic assimilation of traits that were previously induced by the environment .",

The game board was attached to the top of the box and a drawer was added to the box for the implements and spinner . A teetotum was no longer needed as a metal pointer could be attached to a lithographed card using a pop rivet . The pointer could then spin around to produce a random number . The game board and box top were printed using lithography , making the game look like a work of art . Some of the vice spaces were removed ( those depicting women engaged in immoral acts and behaviors ) , and men were substituted for women in the House of Correction . The game remained in the Parker Brothers catalog for thirty years , displaying the line , \" The first board game ever published in America \" on its box cover .",

  "It has been debated by biographers and band historians just how involved Clark was in the recording of The Notorious Byrd Brothers . Clark himself claimed during a 1988 interview for radio station KBSG 97 that he was involved in the recording of \" Goin ' Back \" and some other songs from the same period , although he didn 't specify what his contributions might have been . There is also studio documentation and eyewitness accounts to suggest that Clark contributed backing vocals to \" Goin ' Back \" and \" Space Odyssey \" . One of those eyewitnesses , John Noreen of the L.A. folk rock band The Rose Garden , has stated in an interview that he clearly remembers being at Columbia Recording Studios during sessions for the album and seeing Clark record his backing vocals . This has been corroborated by The Rose Garden 's drummer , Bruce Bowdin , who has claimed that Clark 's voice can be heard most clearly on the mono mix of \" Goin ' Back \" that was released as a single . However , if Clark is present on either \" Space Odyssey \" or \" Goin ' Back \" , his contributions are not obvious and must have been buried very low in the mix by producer Gary Usher .

Isopods vary in size , ranging from some Microcerberidae species of just 0 @.@ 3 mm to the deep sea Bathynomus spp. of nearly 50 cm ( 20 in ) . Isopods lack an obvious carapace ( shell ) , which is reduced to a \" cephalic shield \" covering only the head .

  "According to lead vocalist Bart Millard , MercyMe had started as a rock band and had wanted to make a rock record . Following the success of their breakthrough single \" I Can Only Imagine \" , a ballad , they were advised to \" duplicate [ ' I Can Only Imagine ' ] on the next two records \" . Millard says they felt that they were at a point where \" we are known more for ballads than the rock band we wanted to be \" . With the consent of their label , which felt there was a trend towards heavier music , MercyMe decided to make an \" edgier \" record . In particular the band focused on up @-@ tempo songs , trying to put more edge into what they were making . Millard noted that while the songs are still pop rock songs , the band tried to put a bit more edge into them . Additionally , the band decided to work with producer Brown Bannister , who had produced the group 's Christmas record and Millard 's solo album Hymned No. 1 , as opposed to Pete Kipley , who had produced the band 's previous three albums . Bannister 's producing style was different from Kipley 's ; while Kipley was a hands @-@ on producer , \" involved in every part of the song \" , Bannister would wait until the band had \" run down all [ their ] avenues \" before giving input . The band felt Bannsiter was an \" amazing encourager \" and were satisfied with the Christmas album Bannister had produced with him ; although they felt Kipley did a great job on their previous records , improving themselves as a band and as songwriters , they felt it was \" time for a change \" . Another factor in the decision to use Bannister was his previous recording experience ; Bannister had produced one of Millard 's favorite albums , White Heart 's 1989 album Freedom . The different approach the band took with Bannister resulted in a sometimes \" radical \" approach , with the band \" taking songs apart , putting them back together and , at times , totally reinventing them \" . One song , \" Something About You \" , shifted from \" an aggressive rock song to a soaring anthem \" .",

A series of disputes between the Royalist commanders allowed Taunton some respite at the start of the siege , but in May the attacks were fierce under the command of Sir Ralph Hopton . After five days of intense fighting , which had once again driven the defending army back to a small central perimeter including the castle , the Royalists retreated in the face of a Parliamentarian relief army commanded by Ralph Weldon .",

  "Todd McCarthy of Variety felt that the film 's premise was undermined by the execution . McCarthy believed the concept ensured the film was \" amusing and plausible \" for its first half , but that the second half was full of illogical story developments and missed opportunities . Stephen Farber of The Hollywood Reporter said that the opening established the premise well , but that the film came undone when it began to alternate between comedy and tragedy , and introduced a backstory for Hancock that did not make sense . He said it rewrote its own internal logic in order to pander to its audience . Stephen Hunter in The Washington Post said it had begun with promise , but that the change in tone partway through was so abrupt that the film did not recover . Jim Schembri of The Age called the change in direction \" an absolute killer story twist \" , and David Denby of The New Yorker said it lifted the film to a new level by supplementing the jokes with sexual tension and emotional power .",

Riel was easily swayed to support their cause — which was perhaps not surprising in view of Riel 's continuing conviction that he was the divinely selected leader of the Métis and the prophet of a new form of Christianity . Riel also intended to use the new position of influence to pursue his own land claims in Manitoba . The party departed 4 June , and arrived back at Batoche on 5 July . Upon his arrival Métis and English settlers alike formed an initially favourable impression of Riel following a series of speeches in which he advocated moderation and a reasoned approach . During June 1884 , the Plains Cree leaders Big Bear and Poundmaker were independently formulating their complaints , and subsequently held meetings with Riel . However , the Native grievances were quite different from those of the settlers , and nothing was then resolved .

A joint English @-@ Métis central committee with Jackson acting as secretary worked to reconcile proposals from different communities . In the interim , Riel 's support began to waver .

Only Hoyt Wilhelm , Rollie Fingers , Dennis Eckersley , Goose Gossage , and Bruce Sutter have been inducted into the Hall of Fame @-@ based primarily on their relief pitching , and only Sutter has been inducted with fewer innings or starting appearances than Smith . In addition , Fingers and Eckersley – the only two to be elected in fewer than eight tries – won MVP awards , and Sutter captured a Cy Young Award , but Smith was rarely a serious contender for either trophy .

  "The rich and complex mythology associated with this image includes episodes that parallel other stories about the Buddha ... The rituals and myths of Mahamuni thus accomplish two aims simultaneously : they place local contexts and actors within a universal Buddhist cosmology , and they locate a continuing biography of the Buddha in the Buddhist politics of Arakan and Upper Burma . Theravada politics characteristically extended the biographical mode of recreating the Buddha 's presence and associated with it the power of kings and other patrons of this image . The veneration of this Buddha image is thus informed by local conceptions of religious patronage in sociopolitical domains .",

  "This was in contrast to the Bolsheviks , who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void . Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks , alienated from the Western powers , than with a restored Russian Empire .

  "President Tyler dedicated his last two years in office to the annexation of Texas . He initially sought election to a full term , but after failing to gain the support of either Whigs or Democrats , he withdrew .

  "Before meeting with Madonna , McDaniel first listened to the song and found it inspiring . When asked by the singer about her references for the video , McDaniel presented her with pictures from her favorite 1970s photographer , Bill Burke , who took pictures of people considered as freaks or inbred . Another reference was the photography book , East 100 Street by Bruce Davidson , which showed pictures of people in Spanish Harlem .

  "The sail of Dimetrodon is formed by elongated neural spines projecting from the vertebrae . Each spine varies in cross @-@ sectional shape from its base to its tip in what is known as \" dimetrodont \" differentiation . Near the vertebra body , the spine cross section is laterally compressed into a rectangular shape , and closer to the tip , it takes on a figure @-@ eight shape as a groove runs along either side of the spine . The figure @-@ eight shape is thought to reinforce the spine , preventing bending and fractures . A cross section of the spine of one specimen of Dimetrodon giganhomogenes is rectangular in shape but preserves figure @-@ eight shaped rings close to its center , indicating that the shape of spines may change as individuals age . The microscopic anatomy of each spine varies from base to tip , indicating where it was embedded in the muscles of the back and where it was exposed as part of a sail . The lower or proximal portion of the spine has a rough surface that would have served as an anchoring point for the epaxial muscles of the back , and also has a network of connective tissues called Sharpey 's fibers that indicate it was embedded within the body . Higher up on the distal ( outer ) portion of the spine , the bone surface is smoother . The periosteum , a layer of tissue surrounding the bone , is covered in small grooves that presumably supported the blood vessels that vascularized the sail . The large groove that runs the length of the spine was once thought to be a channel for blood vessels , but since the bone does not contain vascular canals , the sail is not thought to have been as highly vascularized as once thought . Some specimens of Dimetrodon preserve deformed areas of the neural spines that appear to be healed @-@ over fractures . The cortical bone that grew over these breaks is highly vascularized , suggesting that soft tissue must have been present on the sail to supply the site with blood vessels . Layered lamellar bone makes up most of the neural spine 's cross @-@ sectional area , and contains lines of arrested growth that can be used to determine the age of each individual at death . In many specimens of D. gigashomogenes the distal portions of spines bend sharply , indicating that the sail would have had an irregular profile in life . Their crookedness suggests that soft tissue may not have extended all the way to the tips of the spines , meaning that the sail 's webbing may not have been as extensive as it is commonly imagined .",

Queen Anne had created 12 Tory peers to vote through the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 . The Reform Act 1832 was passed when the House of Lords dropped opposition — William IV had threatened to create 80 new peers by request of the Prime Minister , Earl Grey — creating an informal convention that the Lords would give way when the public was behind the House of Commons . For example , Irish Disestablishment , which had been a major bone of contention between the two main parties since the 1830s , was — following intervention by the Queen — passed by the Lords in 1869 after W.E.

  "Andersson et al . ( 1998 ) provide a randomized algorithm called signature sort that allows for linear time sorting of sets of up to 2O ( ( log w ) 1 / 2 − ε ) items at a time , for any constant ε > 0 . As in the algorithm of Kirkpatrick and Reisch , they perform range reduction using a representation of the keys as numbers in base b for a careful choice of b . Their range reduction algorithm replaces each digit by a signature , which is a hashed value with O ( log n ) bits such that different digit values have different signatures . If n is sufficiently small , the numbers formed by this replacement process will be significantly smaller than the original keys , allowing the non @-@ conservative packed sorting algorithm of Albers & Hagerup ( 1997 ) to sort the replaced numbers in linear time . From the sorted list of replaced numbers , it is possible to form a compressed trie of the keys in linear time , and the children of each node in the trie may be sorted recursively using only keys of size b , after which a tree traversal produces the sorted order of the items .",

  "In 287 BC , the Plebeians seceded to the Janiculum hill . To end the secession , a law ( the \" Hortensian Law \" ) was passed , which ended the requirement that the Patrician senators consent before a bill could be brought before the Plebeian Council for a vote . The ultimate significance of this law was in the fact that it robbed the Patricians of their final weapon over the Plebeians . The result was that the ultimate control over the state fell , not onto the shoulders of democracy , but onto the shoulders of the new Patricio @-@ Plebeian aristocracy . By the middle of the second century BC , the economic situation for the average Plebeian had declined significantly . Farmers became bankrupted , and soon masses of unemployed Plebeians began flooding into Rome , and thus into the ranks of the legislative assemblies , where their economic status usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most . A new culture of dependency was emerging , which would look to any populist leader for relief .",

The co @-@ rotational flow of cold magnetospheric plasma is partially diverted around them by the currents induced in their ionospheres , creating wedge @-@ shaped structures known as Alfvén wings . The interaction of the large moons with the co @-@ rotational flow is similar to the interaction of the solar wind with the non @-@ magnetized planets like Venus , although the co @-@ rotational speed is usually subsonic ( the speeds vary from 74 to 328 km / s ) , which prevents the formation of a bow shock . The pressure from the co @-@ rotating plasma continuously strips gases from the moons ' atmospheres ( especially from that of Io ) , and some of these atoms are ionized and brought into co @-@ rotation . This process creates gas and plasma tori in the vicinity of moons ' orbits with the Ionian torus being the most prominent .

Meanwhile , the energetic particles are largely unaffected by the Alfvén wings and have free access to the moons ' surfaces ( except Ganymede 's ) .",

  "When receptive to mating , a female blacktip reef shark swims slowly in a sinusoidal pattern near the bottom with her head pointed down ; observations in the wild suggest female sharks release chemical signals that allow males to track them . Once the male finds her , he closes to around 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) and follows her with his snout oriented towards her vent . A courting male may also bite the female behind her gills or on her pectoral fins ; these mating wounds heal completely after 4 – 6 weeks . After a period of synchronous swimming , the male pushes the female on her side and positions her so her head is against the bottom and her tail is raised . Once the female is in position , the male inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca . Copulation lasts for several minutes , after which the sharks separate and resume their regular behavior . Off Moorea , individual older females mate and give birth at a consistent time every year , often to within a week 's precision , whereas younger females exhibit more variability in their timing . Younger females are also more likely to fail to become pregnant after mating .",

The Constable of Castile moved his troops ( including soldiers recently transferred from the defense of Navarre ) southwest from Burgos to meet with the Admiral 's forces near Tordesillas . Meanwhile , the comuneros reinforced their troops at Torrelobatón , which was far less secure than the comuneros preferred . Their forces were suffering from desertions , and the presence of royalist artillery would make Torrelobatón 's castle vulnerable . Juan de Padilla considered withdrawing to Toro to seek reinforcements in early April , but wavered . He delayed his decision until the early hours of April 23 , losing considerable time and allowing the royalists to unite their forces in Peñaflor .",

  "In contrast to the unity of Classical Latin , the literary aesthetic of late antiquity has a tessellated quality that has been compared to the mosaics characteristic of the period . A continuing interest in the religious traditions of Rome prior to Christian dominion is found into the 5th century , with the Saturnalia of Macrobius and The Marriage of Philology and Mercury of Martianus Capella . Prominent Latin poets of late antiquity include Ausonius , Prudentius , Claudian , and Sidonius . Ausonius ( d. ca . 394 ) , the Bordelaise tutor of the emperor Gratian , was at least nominally a Christian , though throughout his occasionally obscene mixed @-@ genre poems , he retains a literary interest in the Greco @-@ Roman gods and even druidism . The imperial panegyrist Claudian ( d . 404 ) was a vir illustris who appears never to have converted . Prudentius ( d. ca . 413 ) , born in Hispania Tarraconensis and a fervent Christian , was thoroughly versed in the poets of the Classical tradition , and transforms their vision of poetry as a monument of immortality into an expression of the poet 's quest for eternal life culminating in Christian salvation . Sidonius ( d . 486 ) , a native of Lugdunum , was a Roman senator and bishop of Clermont who cultivated a traditional villa lifestyle as he watched the Western empire succumb to barbarian incursions . His poetry and collected letters offer a unique view of life in late Roman Gaul from the perspective of a man who \" survived the end of his world \" .",

  "Cameroon 's natural resources are very well suited to agriculture and arboriculture . An estimated 70 % of the population farms , and agriculture comprised an estimated 19 @.@ 8 % of GDP in 2009 . Most agriculture is done at the subsistence scale by local farmers using simple tools . They sell their surplus produce , and some maintain separate fields for commercial use . Urban centres are particularly reliant on peasant agriculture for their foodstuffs . Soils and climate on the coast encourage extensive commercial cultivation of bananas , cocoa , oil palms , rubber , and tea . Inland on the South Cameroon Plateau , cash crops include coffee , sugar , and tobacco . Coffee is a major cash crop in the western highlands , and in the north , natural conditions favour crops such as cotton , groundnuts , and rice .

The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to eighty individuals . Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce , while the rest of the members are smaller , sterile and function as workers . Some individuals are of intermediate size . They help with the rearing of the young and can take the place of a reproductive if one dies . The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile , but only become fertile if they establish a colony of their own .",

Flowers are produced all through the year , but there is a strong peak in autumn . Little else flowers within its range at this time , so it is a seasonally important source of food for nectariferous animals . Surveys have observed a range of animals feeding on the species , including a wide range of insects ; many species of bird including Phylidonyris novaehollandiae ( New Holland honeyeater ) , Anthochaera carunculata ( red wattlebird ) , Anthochaera chrysoptera ( little wattlebird ) , Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris ( eastern spinebill ) and Trichoglossus haematodus ( rainbow lorikeet ) ; and mammals such as Petaurus norfolcensis ( squirrel glider ) , Petaurus breviceps ( sugar glider ) , Acrobates pygmaeus ( feathertail glider ) and Pteropus poliocephalus ( grey @-@ headed flying fox ) .

The Old Ladies ( 1924 ) is a study of a timid elderly spinster exploited and eventually frightened to death by a predatory widow . Portrait of a Man with Red Hair ( 1925 ) depicts the malign influence of a manipulative , insane father on his family and others . Walpole described it to his fellow author Frank Swinnerton as \" a simple shocker which it has amused me like anything to write , and won 't bore you to read . \" In contrast he continued a series of stories for children , begun in 1919 with Jeremy , taking the young hero 's story forward with Jeremy and Hamlet ( the latter being the boy 's dog ) in 1923 , and Jeremy at Crale in 1927 .

  "Einstein 's 1905 predictions were verified experimentally in several ways in the first two decades of the 20th century , as recounted in Robert Millikan 's Nobel lecture . However , before Compton 's experiment showed that photons carried momentum proportional to their wave number ( 1922 ) , most physicists were reluctant to believe that electromagnetic radiation itself might be particulate . ( See , for example , the Nobel lectures of Wien , Planck and Millikan . ) Instead , there was a widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbed or emitted radiation . Attitudes changed over time . In part , the change can be traced to experiments such as Compton scattering , where it was much more difficult not to ascribe quantization to light itself to explain the observed results .",

Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon , traveling in a random direction , and so drop back to lower energy levels . Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output .

The score had reached 117 before Barnes was caught behind from Hollies for 61 . The opening stand had been compiled in only 126 minutes .

The decay of 40K to 40Ar is the basis of a common method for dating rocks . The conventional K @-@ Ar dating method depends on the assumption that the rocks contained no argon at the time of formation and that all the subsequent radiogenic argon ( 40Ar ) was quantitatively retained . Minerals are dated by measurement of the concentration of potassium and the amount of radiogenic 40Ar that has accumulated . The minerals best suited for dating include biotite , muscovite , metamorphic hornblende , and volcanic feldspar ; whole rock samples from volcanic flows and shallow instrusives can also be dated if they are unaltered . Apart from dating , potassium isotopes have been used as tracers in studies of weathering and for nutrient cycling studies because potassium is a macronutrient required for life .",

At last , however , with this loss , Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction , moving his corps to join at Charles ' northern flank . At Amberg on 24 August , Charles inflicted a defeat on the French , yet that same day , his commanders lost a battle to the French at Friedberg . Regardless , the tide had turned in the Coalition 's favor . Both Jourdan and Moreau had overstretched their lines , moving far into the German states , and were separated too far from each other for one to offer the other aid or security . The Coalition 's concentration of troops forced a wider wedge between the two armies of Jourdan and Moreau , similar to what the French had tried to do to Charles and Wartensleben . As the French withdrew toward the Rhine , Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward . On 3 September at Würzburg , Jourdan attempted to halt his retreat .

Christopher John Farley of Time magazine described the album as a \" beautifully restrained work \" , noting that Aaliyah 's \" girlish , breathy vocals rode calmly on R. Kelly 's rough beats \" . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic felt that the album had its \" share of filler \" , but described the singles as \" slyly seductive \" . He also claimed that the songs on the album were \" frequently better \" than that of Kelly 's second studio album , 12 Play . The single \" At Your Best ( You Are Love ) \" was criticized by Billboard for being out of place on the album and for its length .",

The purpose of art at this time — in architecture , the visual arts , and music — was not to create something entirely new , but to reflect this divine perfection , and in this way to praise God . We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach , 19 but only in a few cases is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass .",
  "Beginning near the end of the 2006 season , word began to surface that Favre was considering retirement . In fact , playing in Soldier Field against the arch @-@ rival Bears in the season finale , Favre was given a standing ovation in the closing seconds of the Packer victory as a show of respect from Chicago fans to their longtime nemesis . Moments later at the postgame interview , he gave a tearful interview with an NBC Sports correspondent , where he admitted his future was still questionable . However , after much debate , he returned for 2007 , during which his future was once again in doubt and an oft @-@ discussed topic , with many in the media speculating that if the Packers made the Super Bowl , Favre would indeed retire and hand the reins to the unproven but talented Aaron Rodgers , who was drafted two years earlier as Favre 's heir @-@ apparent .

Years earlier , the company merged with its daughter company , The American Musical Academy of Arts Association , which proved profitable as there was an upswing in demand for Christian @-@ based music and distribution opportunities . This was profitable as IAMAS was able to use its history in the entertainment industry as a door to help boost other smaller companies into existence . In 2004 , the entertainment industry took a huge hit with the incoming markets of Napster , iTunes , and Amazon.com.

  "Arguments over the projected displacement and armament prevented further work until October 1899 .

Captain Royal Bradford , the chief of the Bureau of Equipment , suggested that 18 @.@ 5 knots would be sufficient , though O 'Neill demanded 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) ; a compromise was found by requiring a minimum of 19 knots ( 35 km / h ; 22 mph ) . These compromises produced two variants : \" A \" , which arranged the 8 in guns in four twin turrets amidships as with the Indiana class , and \" B \" , which placed two of the four turrets atop the 12 in turrets , as on the Kearsarge class . The \" A \" design included sixteen 6 in guns in casemates , while \" B \" had only twelve .",
  "A generation later , the chronicler Æthelweard reported that it was popularly remembered as \" the great battle \" , and it sealed Æthelstan 's posthumous reputation as \" victorious because of God \" ( in the words of the homilist Ælfric of Eynsham ) . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle abandoned its usual terse style in favour of a heroic poem vaunting the great victory , employing imperial language to present Æthelstan as ruler of an empire of Britain . The site of the battle is uncertain , however , and over thirty sites have been suggested , with Bromborough on the Wirral the most favoured among historians .",

The colleges hold substantial autonomy over admissions , scholarships , programs and other academic and financial affairs , in addition to the housing and social duties of typical residential colleges . The system emerged in the 19th century , as ecclesiastical colleges considered various forms of union with the University of Toronto to ensure their viability .
