  "While approaching the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument , Neki weakened to tropical storm status . Continued wind shear exposed the circulation from the convection , although further weakening was slow to occur . On October 24 , Neki made its closest approach to land after passing within 13 mi ( 21 km ) of the uninhabited Necker Island . Its forward motion slowed due to a building ridge to the north , causing the storm to execute a small loop . Despite the shear , Neki was initially able to continue developing thunderstorms , although cooler water temperatures resulted in further weakening . The storm resumed its northward motion after the ridge receded to the east , and on October 26 Neki weakened to a tropical depression once the circulation decoupled from the thunderstorms . The next day it dissipated as the center became elongated ahead of an approaching cold front .",

  "During the flyby of July 14 , 2005 , the Composite Infrared Spectrometer ( CIRS ) found a warm region near the south pole . Temperatures in this region ranged from 85 – 90 K , with small areas showing as high as 157 K ( − 116 ° C ) , much too warm to be explained by solar heating , indicating that parts of the south polar region are heated from the interior of Enceladus . The presence of a subsurface ocean under the south polar region is now accepted , but it cannot explain the source of the heat , with an estimated heat flux of 200 mW / m2 , which is about 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating alone .",

  "Balzac 's spiritual crisis at the time of his first communion led him to explore the first Christian thinkers and the question of evil . As the French critic Philippe Bertault points out , much of the mysticism in Louis Lambert is related to that of early Christianity . In his letters , Lambert describes exploring the philosophies of Christianity , Hinduism , Buddhism , Islam , and Confucianism , among others . Tracing the similarities among these traditions , he declares that Swedenborg \" undoubtedly epitomizes all of the religions — or rather the one religion — of humanity \" . The same theory informs Balzac 's efforts , in Louis Lambert and elsewhere , to complement his Christian beliefs with occult mysticism and secular realism .",

Hearing of Warbrick 's plans , civil servant Thomas Eyton contacted him to offer help managing the tour , which Warbrick accepted . By May 1888 , James Scott , a publican , had joined the partnership . The three men decided that Warbrick would be the team 's captain , coach and selector , Scott its manager , and Eyton its promoter . Although Warbrick had chiefly sporting reasons for conducting the tour , for Eyton and Scott profit was the major motivation .",

  "Brain imaging shows that people have more active hippocampi when correctly navigating , as tested in a computer @-@ simulated \" virtual \" navigation task . Also , there is evidence that the hippocampus plays a role in finding shortcuts and new routes between familiar places . For example , London 's taxi drivers must learn a large number of places and the most direct routes between them ( they have to pass a strict test , The Knowledge , before being licensed to drive the famous black cabs ) . A study at University College London by Maguire , et al .. ( 2000 ) showed that part of the hippocampus is larger in taxi drivers than in the general public , and that more experienced drivers have bigger hippocampi . Whether having a bigger hippocampus helps an individual to become a better cab driver , or if finding shortcuts for a living makes an individual 's hippocampus grow is yet to be elucidated . However , in that study , Maguire et al. examined the correlation between size of the grey matter and length of time that had been spent as a taxi driver , and found a positive correlation between the length of time an individual had spent as a taxi driver and the volume of the right hippocampus . It was found that the total volume of the hippocampus remained constant , from the control group vs. taxi drivers . That is to say that the posterior portion of a taxi driver 's hippocampus is indeed increased , but at the expense of the anterior portion . There have been no known detrimental effects reported from this disparity in hippocampal proportions .",

  "To be specific , MS involves the loss of oligodendrocytes , the cells responsible for creating and maintaining a fatty layer — known as the myelin sheath — which helps the neurons carry electrical signals ( action potentials ) . This results in a thinning or complete loss of myelin and , as the disease advances , the breakdown of the axons of neurons . When the myelin is lost , a neuron can no longer effectively conduct electrical signals . A repair process , called remyelination , takes place in early phases of the disease , but the oligodendrocytes are unable to completely rebuild the cell 's myelin sheath . Repeated attacks lead to successively less effective remyelinations , until a scar @-@ like plaque is built up around the damaged axons . These scars are the origin of the symptoms and during an attack magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) often shows more than ten new plaques . This could indicate that there are a number of lesions below which the brain is capable of repairing itself without producing noticeable consequences . Another process involved in the creation of lesions is an abnormal increase in the number of astrocytes due to the destruction of nearby neurons . A number of lesion patterns have been described .",

  "A different concern about water quality arose when mercury was discovered in fish during the 1980s . Because mercury is damaging to humans , warnings were posted for fishermen that cautioned against eating fish caught in South Florida , and scientists became alarmed when a Florida panther was found dead near Shark River Slough with mercury levels high enough to be fatal to humans . When mercury is ingested it adversely affects the central nervous system , and can cause brain damage and birth defects . Studies of mercury levels found that it is bioaccumulated through the food chain : animals that are lower on the chain have decreased amounts , but as larger animals eat them , the amount of mercury is multiplied . The dead panther 's diet consisted of small animals , including raccoons and young alligators . The source of the mercury was found to be waste incinerators and fossil fuel power plants that expelled the element in the atmosphere , which precipitated with rain , or in the dry season , dust . Naturally occurring bacteria in the Everglades that function to reduce sulfur also transform mercury deposits into methylmercury . This process was more dramatic in areas where flooding was not as prevalent . Because of requirements that reduced power plant and incinerator emissions , the levels of mercury found in larger animals decreased as well : approximately a 60 % decrease in fish and a 70 % decrease in birds , though some levels still remain a health concern for people .",

  "Proboscideans experienced several evolutionary trends , such as an increase in size , which led to many giant species that stood up to 4 m ( 13 ft ) tall . As with other megaherbivores , including the extinct sauropod dinosaurs , the large size of elephants likely developed to allow them to survive on vegetation with low nutritional value . Their limbs grew longer and the feet shorter and broader . Early proboscideans developed longer mandibles and smaller craniums , while more advanced ones developed shorter mandibles , which shifted the head 's centre of gravity . The skull grew larger , especially the cranium , while the neck shortened to provide better support for the skull . The increase in size led to the development and elongation of the mobile trunk to provide reach . The number of premolars , incisors and canines decreased . The cheek teeth ( molars and premolars ) became larger and more specialized , especially after elephants started to switch from C3 @-@ plants to C4 @-@ grasses , which caused their teeth to undergo a three @-@ fold increase in teeth height as well as substantial multiplication of lamellae after about five million years ago . Only in the last million year or so did they return to a diet mainly consisting of C3 trees and shrubs . The upper second incisors grew into tusks , which varied in shape from straight , to curved ( either upward or downward ) , to spiralled , depending on the species . Some proboscideans developed tusks from their lower incisors . Elephants retain certain features from their aquatic ancestry such as their middle ear anatomy and the internal testes of the males .",

  "In 1876 Morton was a contender for the Republican nomination for president at the party 's National Convention in Cincinnati , Ohio . Richard W.

Gōzō Shioda 's Yoshinkan Aikido , considered one of the \" hard styles , \" largely follows Ueshiba 's teachings from before World War II , and surmises that the secret to ki lies in timing and the application of the whole body 's strength to a single point . In later years , Ueshiba 's application of ki in aikido took on a softer , more gentle feel . This was his Takemusu Aiki and many of his later students teach about ki from this perspective . Koichi Tohei 's Ki Society centers almost exclusively around the study of the empirical ( albeit subjective ) experience of ki with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and ki development .",

  "The main fortifications for infantry consisted of 44 concrete bunkers , 23 dugouts and 26 fortified observation posts . The concrete bunkers ( infanteriskansar , redoubts ) were long and narrow . The longest , Abramsskansen , was 155 metres ( 509 ft ) long and had room for 160 men and four machine guns , but most had room for less than 80 men — usually a rifle platoon reinforced with a machine gun section and an anti @-@ tank section . Due to their length , their curved shapes following the mountain sides , and other characteristics , the bunkers were popularly referred to as \" sausages \" ( korvar ) . The construction of these started in 1911 . Many officers still considered the fortress to have inadequate and too few fortifications for the infantry , and one officer compared the fortress to \" a shoe , which is too large for the foot . \" One million kronor was allocated in 1915 to fix that problem , and many minor fortifications were built during the First World War .",

Burrows points out that many of Handel 's operas , of comparable length and structure to Messiah , were composed within similar timescales between theatrical seasons . The effort of writing so much music in so short a time was not unusual for Handel and his contemporaries ; Handel commenced his next oratorio , Samson , within a week of finishing Messiah , and completed his draft of this new work in a month . In accordance with his frequent practice when writing new works , Handel adapted existing compositions for use in Messiah , in this case drawing on two recently completed Italian duets and one written twenty years previously . Thus , Se tu non lasci amore from 1722 became the basis of \" O Death , where is thy sting ? \" ; \" His yoke is easy \" and \" And he shall purify \" were drawn from Quel fior che alla 'ride ( July 1741 ) , \" Unto us a child is born \" and \" All we like sheep \" from Nò , di voi non vo ' fidarmi ( July 1741 ) . Handel 's instrumentation in the score is often imprecise , again in line with contemporary convention , where the use of certain instruments and combinations was assumed and did not need to be written down by the composer ; later copyists would fill in the details .",

  "Cacti can be propagated by seed , cuttings or grafting . Seed sown early in the year produces seedlings that benefit from a longer growing period . Seed is sown in a moist growing medium and then kept in a covered environment , until 7 – 10 days after germination , to avoid drying out . A very wet growing medium can cause both seeds and seedlings to rot . A temperature range of 18 – 30 ° C ( 64 – 86 ° F ) is suggested for germination ; soil temperatures of around 22 ° C ( 72 ° F ) promote the best root growth . Low light levels are sufficient during germination , but afterwards semi @-@ desert cacti need higher light levels to produce strong growth , although acclimatization is needed to conditions in a greenhouse , such as higher temperatures and strong sunlight .",

  "The competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices . Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell . At first , as the electric field increases in magnitude , no change in alignment occurs . However at a threshold magnitude of electric field , deformation occurs . Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next . The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength .",

Shortly after taking office , Hume helped scuttle a bill to repeal a law passed in 1899 that gave the owner of tidelands the exclusive right to fish the waters in front of them . Since Hume owned all the tidelands on the Rogue , the law gave him a monopoly on fishing its lower reaches . On issues unrelated to his business interests , Hume generally voted conservative .

  "The death cap was first described by French botanist Sébastien Vaillant in 1727 , who gave a succinct phrase name \" Fungus phalloides , annulatus , sordide virescens , et patulus \" , which is still recognizable as the fungus today . Though the scientific name phalloides means \" phallus @-@ shaped \" , it is unclear whether it is named for its resemblance to a literal phallus or the stinkhorn mushrooms Phallus . In 1821 , Elias Magnus Fries described it as Agaricus phalloides , but included all white amanitas within its description . Finally in 1833 , Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link settled on the name Amanita phalloides , after Persoon had named it Amanita viridis 30 years earlier . Although Louis Secretan 's use of the name Amanita phalloides predates Link 's , it has been rejected for nomenclatural purposes because Secretan 's works did not use binomial nomenclature consistently ; some taxonomists have , however , disagreed with this opinion .",

  "The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of presettlement forests of eastern North America . For instance , while the passenger pigeon was extant , forests were dominated by white oaks . This species germinated in the fall , therefore producing acorns during the spring to be devoured and spread by the pigeons . The absence of the passenger pigeon 's seed dispersal may have led to the modern dominance of red oaks . At roosting sites , few plants grew for years after the pigeons left . Also , the immense amount of dung present at these sites increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires . With the large numbers in the flocks , the excrement they produced was enough to destroy surface @-@ level vegetation , and along with the breaking of treelimbs under their collective weight , the passenger pigeons could do significant damage to forests . Due to these influences , some ecologists have considered the passenger pigeon a keystone species . The American chestnut trees that provided much of the mast on which the passenger pigeon fed was itself almost driven to extinction by an imported Asian fungus ( chestnut blight ) around 1905 . As many as thirty billion trees are thought to have died as a result in the following decades , but this did not affect the passenger pigeon , which was already extinct in the wild at the time .",

  "Contrasted with World War I , there was relatively little violation of civil liberties during World War II .

The most significant exception was the internment of Japanese Americans .

In addition to the non @-@ citizen Issei ( prohibited from naturalization as members of an \" unassimilable \" race ) , over two @-@ thirds of those swept up were American @-@ born citizens . The ACLU immediately protested to Roosevelt , comparing the evacuations to Nazi concentration camps . The ACLU was the only major organization to object to the internment plan , and their position was very unpopular , even within the organization . Not all ACLU leaders wanted to defend the Japanese Americans ; Roosevelt loyalists such as Morris Ernst wanted to support Roosevelt 's war effort , but pacifists such as Baldwin and Norman Thomas felt that Japanese Americans needed access to due process before they could be imprisoned . In a March 20 , 1942 letter to Roosevelt , Baldwin called on the administration to allow Japanese Americans to prove their loyalty at individual hearings , describing the constitutionality of the planned removal \" open to grave question . \" His suggestions went nowhere , and opinions within the organization became increasingly divided as the Army began the \" evacuation \" of the West Coast . In May , the two factions , one pushing to fight the exclusion orders then being issued , the other advocating support for the President 's policy of removing citizens whose \" presence may endanger national security , \" brought their opposing resolutions to a vote before the board and the ACLU 's national leaders . They decided not to challenge the eviction of Japanese American citizens , and on June 22 instructions were sent to West Coast branches not to support cases that argued the government had no constitutional right to do so .",

  "The episode was written by Jonathan Collier and directed by Mike B. Anderson . The story was inspired by the real events surrounding the exhumation of President Zachary Taylor . In the late 1980s , college professor and author Clara Rising theorized that Taylor was murdered by poison and was able to convince Taylor 's closest living relative and the Coroner of Jefferson County , Kentucky , to order an exhumation . On June 17 , 1991 , Taylor 's remains were exhumed and transported to the Office of the Kentucky Chief Medical Examiner , who found that the level of arsenic was much smaller than would be expected if Taylor had been thus poisoned .

  "Due to the rapid motion of Nanmadol , the typhoon crossed Luzon in under six hours , emerging into the South China Sea before 1800 UTC on December 2 . Though land interaction with the Philippines did not significantly affect the cyclone , a shortwave trough forced Nanmadol to sharply curve northward , bringing it into hostile atmospheric conditions within the Luzon Strait . At 0000 UTC on December 3 , the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to severe tropical storm status . Increased wind shear and the advection of dry air further weakened the tropical cyclone , and by midday on December 3 , the storm 's center of circulation became decoupled from the rest of the convection .

  "To build their nests , termites primarily use faeces , which have many desirable properties as a construction material . Other building materials include partly digested plant material , used in carton nests ( arboreal nests built from faecal elements and wood ) , and soil , used in subterranean nest and mound construction . Not all nests are visible , as many nests in tropical forests are located underground . Species in the subfamily Apicotermitinae are good examples of subterranean nest builders , as they only dwell inside tunnels . Other termites live in wood , and tunnels are constructed as they feed on the wood . Nests and mounds protect the termites ' soft bodies against desiccation , light , pathogens and parasites , as well as providing a fortification against predators . Nests made out of carton are particularly weak , and so the inhabitants use counter @-@ attack strategies against invading predators .",

  "By the later seventeenth century both the Presbyterian and episcopalian wings of the church had adopted the modestly sized and plain form of churches that had emerged after the Reformation . Most had a centralised plan with two or three arms , in a rectangular or T @-@ planned arrangement . Steeples continued to be a major feature , either centrally on the long axis , or on an end gable , in as had been the case in pre @-@ Reformation churches . As a result , there was little of the baroque extravagance in church building seen on the Continent and England . Some minor innovations may indicate a move back toward episcopacy in the Restoration era . Lauder Church was built by Sir William Bruce in 1673 for the Duke of Lauderdale , who championed the bishops in the reign of Charles II and the Gothic windows of which may have emphasised antiquity , but its basic Greek cross plan remained within the common framework of new churches . The drive to episcopalian forms of worship may have resulted in more linear patterns , including rectangular plans with the pulpit on the end opposite the entrance . The major exceptions to the standard pattern are in the work of James Smith , who had become a Jesuit in his youth . These included the rebuilding of Holyrood Abbey undertaken for James VII in 1687 , which was outfitted in an elaborate style . In 1691 Smith designed the mausoleum of Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh , in Greyfriars Kirkyard , a circular structure modelled on the Tempietto di San Pietro , designed by Donato Bramante ( 1444 – 1514 ) . The Latin Cross form , increasingly popular in Counter Reformation Catholicism , was also used , as in Smith 's Canongate Kirk ( 1688 – 90 ) , but here it never saw episcopal service as the Presbyterian revolution of 1689 – 90 occurred before it was completed and the chancel was blocked up , making it , in effect , a T @-@ plan .",
  "During the Classic period the major branches began diversifying into separate languages . The split between Proto @-@ Yucatecan ( in the north , that is , the Yucatán Peninsula ) and Proto @-@ Ch 'olan ( in the south , that is , the Chiapas highlands and Petén Basin ) had already occurred by the Classic period , when most extant Maya inscriptions were written . Both variants are attested in hieroglyphic inscriptions at the Maya sites of the time , and both are commonly referred to as \" Classic Maya language \" . Although a single prestige language was by far the most frequently recorded on extant hieroglyphic texts , evidence for at least five different varieties of Mayan have been discovered within the hieroglyphic corpus — an Eastern Ch 'olan variety found in texts written in the southern Maya area and the highlands , a Western Ch 'olan variety diffused from the Usumacinta region from the mid @-@ 7th century on , a Yukatekan variety found in the texts from the Yucatán Peninsula , a Tzeltalan variety found in the Western Lowlands ( i.e. Toniná , Pomona ) , and possibly a highland Maya language belonging to K 'ichean major within texts painted on Nebaj ceramics . The reason why only few linguistic varieties are found in the glyphic texts is probably that these served as prestige dialects throughout the Maya region ; hieroglyphic texts would have been composed in the language of the elite .",

  "The sides of the Tor have seven deep , roughly symmetrical terraces . Their formation remains a mystery with many possible explanations .

If agriculture had been the reason for the creation of the terraces , it would be expected that the effort would be concentrated on the south side , where the sunny conditions would provide a good yield , but the terraces are equally deep on the northern side , which would provide little benefit . Additionally , none of the other slopes of the island have been terraced , even though the more sheltered locations would provide a greater return on the labour involved .

  "A paradox in metabolism is that , while the vast majority of complex life on Earth requires oxygen for its existence , oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing reactive oxygen species . Consequently , organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as DNA , proteins and lipids . In general , antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed , or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell . However , reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions , such as redox signaling . Thus , the function of antioxidant systems is not to remove oxidants entirely , but instead to keep them at an optimum level .",

  "Geoffrey Marshall has characterised section 3 as a \" deeply mysterious provision \" in several respects , including judging how strong a provision it is – an issue since dealt with by the courts – but has also noted a disparity between what the Act might be expected to do and what it does . He argues that a litigant would hope that courts would strive to uphold his rights under the Convention , accepting a derivation from them only rarely ; instead section 3 requires courts to find compatibility with the Convention where possible – in other words , to strive to find that the Convention does not impact the claimant . Alison L. Young has examined the upper boundaries to courts ' powers of interpretation . She puts forward three possible limits : firstly , where the text of a statute is not ambiguous ; secondly , where reading in words is inappropriate ; and , thirdly , where any interpretation is restricted to cases where it does not involve implied repeal . Young dismisses the first two as incompatible with the legislative history ( and , in at least the first case , judicial history ) and believes the third to present no rigid limit on courts ' powers at all . The decision of Pepper v Hart provides a method for the legislative history of a bill to play a role in its interpretation .",

  "The arrival of humans on the island 1 @,@ 500 to 2 @,@ 000 years ago has taken a significant toll , not only on the size of lemur populations , but also on their diversity . Due to habitat destruction and hunting , at least 17 species and 8 genera have gone extinct and many others have become threatened . Historically , lemurs ranged across the entire island inhabiting a wide variety of habitats , including dry deciduous forests , lowland forests , spiny thickets , subhumid forests , montane forest , and mangrove . Today , their collective range is restricted to 10 % of the island , or approximately 60 @,@ 000 km2 ( 23 @,@ 000 sq mi ) .

  "The publishing company sought an injunction to prevent the ban , and the case came before Judge Hand . In July 1917 , he ruled that the journal should not be barred from distribution through the mail . Though The Masses supported those who refused to serve in the forces , its text did not , in Hand 's view , tell readers that they must violate the law . Hand argued that suspect material should be judged on what he called an \" incitement test \" : only if its language directly urged readers to violate the law was it seditious — otherwise freedom of speech should be protected . This focus on the words themselves , rather than on their effect , was novel and daring ; but Hand 's decision was promptly stayed , and later overturned on appeal . He always maintained that his ruling had been correct . Between 1918 and 1919 , he attempted to convince Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes , a man he greatly admired , of his argument . His efforts at first appeared fruitless , but Holmes ' dissenting opinion in Abrams v. United States in November 1919 urged greater protection of political speech . Scholars have credited the critiques of Hand , Ernst Freund , Louis Brandeis , and Zechariah Chafee for the change in Holmes 's views . In the long @-@ term , Hand 's decision proved a landmark in the history of free speech in the country . In Brandenburg v.

Only 5 % of imports were carried on Irish flagged vessels .

  "Carr begins his argument by reasoning how the capacity to concentrate may be weakened by regular Internet usage . He mentions a historical example involving Friedrich Nietzsche 's usage of a typewriter , a fairly new technology in the 1880s . According to German scholar Friedrich A. Kittler , Nietzsche 's prose style changed when he started using a typewriter , which he had adopted because of his developing difficulty with writing by hand due to failing eyesight . Carr proceeds to explain that scientific research in the field of neuroplasticity as of 2008 has demonstrated that the brain 's neural circuitry can in fact be rewired . In the humanities , sociologist Daniel Bell coined the term \" intellectual technologies \" to describe those technologies that extend the brain 's cognitive faculties , and Carr states that he believes that the human brain adopts the qualities of these intellectual technologies . In discussing the mechanical clock , Carr deliberates upon the benefits and losses that are characteristic of new technologies . Then , Carr ventures that the cognitive impact of the Internet may be far more encompassing than any other previous intellectual technology because the Internet is gradually performing the services of most intellectual technologies , thus replacing them . Carr finally contends that the prevalent style of presentation for much of the Internet 's content may significantly hinder the capacity to concentrate due to the many distractions that often surround the Internet 's content , in the form of ads and obtrusive notifications . Additionally , he claims that these detrimental effects on concentration are compounded by traditional media because they are gradually adopting a style of presentation for their content that mimics the Internet , in order to remain competitive as consumer expectations change .",

  "The case was actually two actions , with the first judgement being given in Denny 's favour after Coke 's research found a flaw in the pleadings that invalidated Cromwell 's case .

  "Aetosaurs were very heavily armored ( most certainly as a defense against predators ) , with large quadrangular , interlocking bony plates , or osteoderms , protecting the back and sides , belly , and tail . Most osteoderms are heavily pitted on their upper surfaces and smooth on their undersides . Their centers are made of cancellous or spongy bone ( also called diploë ) and their outer portions are made up of compact bone . In life , these plates were probably covered in horn . Dorsal osteoderms , which are found on the backs of aetosaurs , are often ornamented with radial grooves . Dorsal paramedians , those found along the midline of the animal , are often wide and quadrangular with a small boss called a dorsal eminence on the dorsal surface of each plate . In aetosaurs , paramedian plates often have raised or depressed anterior edges where the plates articulate with the ones in front of them . If the anterior edge is raised , the area is called an anterior bar , while if it is depressed , the area is called an anterior lamina . In lateral plates , which are positioned on either side of the paramedian plates , the dorsal eminence is often enlarged into a prominent spike . This spike is especially noticeable in desmatosuchines such as Longosuchus and Desmatosuchus . Osteoderms are useful in diagnosing aetosaur taxa , and aetosaur species can often be identified from individual scutes based on their ornamentation pattern .",

  "While the urban United States experienced an economic boom during the 1920s , the agricultural sector of the country experienced a depression . Disruption of European agriculture by World War I had produced high prices for farm commodities , and it had been thought that Europe 's recovery would be slow and that the high prices would persist . This gave rise to a bubble in farmland prices , which burst when the rapid postwar recovery of European agriculture drove commodity prices down again . At the same time , increasing mechanization reduced the need for farm labor , pushing agricultural wages downward and rural unemployment upward . Madison and St. Leonard 's parish suffered from this agricultural depression and from the Great Depression of the 1930s . During this time , the parish 's population remained more or less stable : in 1918 , it consisted of 440 individuals ; in 1929 , 452 .",

She had what one analyst described as \" a rare ability to enter into the feelings of the uncommunicative and to bring to life the emotions of the unremarkable \" . Some of Gibbons 's poetry expressed her love of nature and a prophetic awareness for environmental issues such as sea pollution , decades before such concerns became fashionable . In a critical summary of Gibbons 's poems , Loralee MacPike has described them as \" slight lyrics ...

  "The Christianisation of Scotland was carried out by Irish @-@ Scots missionaries and to a lesser extent those from Rome and England . Richard Fletcher argued that motivations may have included the example of St. Patrick , the idea of Peregrinatio and a growing interest in evangelism . In the sixth century missionaries from Ireland were operating on the British mainland . This movement is traditionally associated with the figures of St Ninian , St Kentigern and St Columba . Ninian is now regarded as a later construct and may have been the result of scribal confusion with the Irish saint Finnian . There was a church dedicated to him at Whithorn in the sixth century and from there St Kentigern seems to have created a new centre of worship at Govan or Inchinnan , from where Christian influence extended across the Strathclyde region . St Columba was probably a disciple of Finnian . He left Ireland after being exiled , and founded the monastery at Iona off the west coast of Scotland in 563 . From there missions were carried out to western Argyll and the islands around Mull . Later the influence of Iona would extend to the Hebrides . In the seventh century , St. Aidan went from Iona to found a church at Lindisfarne off the east coast of Northumbria . The influence of Lindisfarne would spread through the kingdom of Northumbria into what is now south @-@ east Scotland . The result was a series of overlapping and informally organised churches . Iona emerged as the most important religious centre , partly as a result of the work of Adomnan , who was abbot there from 679 to 704 .

  "The monument 's three divisions symbolize the three \" realms \" of Buddhist cosmology , namely Kamadhatu ( the world of desires ) , Rupadhatu ( the world of forms ) , and finally Arupadhatu ( the formless world ) . Ordinary sentient beings live out their lives on the lowest level , the realm of desire . Those who have burnt out all desire for continued existence leave the world of desire and live in the world on the level of form alone : they see forms but are not drawn to them . Finally , full Buddhas go beyond even form and experience reality at its purest , most fundamental level , the formless ocean of nirvana . The liberation from the cycle of Saṃsāra where the enlightened soul had no longer attached to worldly form corresponds to the concept of Śūnyatā , the complete voidness or the nonexistence of the self . Kāmadhātu is represented by the base , Rupadhatu by the five square platforms ( the body ) , and Arupadhatu by the three circular platforms and the large topmost stupa . The architectural features between the three stages have metaphorical differences . For instance , square and detailed decorations in the Rupadhatu disappear into plain circular platforms in the Arupadhatu to represent how the world of forms — where men are still attached with forms and names — changes into the world of the formless .",

  "One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed ( but not understood at the time ) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen , half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived . Maxwell observed that the specific heat capacity of H2 unaccountably departs from that of a diatomic gas below room temperature and begins to increasingly resemble that of a monatomic gas at cryogenic temperatures . According to quantum theory , this behavior arises from the spacing of the ( quantized ) rotational energy levels , which are particularly wide @-@ spaced in H2 because of its low mass . These widely spaced levels inhibit equal partition of heat energy into rotational motion in hydrogen at low temperatures . Diatomic gases composed of heavier atoms do not have such widely spaced levels and do not exhibit the same effect .",

  "Grand Teton National Park is a popular destination for mountain and rock climbers partly because the mountains are easily accessible by road . Trails are well marked and routes to the summits of most peaks are long established , and for the experienced and fit , most peaks can be climbed in one day . The highest maintained trails climb from the floor of Jackson Hole over 4 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 200 m ) to mountain passes that are sometimes called saddles or divides . From these passes , the climbs follow routes that require varying skill levels . Climbers do not need a permit but are encouraged to voluntarily register their climbing plans with the National Park Service and inform associates of their itinerary . Any climb requiring an overnight stay in the backcountry does require a permit .

  "This lengthening has received a number of different explanations within the context of theoretical phonology . All accounts agree that some property of the fortis sonorant is being transferred to the preceding vowel , but the details about what property that is vary from researcher to researcher . Ó Siadhail & Wigger ( 1975 : 89 – 90 ) argue that the fortis sonorant is tense ( a term only vaguely defined phonetically ) and that this tenseness is transferred to the vowel , where it is realized phonetically as vowel length and / or diphthongization . Ní Chiosáin ( 1991 : 188 – 95 ) argues that the triggering consonant is underlyingly associated with a unit of syllable weight called a mora ; this mora then shifts to the vowel , creating a long vowel or a diphthong . Carnie ( 2002 ) expands on that analysis to argue that the fortis sonorants have an advanced tongue root ( that is , the bottom of the tongue is pushed upward during articulation of the consonant ) and that diphthongization is an articulatory effect of this tongue movement .",

  "Stars far more massive than the sun evolve in more complex ways . In the core of the star , hydrogen is fused into helium , releasing thermal energy that heats the sun 's core and provides outward pressure that supports the sun 's layers against collapse in a process known as stellar or hydrostatic equilibrium . The helium produced in the core accumulates there since temperatures in the core are not yet high enough to cause it to fuse . Eventually , as the hydrogen at the core is exhausted , fusion starts to slow down , and gravity causes the core to contract . This contraction raises the temperature high enough to initiate a shorter phase of helium fusion , which accounts for less than 10 % of the star 's total lifetime . In stars with fewer than eight solar masses , the carbon produced by helium fusion does not fuse , and the star gradually cools to become a white dwarf . White dwarf stars , if they have a near companion , may then become Type Ia supernovae .",

  "Suillus salmonicolor , commonly known as the slippery Jill , is a fungus in the family Suillaceae of the order Boletales . First described as a member of the genus Boletus in 1874 , the species acquired several synonyms , including Suillus pinorigidus and Suillus subluteus , before it was assigned its current binomial name in 1983 . It has not been determined with certainty whether S. salmonicolor is distinct from the species S. cothurnatus , described by Rolf Singer in 1945 . S. salmonicolor is a mycorrhizal fungus — meaning it forms a symbiotic association with the roots of plants such that both organisms benefit from the exchange of nutrients . This symbiosis occurs with various species of pine , and the fruit bodies ( or mushrooms ) of the fungus appear scattered or in groups on the ground near the trees . The fungus is found in North America ( including Hawaii ) , Asia , the Caribbean , South Africa , Australia and Central America . It has been introduced to several of those locations via transplanted trees .",

  "Following the Battle of Glen Fruin , between Clan Gregor and Clan Colquhoun in February 1603 , there was much public outcry against the rebellious MacGregors . By an Act of the Privy Council , on 3 April 1603 , it was made an offence to bear the name MacGregor , or to give and shelter to a MacGregor . The Earl of Argyll , who was responsible to the Privy Council for the actions of the MacGregors , was entrusted to bring the force of the law against this lawless clan . Being deeply suspicious of Ardincaple 's dealings with Glenstrae , one of Argyll 's first moves was to bring acts against Ardincaple . On 17 March 1603 , Aulay MacAulay of Ardincaple and his sureties were ordered to appear and answer for aiding , supplying , and intercommuning with Alasdair MacGregor of Glenstrae and other MacGregors . He was also to answer for not \" rising ye fray \" and pursuing the outlawed clan Gregor in the Lennox . Ardincaple was accused of bringing the MacGregor \" thevis and rebells \" to the Colquhoun lands of Luss and for their part in stealing from the Colquhouns of Luss . Again the influence of the Duke of Lennox saved Ardincaple and his clan from the same fate as Glenstrae and his . On 7 April 1603 , James VI wrote from Berwick to the Justice General and his deputies , declaring Ardincaple to be innocent of the alleged crimes and that he was to accompany the king to England with the Duke of Lennox . By the time the King 's letter was received , Ardincaple had already left the Lennox district as part of the Duke of Lennox 's train , which accompanied James VI on his way to England to be declared King James I of England . The outlawed Glenstrae was finally apprehended by Argyll on 18 January 1604 after almost a year in hiding. and brought to Edinburgh to stand trial . The illiterate Glenstrae consented to give a preliminary statement which was titled a ' confession ' and convicted him out of his own mouth . Within his ' confession ' , Glenstrae accused Argyll of trying to persuade him to kill the chief of the MacAulays : \" I Confess , before God , that he did all his craftie diligence to intyse me to slay and destroy the Laird Ardinkaippill , Mckallay , for ony ganes kyndness or freindschip that he mycht do or gif me .

  "The Carménère grape has known origins in the Médoc region of Bordeaux , France and was also widely planted in the Graves until the vines were struck with oidium .

When the vineyards were replanted , growers could not replant Carménère as it was extremely hard to find and more difficult to grow than other grape varieties common to Bordeaux . The region 's damp , chilly spring weather gave rise to coulure , \" a condition endemic to certain vines in climates which have marginal , sometimes cool , wet springs \" , which prevented the vine 's buds from flowering .

  "The Nueces estuary provides an ecosystem for a wide variety of wildlife . However , since the construction of Choke Canyon Reservoir in 1985 , freshwater inflows have decreased from the Nueces River , increasing the bay 's salinity , and hurting the natural oyster and shrimp habitat . In response , the City of Corpus Christi , Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and two additional state agencies have worked to restore the natural freshwater inflows into the bay . The Odem Bay extension is low in salinity and serves as a nursery for shrimp , which migrate to Nueces Bay in spring . Oyster beds are common throughout the bay and are known to be hiding spots for such fish as trout , black drum , flounder and redfish . Such finfish must be protected from excessive freshwater introduction for survival .",

Its surface shows a strong opposition surge : its reflectivity decreases from 31 % at a phase angle of 0 ° ( geometrical albedo ) to 22 % at an angle of about 1 ° . Oberon has a low Bond albedo of about 14 % . Its surface is generally red in color , except for fresh impact deposits , which are neutral or slightly blue . Oberon is , in fact , the reddest among the major Uranian moons . Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical : the latter is much redder than the former , because it contains more dark red material . The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System . However , the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material spiraling in from outer parts of the Uranian system , possibly from irregular satellites , which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere .",
  "During the afternoon of July 16 , 1904 , a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3 : 30 pm EST in Chappaqua , New York . Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region . The sky was reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced .

  "The basic concepts of most DKP systems are simple . Players are given points for participating in raids or other guild events and spend those points on the item of their choice when the boss ' drops ' the item . A player who does not get a chance to spend their DKP accumulates it between raids and is able to spend it in the future . These points , while earned and spent like currency , are not the same thing as the virtual currency provided by the game company for the virtual world . The points themselves represent only the social contract that guilds extend to players . Should that player leave the guild or the guild disband , those points become valueless . These measures vary considerably in usage . Some guilds eschew formalized ' loot ' systems completely , allowing guild leaders to direct which players receive items from bosses . Some use complex measures to determine item price while others use an auction system to allocate goods via bidding . A few common variations are described below .",

  "The battle has been described as one of the most decisive of the ancient world . The forces of Athens and Thebes were destroyed , and continued resistance was impossible ; the war therefore came to an abrupt end . Philip was able to impose a settlement upon Greece , which all states accepted , with the exception of Sparta . The League of Corinth , formed as a result , made all participants allies of Macedon and each other , with Philip as the guarantor of the peace . In turn , Philip was voted as strategos ( general ) for a pan @-@ Hellenic war against the Persian Empire , which he had long planned .

  "Of even greater significance than our tactical successes has been the clear revelation that this new enemy , Red China , of such exaggerated and vaunted military power , lacks the industrial capability to provide adequately many critical items necessary to the conduct of modern war . He lacks the manufacturing base and those raw materials needed to produce , maintain and operate even moderate air and naval power , and he cannot provide the essentials for successful ground operations , such as tanks , heavy artillery and other refinements science has introduced into the conduct of military campaigns . Formerly his great numerical potential might well have filled this gap but with the development of existing methods of mass destruction numbers alone do not offset the vulnerability inherent in such deficiencies . Control of the seas and the air , which in turn means control over supplies , communications and transportation , are no less essential and decisive now than in the past . When this control exists , as in our case , and is coupled with an inferiority of ground firepower in the enemy 's case , the resulting disparity is such that it cannot be overcome by bravery , however fanatical , or the most gross indifference to human loss .",

  "Many scholars have discussed at length the film 's depiction of academia and youth culture .

Regarding not specifically teachers , but rather a type of adult characterization in general , Art Silverblatt asserts that the \" adults in Ferris Bueller 's Day Off are irrelevant and impotent . Ferris 's nemesis , the school disciplinarian , Mr. Rooney , is obsessed with ' getting Bueller . ' His obsession emerges from envy . Strangely , Ferris serves as Rooney 's role model , as he clearly possesses the imagination and power that Rooney lacks . ... By capturing and disempowering Ferris , Rooney hopes to ... reduce Ferris 's influence over other students , which would reestablish adults , that is , Rooney , as traditional authority figures . \" Nevertheless , Silverblatt concludes that \" Rooney is essentially a comedic figure , whose bumbling attempts to discipline Ferris are a primary source of humor in the film \" . Thomas Patrick Doherty writes that \" the adult villains in teenpics such as ... Ferris Bueller 's Day Off ( 1986 ) are overdrawn caricatures , no real threat ; they 're played for laughs \" .

  "In February 2013 Bloomberg New Energy Finance ( BNEF ) reported that the cost of generating electricity from new wind farms is cheaper than new coal or new baseload gas plants . When including the current Australian federal government carbon pricing scheme their modeling gives costs ( in Australian dollars ) of $ 80 / MWh for new wind farms , $ 143 / MWh for new coal plants and $ 116 / MWh for new baseload gas plants . The modeling also shows that \" even without a carbon price ( the most efficient way to reduce economy @-@ wide emissions ) wind energy is 14 % cheaper than new coal and 18 % cheaper than new gas . \" Part of the higher costs for new coal plants is due to high financial lending costs because of \" the reputational damage of emissions @-@ intensive investments \" . The expense of gas fired plants is partly due to \" export market \" effects on local prices . Costs of production from coal fired plants built in \" the 1970s and 1980s \" are cheaper than renewable energy sources because of depreciation . In 2015 BNEF calculated LCOE prices per MWh energy in new powerplants ( excluding carbon costs ) : $ 85 for onshore wind ( $ 175 for offshore ) , $ 66 – 75 for coal in the Americas ( $ 82 – 105 in Europe ) , gas $ 80 – 100 . A 2014 study showed unsubsidized LCOE costs between $ 37 – 81 , depending on region .

  "Covenant theology is an interpretive framework used by Reformed theologians which was significantly developed during the seventeenth century . Under this scheme , as articulated by the Assembly , God 's dealings with men are described in terms of two covenants : the covenant of works and covenant of grace . The Westminster Confession was the first major Reformed symbol to explicitly mention the covenant of works ( sometimes called the covenant of life ) , in which God offered Adam eternal life on condition of perfect obedience . In the fall of man , Adam broke the covenant of works by eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil . To remedy this , God offered salvation apart from human initiative in what was called the covenant of grace . This covenant allowed man to enjoy eternal life despite his inability to obey God 's law perfectly . The idea of the covenant of grace was a much more common feature of orthodox Reformed theology . The Westminster divines set these two covenants against each other as the two major ways in which God deals with people .",
