  "The Australian raven 's closest relatives are the other two species of raven occurring in Australia : the little raven and forest raven . The Australian raven is also somewhat closely related to the Torresian and little crow , although not as closely related as it is to the other raven species . Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another . The genetic separation between species is small and there was a suggestion the little raven may be nested within the Australian raven , though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed . Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 showed the eastern and western subspecies of the Australian raven to form two clades , almost as genetically distinct as the forest and little raven are to each other . This led the authors to propose that the subspecies be recognised as separate species .",

However , the Baltimore Beltway was diverted to two freeways not planned to be part of it . The first was the Windlass Freeway ( MD 149 ) , a route planned to run from I @-@ 95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase , paralleling US 40 to the south . The other freeway that was incorporated into the Baltimore Beltway was the Patapsco Freeway , a short connector from the Windlass Freeway southeast to the originally @-@ planned Baltimore Beltway . Only the segment of the Windlass Freeway between MD 702 the planned intersection with the Patapsco Freeway south to MD 151 ( North Point Boulevard ) were constructed , opening to traffic in 1973 .",
  "Neutrons can also probe atomic length scales and are used to study scattering off nuclei and electron spins and magnetization ( as neutrons themselves have spin but no charge ) . Coulomb and Mott scattering measurements can be made by using electron beams as scattering probes . Similarly , positron annihilation can be used as an indirect measurement of local electron density . Laser spectroscopy is an excellent tool for studying the microscopic properties of a medium , for example , to study forbidden transitions in media with nonlinear optical spectroscopy .",
  "The Motion Picture Association of America , then known as the Motion Pictures Producers and Distributors Association , was established in 1922 as the result of public objection to adult content in films , and a series of guidelines were established , suggesting content that should not be portrayed in films . Until the Hays Code was enforced , many animated shorts featured suggestive content , including sexual innuendo , references to alcohol and drug use , and mild profanity . In the 1933 short Bosko 's Picture Show , Bosko appears to use the word \" fuck \" , although it has also been suggested that the character is saying \" fox \" , or even \" mug \" . The Betty Boop series was known for its use of jokes that would eventually be considered taboo following the enforcement of the Hays Code , including the use of nudity . Betty Boop was initially drawn as a dog , and cast as the girlfriend of another Fleischer character , Bimbo . Betty was redesigned as a human , but the series continued to suggest a love relationship between the two that went farther than the normal relationship between humans and their pets . The short Is My Palm Read contains a scene in which Betty is shown as a child between the ages of four and five , bathing in the nude . In the 1970s , this scene was shown out of context in performances by The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo . Concert audiences were not aware that Betty was supposed to be a baby in the sequence .",

  "In The Little White Girl , Whistler can be seen to clearly move away from the realism of the French painter Gustave Courbet , who had previously been a great influence on him . The painting contrasts soft , round figures with harder geometrical shapes , using \" brushy , transparent touches and dense , vigorous strokes . \" Various artists and styles have been suggested as inspirations for The Little White Girl . The painting has been compared to the work of Ingres . Though Whistler 's painting was different from Ingres ' art in many ways , he was nevertheless an admirer of the French artist , and was inspired by his work . The fan in the model 's hand and the vase on the mantelpiece are oriental elements , and expressions of the Japonisme prevalent in European art at the time . Apart from this , there are few clues for the viewer , and the picture invites a wide variety of individual interpretations . A contemporary review in the newspaper The Times commented that \" Thought and passion are under the surface of the plain features , giving them an undefinable attraction . \" Art critic Hilton Kramer sees in Whistler 's portraits a charm and a combination of craft and observational skills that his more radical landscapes lacked .",

  "After the death of Cromwell in 1658 , Monck remained aloof from the manoeuvring in London that led to the brief establishment of a regime under Richard Cromwell and the subsequent contest for power between army leaders . In 1659 he opened negotiations with Charles II and began a slow march south with his army . He then restored the English Long Parliament , which , having received assurances , voted for a restoration of the monarchy and then dissolved itself , creating a de facto restoration of the monarchy in Scotland , but without safeguards . In the event Scotland regained its system of law , parliament and kirk , but also the Lords of the Articles , bishops and a king who did not visit the country and ruled largely without reference to Parliament through a series of commissioners . These began with Middleton , now an earl and ended with the king 's brother and heir , James , Duke of York ( known in Scotland as the Duke of Albany ) . Legislation was revoked back to 1633 , removing the Covenanter gains of the Bishops ' Wars , but the discipline of kirk sessions , presbyteries and synods were renewed . Only four Covenanters were executed , the most prominent being Argyll . The reintroduction of episcopacy was a source of particular trouble in the south @-@ west of the country , an area with strong Presbyterian sympathies . Abandoning the official church , many of the people here began to attend illegal field assemblies led by excluded ministers , known as conventicles . Official attempts to suppress these led to a rising in 1679 , defeated by James , Duke of Monmouth , the King 's illegitimate son , at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge . In the early 1680s a more intense phase of persecution began , in what was later to be known in Protestant historiography as \" the Killing Time \" , with dissenters summarily executed by the dragoons of James Graham , Laird of Claverhouse or sentenced to transportation or death by Sir George Mackenzie , the Lord Advocate . In England , the Exclusion crisis of 1678 – 81 divided political society into Whigs ( given their name after the Scottish Whigamores ) , who attempted , unsuccessfully , to exclude the openly Catholic Duke of Albany from the succession , and the Tories , who opposed them .

These uraei are intended to ward off evil spirits and the nightmares that they were believed to cause , or other enemies of the house 's occupant . The spell says the models have \" fire in their mouths \" . Models like those in the spells have been found in the remains of ancient Egyptian towns , and they include bowls in front of their mouths where fuel could be burnt , although the known examples do not show signs of burning .

  "Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background . This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden , who , in his emphasis on sculptural figures , utilised very shallow pictorial spaces . In his 1462 Portrait of a Man , Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape , while in the 16th century , the full @-@ length portrait became popular in the north . The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art , although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries , most usually in fresco and illuminated manuscripts . Full @-@ length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society , and were associated with princely displays of power . Of the second generation of northern painters , Hans Memling became the leading portraitist , taking commissions from as far as Italy . He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring Leonardo 's positioning of the Mona Lisa in front of a landscape view . Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist Jean Fouquet and the Germans Hans Pleydenwurff and Martin Schongauer among others .",

She soon recovered , only to suffer another attack the next year ; the death of the only one of her three children she cared for , Grand Prince Ferdinando , contributed to the second attack of apoplexy , which briefly paralysed her eyes and made speech difficult .

  "The steppe societies of Inner Asia , whose climate favoured a pastoral economy , stood in stark contrast to the Chinese mode of development . As animal herds are migratory by nature , communities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as nomads . According to the influential Mongolist Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic model . As the steppe population grew , pastoral agriculture alone could not support the population , and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards . For these needs , the nomads had to turn to the settled societies to get grains , metal tools , and luxury goods , which they could not produce by themselves . If denied trade by the settled peoples , the nomads would resort to raiding or even conquest .",

  "During the Edo period , Inari worship spread across Japan ; it became especially prominent in Edo . Smyers attributes this spread to the movement of daimyo ( feudal lords ) . Inari had by the sixteenth century become the patron of blacksmiths and the protector of warriors — for this reason , many castle compounds in Japan contain Inari shrines — and the daimyo took their belief in their protector kami with them when they relocated to a new domain . Inari 's divine role continued to expand ; on the coast , they became a protector of fishermen ; in Edo , they were invoked to prevent fires . They became the patron of actors and of prostitutes , since their shrines were often found near the pleasure quarters where these individuals lived .

  "The use of the vaccine has been controversial . In 1998 , Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues published a fraudulent research paper and he claimed to link the MMR vaccine with autism . The study was widely reported and fed concern about the safety of vaccinations . Wakefield 's research was identified as fraudulent and in 2010 , he was struck off the UK medical register and can no longer practise medicine in the UK . In the wake of the controversy , the MMR vaccination rate in the UK fell from 92 per cent in 1995 , to less than 80 per cent in 2003 . Cases of measles rose from 56 in 1998 to 1370 in 2008 , and similar increases occurred throughout Europe . In April 2013 , an epidemic of measles in Wales in the UK broke out , which mainly affected teenagers who had not been vaccinated .

  "Scutes from the postcranial region of the skeleton are also known from struthiosaurines . Cervical bands have been found on S. austriacus , as well as S. sp .. The cervical bands are preserved as a groups of two or three osteoderms that are fused with a large neural spine on the medial edge , and attached to each other through small ovular scutes with short rounded peaks . The scute attaching to the neural spine has a round ridge with a shallow depression ovular in shape . One band was preserved with a primary osteoderm that was angled across the neck from side @-@ to @-@ side and was as long as the whole band itself . The base of the scute is rounded and ends with a tapered point , and the upper side of the scute has a smooth , lightly arching shape .

In 1995 , Pereda @-@ Suberbiola et al. suggested that in a more traditional placement , the bands would have been horizontal along the body , with the neural spine in the middle of the back . That positioning would mean that the medial scute would be next to another osteoderm of equal size , and together they would either fuse , like in Edmontonia , or touch , as in Sauropelta . Another possibility , suggested by Ford , was that the bands were along the side of the neck , pointing dorsally . If oriented along the side , the primary scutes would have pointed up and down , like in polacanthids , and the medial scutes would , by definition , become secondary osteoderms . The set of medial scutes ( or secondary ) would be possibly oval in shape .",

  "The Siege of Dubrovnik ( Croatian : Opsada Dubrovnika , Serbian Latin : Blokada Dubrovnika ) was a military engagement fought between the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) and Croatian forces defending the city of Dubrovnik and its surroundings during the Croatian War of Independence . The JNA started its advance on 1 October 1991 and by late October had captured virtually all of the territory between the Pelješac and Prevlaka peninsulas on the coast of the Adriatic Sea — except for Dubrovnik itself . The JNA attacks and bombardment of Dubrovnik , including the Old Town — a UNESCO World Heritage Site — culminated on 6 December 1991 .

According to the Encyclopedia of African American Music ( 2010 ) , \" some tracks are based more in hip hop soul than neo soul , but the record is filled with live musicians and layered harmonies , and therefore it is a trendsetting record that connects modern hip hop , R & B , and classic soul music together , creating groundwork for what followed it in the neo soul genre . \" On its fifteenth anniversary , American rapper Nas reviewed the album for XXL giving it the publication 's highest rating . He viewed it as a model for artists of all genres to follow and \" a timeless record , pure music ...

  "Sutcliffe argued that between circa 1967 and 1974 , the \" emblem \" of the \" New Age \" came to be passed from the \" subcultural pioneers \" of alternative spirituality groups such as that at Findhorn to the wider array of \" countercultural baby boomers \" , and that as that happened , there was a \" fundamental transformation in meaning \" of the term \" New Age \" ; whereas it had once referred specifically to a coming era , at this point it came to be used in a wider sense to refer to a variety of humanistic activities and practices . The counterculture of the 1960s had rapidly declined by the start of the 1970s , in large part due to the collapse of the commune movement , but it would be many former members of the counter @-@ culture and hippy subculture who subsequently became early adherents of the New Age movement . The exact origins of the New Age movement remain an issue of debate ; Melton asserted that it emerged in the early 1970s , whereas Hanegraaff instead traced its emergence to the latter 1970s , adding that it then entered its full development in the 1980s . This early form of the movement was based largely in Britain and exhibited a strong influence from Theosophy and Anthroposophy . Hanegraaff termed this early core of the movement the New Age sensu stricto , or \" New Age in the strict sense \" .",

  "Drakengard 3 was conceived when Takamasa Shiba and Taro Yoko , the respective producer and director of the original game , met up years after Cavia , the company where they created the series , was absorbed into AQ Interactive . The two resurrected early plans to create a third entry in the series . As part of the brainstorming process , the company used fan questionnaires , from which the team learned that many wanted a dark story similar to Nier for the next entry in the series . Speaking about the creation of the game , Shiba said that Drakengard 3 was made partly because the company was making fewer single @-@ player RPG console games and he wished to capture the atmosphere of earlier days .

Shiba noted that the company was \" just really good at creating action games \" , which would enable the team to address criticisms laid at the previous games in the series for their poor combat while still being able to craft a story true to the Drakengard series . By the time the game was unveiled in early 2013 , it was 60 % complete , and Yoko commented \" It 's not Drakengard or Nier . If you 're expecting that , you 'll be disappointed . \"",

  "The paper used for the Grolier Codex appears to be authentic pre @-@ Columbian bark paper and the contents of the document have not been copied directly from any of the generally accepted Maya codices , although they do resemble pages 46 to 50 of the Dresden Codex .

The analysis revealed that only pre @-@ Columbian materials had been used in its creation ; no modern inorganic materials were detected . Some inconsistencies were revealed however ; cuts along the page edges seem to have been made with a sharp blade in order to give the appearance of natural wear and tear and the supposed water staining did not permeate the paper .

In conclusion the researchers were unable to support or refute the pre @-@ Columbian nature of the codex . Unusually for a document that supposedly was stored in a cave for centuries , the paint of the codex still appears fresh .",

Overnight on June 5 , the city of San Rafael , Honduras recorded about 30 in ( 760 mm ) of precipitation , possibly in relation to a localized cloudburst . The extreme rainfall flooded the entire city and left most of it covered with about 3 ft ( 1 m ) of mud . Most of San Rafael was destroyed , and there were at 73 deaths in the city ; one news report indicated that 75 people died in the city . Many rivers in Honduras became swollen at the height of the storm . On Swan Island , offshore northern Honduras , the storm dropped 14 @.@ 28 in ( 363 mm ) of rain . There was little damage on the island .",
  "According to the 2011 census , Kerala has the highest literacy rate ( 93 @.@ 91 ) among Indian states . The life expectancy in Kerala is 74 years , among the highest in India as of 2011 . Kerala 's rural poverty rate fell from 59 % ( 1973 – 1974 ) to 12 % ( 1999 – 2010 ) ; the overall ( urban and rural ) rate fell 47 % between the 1970s and 2000s against the 29 % fall in overall poverty rate in India . By 1999 – 2000 , the rural and urban poverty rates dropped to 10 @.@ 0 % and 9 @.@ 6 % respectively . These changes stem largely from efforts begun in the late 19th century by the kingdoms of Cochin and Travancore to boost social welfare . This focus was maintained by Kerala 's post @-@ independence government .",

It now largely uses human structures such as bridges and houses . Unlike the barn swallow , it uses the outside of inhabited buildings , rather than the inside of barns or stables . The nests are built at the junction of a vertical surface and an overhang , such as on house eaves , so that they may be strengthened by attachment to both planes .",
  "Following the first leg , Shankly was adamant that Liverpool would still progress : \" This tie is by no means over yet . We will win easily . We will smash in at least seven goals . This was ridiculous . Ajax played defensive football on their own ground . We never play well against defensive teams . \" Such was the shock at the result that Shankly 's claim was taken seriously . The defeat convinced Shankly that adopting Ajax 's patient , passing style was the key to success in Europe . The defeat is still Liverpool 's record defeat in European competition . Michels was worried that Liverpool might adopt aggressive tactics in the second leg : \" Our fear is that Liverpool may try to eliminate us through rough play . They showed some of this rough play in the first leg and they will play even harder in front of their own supporters \" . He also admitted that his side had some luck in the first leg but was adamant they would progress : \" There are not many great players in this Liverpool side , but they are all fighters . I agree we had some luck in Amsterdam , but I am sure we will go through . \"",

  "\" The Boy Who Knew Too Much \" was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Jeffrey Lynch . Executive producer David Mirkin \" loved \" that the whole situation of Bart seeing the waiter injure himself and not telling the truth ties together with the Homer plot in that it causes Homer to get jury duty and then only caring about going to the hotel . Mirkin thought it \" worked really well \" . The new character Freddy was voiced by The Simpsons cast member Dan Castellaneta , who also provides the voice of Mayor Quimby . Freddy was given the same type of cheekbones and nose as Quimby to make them resemble each other . When Bart is fleeing from Skinner , a shot of Bart running down a hill from the season four episode \" Kamp Krusty \" was re @-@ used . At the release of season five on DVD , a review described the image as possibly the \" best the series has ever looked on DVD \" . However , \" The Boy Who Knew Too Much \" was one of the few episodes in which technical issues still remained ; for example , Bart and Lisa 's image was fuzzy toward the beginning , and the episode featured for the last time \" some of the hand drawn dimensions that would be eliminated once the show switched over to digital compositing and desktop cartoon creation \" .",
  "In 1946 , a major new Broadway revival was produced by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II at the show 's original home , the Ziegfeld Theatre .

  "St. John 's economy is connected to both its role as the provincial capital of Newfoundland and Labrador and to the ocean . The civil service which is supported by the federal , provincial and municipal governments has been the key to the expansion of the city 's labour force and to the stability of its economy , which supports a sizable retail , service and business sector . The provincial government is the largest employer in the city , followed by Memorial University . With the collapse of the fishing industry in Newfoundland and Labrador in the 1990s , the role of the ocean is now tied to what lies beneath it – oil and gas – as opposed to what swims in or travels across it . The city is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Eastern Canada and is one of 19 World Energy Cities . ExxonMobil Canada is headquartered in St. John 's and companies such as Chevron , Husky Energy , Suncor Energy and Statoil have major regional operations in the city . Three major offshore oil developments , Hibernia , Terra Nova and White Rose , are in production off the coast of the city and a fourth development , Hebron , is expected to be producing oil by 2017 .",

  "In 1949 , four hornless lambs were sired from a Horned Dorset on a farm at North Carolina State University in Raleigh , North Carolina . Over the next five years , as part of their normal breeding program , those four ewes and the other ewes on the farm were bred to the Horned Dorset . Eventually , a ewe gave birth to twin rams . NCSU 401 was a regular horned Dorset , but his brother , \" NCSU 402 \" , was born polled , without horns , due to a genetic mutation . Thus , the Polled Dorset was born . NCSU 402 was the official name given to the first true Polled Dorset sheep . It was named in accordance with the naming system that has been used at the NCSU Small Ruminant Unit since it started its breeding program .",
  "In March 2011 , Obama detailed Biden to lead negotiations between both houses of Congress and the White House in resolving federal spending levels for the rest of the year and avoid a government shutdown . By May 2011 , a \" Biden panel \" with six congressional members was trying to reach a bipartisan deal on raising the U.S. debt ceiling as part of an overall deficit reduction plan . The U.S. debt ceiling crisis developed over the next couple of months , but it was again Biden 's relationship with McConnell that proved to be a key factor in breaking a deadlock and finally bringing about a bipartisan deal to resolve it , in the form of the Budget Control Act of 2011 , signed on August 2 , 2011 , the same day that an unprecedented U.S. default had loomed . Biden had spent the most time bargaining with Congress on the debt question of anyone in the administration , and one Republican staffer said , \" Biden 's the only guy with real negotiating authority , and [ McConnell ] knows that his word is good .

  "The British Official Historian , Stanley Kirby , wrote that the best @-@ trained and most @-@ experienced British division had been broken up to reinforce Special Force , which eventually absorbed one @-@ sixth of the infantry in South East Asia Command . He judged that had the division been retained , it could have reinforced the Fourteenth Army , making the defence of Imphal and Kohima in 1944 easier . Historian F. W. Perry wrote , \" it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the results achieved by the force did not represent an adequate return for the resources invested \" . He further argued that the force was too lightly armed to capture strongly held positions or to hold one if captured , and concluded that Special Force \" inflicted more damage and disruption on the British Army than it ever did on the Japanese . \" Similarly , Slim argued in his memoirs that it had been a mistake to break up the 70th Division as it was the only British division which had been trained in jungle warfare , and that it would have been twice as effective as an experienced conventional formation than it proved to be as part of Special Force .",
  "The film gives nods to previous installments via the casting . The most obvious is the return of Stallone , Young , and Burton : the only actors to portray the same characters in all six installments . Tarver 's appearance marks the sixth time an active professional boxer has appeared in the series . Previously , Joe Frazier ( Rocky ) , Pedro Lovell ( Rocky ) , Roberto Durán ( Rocky II ) , Tommy Morrison ( Rocky V ) , and Michael Williams ( Rocky V ) have appeared in the series . Stallone initially wanted Roy Jones , Jr. to portray Dixon , but after Jones did not return Stallone 's phone calls , he tapped Tarver to fill the role . The character of Marie appeared in the original Rocky ; she was portrayed by Jodi Letizia . For this film , Marie is portrayed by Geraldine Hughes . ( Letizia did reprise the role for Rocky V , but her scene was deleted . In that version , Marie was homeless on the streets of Philadelphia . ) Another recognizable character who appeared in the previous five films , sportscaster Stu Nahan , provided the commentary for the computer @-@ generated fight between Dixon and Balboa . Nahan was part of the ringside commentary team during all the bouts in the first three films and the Apollo Creed / Ivan Drago fight in Rocky IV ; he was then one of the members of the press , seen asking questions to Rocky upon return from Russia in Rocky V at the start of the movie , and then again towards the end with new champion Tommy Gunn . He was diagnosed with lymphoma during the Rocky Balboa filming , though , and died on December 26 , 2007 .

  "In The Musical Times Edwin Evans praised Tippett 's text : \" simple and direct ... he has wisely resisted any temptation to use quasi @-@ biblical or ' Pilgrim 's Progress ' language . \" Evans was uncertain whether the music was truly reflective of the words : \" ... the emotion seemed singularly cool under the provocations described in the text \" . Unlike Glock , Evans was unconvinced by the case for the inclusion of the spirituals : \" [ T ] he peculiar poignancy they have in their traditional form tends to evaporate in their new environment \" . Eric Blom , in Music & Letters , thought the idea of using spirituals \" brilliant \" , and the analogy with Bach 's chorales convincing . Blom was less enthusiastic about the text , which he found \" very terse and bald – rather poor , really \" — though he thought this preferable to the pomposities such as those that characterise libretti written for Handel . In his autobiography , Tippett makes only muted references to the premiere , noting that the event \" had some mixed reviews \" , but in a letter to his friend Francesca Allinson he professed himself delighted with the breadth of response to the work : \" It 's got over not only to the ordinary listeners but even to the intellectuals like [ Mátyás ] Seiber , who has written to me of some of the ' lovely texture of some of the numbers ' \" .",

She and Waugh later developed a lasting friendship . Although she was now of age , her father maintained an aggressive hostility towards most of her male friends , particularly since , as Hastings remarks , these tended towards the frivolous , the aesthetic and the effeminate . Among them was Hamish St Clair Erskine , the second son of the 5th Earl of Rosslyn , an Oxford undergraduate four years Nancy 's junior . He was , according to Hastings , the least suitable partner of all , \" the most shimmering and narcissistic of all the beautiful butterflies \" — and the one most likely to offend Lord Redesdale . The pair met in 1928 and became unofficially engaged , despite his homosexuality ( of which Nancy may not have been aware ) . Against a backdrop of negativity from family and friends — Waugh advised her to \" dress better and catch a better man \" — the affair endured sporadically for several years .",

  "Following Samuel Aba 's death , Emperor Henry entered Székesfehérvár and restored Peter . Peter introduced Bavarian law in his realm , which suggests that Hungary became an imperial fief . He accepted the Emperor 's suzerainty on Whitsun 1045 , giving his royal lance to his overlord ( who returned to Hungary ) . A number of plots to overthrow Peter indicate that he remained unpopular . Two of King Stephen I 's maternal cousins ( Bolya and Bonyha ) conspired against Peter in 1045 , but the King had them arrested , tortured and executed . Bishop Gerard of Csanád invited Vazul 's exiled sons to the country . An uprising by pagan commoners ended Peter 's second rule in 1046 .

The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , praised the episode for containing \" a memorable guest character in the French waiter Monsieur Lacosse , two great slapstick sequences involving the same , and displays Principal Skinner — pursuing Bart across the mountains like ' a non @-@ giving @-@ up school guy ' , and confessing that in some ways he 's \" a small man ; a petty , small man \" — in particularly fine form . \" DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson thought Freddy Quimby \" may well be the most unpleasant character to grace the series — in an amusing way , though Freddy ’ s edginess makes him less amusing than his uncle . It ’ s rather startling to see Skinner so rapidly resume his dislike of Bart after the last episode , though .

According to The Economist , \" In the tourist quarters of Old Havana it can seem at times as if every Cuban with a guitar has come out to sing the songs that Buena Vista made famous .

Some songs they sing have long been popular in Cuba and people have always performed them in the street . Despite the appeal of the \" Buena Vista \" ambience to tourists , Cubans themselves were less aware of the \" Buena Vista Social Club \" than international music listeners . This was due to the foreign nature of the production , and the dominance of modern Timba , Songo and other musical forms on the island , such as reggaetón by luminaries such as Raul Zeballos , the creator of the genre .

The torpedo struck the starboard side , which blew off both inboard propellers , jammed the rudder five degrees to starboard , and jammed her Number Three turret in train and elevation . A four degree list was quickly corrected by shifting ballast , but the steering problem could not be overcome and the ship was forced to steam in circles to starboard . The blast disrupted her steering column , forcing her to steer in a circle . At the end of her first circle , she fired on Japanese battleship Hiei , with her forward turrets . The Japanese ship returned fire , but all salvos passed over the cruiser . In the four six @-@ gun salvos returned by Portland , she succeeded in starting fires in the Japanese ship . At dawn , she was one of three U.S. ships still too damaged to withdraw on her own power . Then again at 06 : 30 , still circling , Portland opened fire on the abandoned hulk of Japanese destroyer Yudachi at a range of 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) . After the sixth salvo , Yudachi exploded , rolled over , and sank within five minutes . She was eventually able to correct the steering problem and withdraw on her own power . She later received a Meritorious Unit Commendation for her actions in the battle . She suffered 18 killed , 17 wounded in the battle .",

  "The situation changed dramatically with the French military expedition to Egypt in 1798 , which brought with it a corps of scholars to examine the surviving ancient monuments . The results of their study inspired a fascination with ancient Egypt throughout Europe . In the early nineteenth century , growing numbers of Europeans traveled to Egypt , both to see the ancient monuments and to collect Egyptian antiquities . Many temple artifacts , from small objects to massive obelisks , were removed by outside governments and private collectors . This wave of Egyptomania resulted in the rediscovery of temple sites such as Abu Simbel , but artifacts and even whole temples were often treated with great carelessness . The discoveries of the period did , however , make possible the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphs and the beginnings of Egyptology as a scholarly discipline .",

  "Unaware that Welburn had seated the land , the authorities declared Chincoteague Island abandoned and issued another patent for the land in December 1684 to John Clayton , who conveyed it to Colonel William Kendall of Northampton . When Welburn learned that Kendall was planning to seat the land himself , he threatened to shoot trespassers on the island . Instead , Welburn sued , and the case dragged on in the Accomack County courts until the local justices transferred it to the General Court in the capital of Williamsburg .

  "Nonetheless , many stone Norman keeps made considerable compromises to military utility . Norwich Castle , for example , included elaborate blind arcading on the outside of the building and appears to have had an entrance route designed for public ceremony , rather than for defence . The interior of the keep at Hedingham could certainly have hosted impressive ceremonies and events , but contained numerous flaws from a military perspective . Important early English and Welsh keeps such as the White Tower , Colchester , and Chepstow were all built in a distinctive Romanesque style , often reusing Roman materials and sites , and were almost certainly intended to impress and generate a political effect amongst local people . The political value of these keep designs , and the social prestige they lent to their builders , may help explain why they continued to be built in England into the late 12th century , beyond the point when military theory would have suggested that alternative designs were adopted .",

  "Although clepsydrae were more useful than sundials — they could be used indoors , during the night , and also when the sky was cloudy — they were not as accurate ; the Greeks , therefore , sought a way to improve their water clocks . Although still not as accurate as sundials , Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325 BCE , and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand , making the reading of the clock more precise and convenient . One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure : when the container holding the water was full , the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly . This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100 BCE , and improvements continued to be made in the following centuries . To counteract the increased water flow , the clock 's water containers — usually bowls or jugs — were given a conical shape ; positioned with the wide end up , a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone . Along with this improvement , clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period , with hours marked by gongs , doors opening to miniature figurines , bells , or moving mechanisms . There were some remaining problems , however , which were never solved , such as the effect of temperature . Water flows more slowly when cold , or may even freeze .",

  "There is evidence for explanations involving dietary conservatism , in which predators avoid new prey because it is an unknown quantity ; this is a long @-@ lasting effect . Dietary conservatism has been demonstrated experimentally in some species of birds . Further , birds recall and avoid objects that are both conspicuous and foul @-@ tasting longer than objects that are equally foul @-@ tasting but cryptically coloured . This suggests that Wallace 's original view , that warning colouration helped to teach predators to avoid prey thus coloured , was correct . However , some birds ( inexperienced starlings and domestic chicks ) also innately avoid conspicuously coloured objects , as demonstrated using mealworms painted yellow and black to resemble wasps , with dull green controls . This implies that warning colouration works at least in part by stimulating the evolution of predators to encode the meaning of the warning signal , rather than by requiring each new generation to learn the signal 's meaning . All of these results contradict the idea that novel , brightly coloured individuals would be more likely to be eaten or attacked by predators .",

  "In the 1580s , when China was ruled by the Ming dynasty ( 1368 – 1644 ) , a number of Jurchen tribes lived northeast of Ming territory in the region that is now known as China 's Northeast , or \" Manchuria . \" In a series of campaigns from the 1580s to the 1610s , Nurhaci ( 1559 – 1626 ) , the leader of the Jianzhou Jurchens , unified most Jurchen tribes under his rule . One of his most important reforms was to integrate Jurchen clans under flags of four different colors — yellow , white , red , and blue — each further subdivided into two to form an encompassing social and military system known as the Eight Banners . Nurhaci gave control of these Banners to his sons and grandsons . Around 1612 , Nurhaci renamed his clan Aisin Gioro ( \" golden Gioro \" ) , both to distinguish his family from other Gioro lines and to allude to an earlier dynasty that had been founded by Jurchens , the Jin ( \" golden \" ) dynasty that had ruled northern China from 1115 to 1234 . In 1616 Nurhaci formally announced the foundation of the \" Later Jin \" dynasty , effectively declaring his independence from the Ming . Over the next few years he wrested most major cities in Liaodong from Ming control . His string of victories ended in February 1626 at the siege of Ningyuan , where Ming commander Yuan Chonghuan defeated him with the help of recently acquired Portuguese cannon . Probably hurt during the battle , Nurhaci died a few months later .",
  "Since then , many scholars have operated under the belief that the Great Wall continually defended China 's border against the steppe nomads for two thousand years . For example , the 18th @-@ century sinologist Joseph de Guignes assigned macrohistorical importance to such walls when he advanced the theory that the Qin construction forced the Xiongnu to migrate west to Europe and , becoming known as the Huns , ultimately contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire . Some have attempted to make general statements regarding Chinese society and foreign policy based on the conception of a perennial Great Wall : Karl Marx took the Wall to represent the stagnation of the Chinese society and economy , Owen Lattimore supposed that the Great Wall demonstrated a need to divide the nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China , and John K. Fairbank posited that the Wall played a part in upholding the Sinocentric world order .",

  "In 1625 , James VI died and was succeeded by his son Charles I. Although born in Scotland , Charles had become estranged from his northern kingdom , with his first visit being for his Scottish coronation in 1633 , when he was crowned in St Giles Cathedral , Edinburgh with full Anglican rites . Charles had relatively few important Scots in his circle and relied heavily in Scottish matters on the generally mistrusted and often indecisive James Hamilton , 1st Duke of Hamilton and the bishops , particularly John Spottiswood , Archbishop of St. Andrews , eventually making him chancellor . At the beginning of his reign , Charles ' revocation of alienated lands since 1542 helped secure the finances of the kirk , but it threatened the holdings of the nobility who had gained from the Reformation settlement . His pushing through of legislation and refusal to hear ( or legal pursuit of ) those raising objections , created further resentment among the nobility . In England his religious policies caused similar resentment and he ruled without calling a parliament from 1629 .",

  "Two minor controversies marked Beshear 's tenure as attorney general . The first came in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court 's ruling in the 1980 case of Stone v. Graham . The ruling struck down the state law requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in all of the state 's classrooms on grounds that it violated the Establishment Clause of the federal constitution . State Superintendent Raymond Barber asked the Supreme Court to clarify whether its ruling meant that all of the copies of the Commandments already posted had to be taken down or whether it simply invalidated the Kentucky requirement for them to be posted ; the Court refused the request for clarification . Beshear then issued an advisory opinion that displaying the Commandments in classrooms under any circumstances was banned by the Court 's ruling .",

  "The chemical structure of proteins was still under debate at that time . The most accepted ( and ultimately correct ) hypothesis was that proteins are linear polypeptides , i.e. , unbranched polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds . However , a typical protein is remarkably long — hundreds of amino @-@ acid residues — and several distinguished scientists were unsure whether such long , linear macromolecules could be stable in solution . Further doubts about the polypeptide nature of proteins arose because some enzymes were observed to cleave proteins but not peptides , whereas other enzymes cleave peptides but not folded proteins . Attempts to synthesize proteins in the test tube were unsuccessful , mainly due to the chirality of amino acids ; naturally occurring proteins are composed of only left @-@ handed amino acids . Hence , alternative chemical models of proteins were considered , such as the diketopiperazine hypothesis of Emil Abderhalden . However , no alternative model had yet explained why proteins yield only amino acids and peptides upon hydrolysis and proteolysis . As clarified by Linderstrøm @-@ Lang , these proteolysis data showed that denatured proteins were polypeptides , but no data had yet been obtained about the structure of folded proteins ; thus , denaturation could involve a chemical change that converted folded proteins into polypeptides .",

Rowley too was active , commanding the successful Invasion of Île Bonaparte in July and renaming the island Île Bourbon , basing his squadron at Saint Paul on the island 's eastern shore . From this base , Rowley 's ships were ideally positioned to begin a close blockade of Isle de France , led initially by Captain Samuel Pym in HMS Sirius .

The island was captured , but when a French squadron broke through the British blockade and took shelter in Grand Port , Pym resolved to attack them . The ensuing Battle of Grand Port was a disaster for Rowley 's squadron , as Pym led four of Rowley 's five frigates into the bay without adequately assessing the channel through the coral reefs that sheltered the harbour .

  "It should be emphasized , however , that for Whitehead God is not necessarily tied to religion . Rather than springing primarily from religious faith , Whitehead saw God as necessary for his metaphysical system . His system required that an order exist among possibilities , an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities . Whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of God . However , Whitehead was also interested in religious experience . This led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of God , the consequent nature .

Alex Alemi 's and David Stevenson 's 2006 study of models of the early Solar System at the California Institute of Technology shows Venus likely had at least one moon created by a huge impact event billions of years ago . About 10 million years later , according to the study , another impact reversed the planet 's spin direction and caused the Venusian moon gradually to spiral inward until it collided with Venus . If later impacts created moons , these were removed in the same way . An alternative explanation for the lack of satellites is the effect of strong solar tides , which can destabilize large satellites orbiting the inner terrestrial planets .",

  "Innovations continued , notably the German invention of the mortar , a thick @-@ walled , short @-@ barrelled gun that blasted shot upward at a steep angle . Mortars were useful for sieges , as they could hit targets behind walls or other defences . This cannon found more use with the Dutch , who learned to shoot bombs filled with powder from them .

This often resulted in the fuse being blown into the bomb , causing it to blow up as it left the mortar . Because of this , \" double firing \" was tried where the gunner lit the fuse and then the touch hole .

  "Following completion of the game , the player finds additional texts that expand the story . The ending of the game is purposely ambiguous , and has been subject to multiple interpretations . One theory , based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb — \" Now we are all sons of bitches \" — is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development . Some also refer to the name of the game as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time , demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game . Journalists have considered Braid 's plot to be interwoven with the game itself , much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work 's construction . In this sense , some have considered the game to carry a simple credo , such as \" You must look back to go forwards \" as suggested by Eurogamer 's Dan Whitehead . Others have likened Braid to punk rock , designed ( as explicitly stated by Blow ) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry ; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts , such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros. , and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design . Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story ; he \" would not be capable \" of explaining the whole story of the game in words , and said that the central idea is \" something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly . \" Blow considered Braid to be \" about the journey , not the destination \" .

  "Primaries are connected to the manus ( the bird 's \" hand \" , composed of carpometacarpus and phalanges ) ; these are the longest and narrowest of the remiges ( particularly those attached to the phalanges ) , and they can be individually rotated . These feathers are especially important for flapping flight , as they are the principal source of thrust , moving the bird forward through the air . Most thrust is generated on the downstroke of flapping flight . However , on the upstroke ( when the bird often draws its wing in close to its body ) , the primaries are separated and rotated , reducing air resistance while still helping to provide some thrust . The flexibility of the remiges on the wingtips of large soaring birds also allows for the spreading of those feathers , which helps to reduce the creation of wingtip vortices , thereby reducing drag . The barbules on these feathers , friction barbules , are specialized with large lobular barbicels that help grip and prevent slippage of overlying feathers and are present in most of the flying birds .",
  "Because of the unusual success of the operas , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company were able , from the start , to license the works to other professional companies , such as the J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company , and to amateur troupes . For almost a century , until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961 , and even afterwards , the D 'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide , creating a \" performing tradition \" for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors , both amateur and professional . Indeed , Gilbert , Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre . Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that , prior to the creation of the Savoy operas , amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals . After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas , professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups \" support the culture of music and the drama . They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage , and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present @-@ day favourites . \" Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to \" the popularity of , and infectious craze for performing , the Gilbert and Sullivan operas \" . The National Operatic and Dramatic Association ( NODA ) was founded in 1899 . It reported , in 1914 , that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year , constituting most of the amateur companies in the country ( this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA ) . The association further reported that almost 1 @,@ 000 performances of the Savoy operas had been given in Britain that year , many of them to benefit charities . Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand . In the U.S. , and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced , both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century – the Internet Broadway Database counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960 . The Savoy Company , an amateur group formed in 1901 in Philadelphia , continues to perform today .",

Much of Easy Rider 's significance owes to the fact that it was produced for a respectable , if still modest , budget and released by a major studio .

In carrying out his principles of strict construction he was most in accord with Southerners , who generally had the letter of the law on their side . He failed utterly to realize the depth and the sincerity of Northern feeling against the South and was bewildered at the general flouting of the law and the Constitution , as he described it , by the people of his own New England . At no time did he catch the popular imagination . His inability to cope with the difficult problems that arose early in his administration caused him to lose the respect of great numbers , especially in the North , and his few successes failed to restore public confidence . He was an inexperienced man , suddenly called to assume a tremendous responsibility , who honestly tried to do his best without adequate training or temperamental fitness .",

The DNA obtained from the Oxford specimen is degraded , and no usable DNA has been extracted from subfossil remains , so the age of the groups divergence from other pigeons still needs to be independently verified .

  "Saint Vincent 's colonial government and defences were in some disarray . Governor Valentine Morris had assumed office in 1776 when the isle was granted a separate government , and reported then that it had virtually no defences . In addition to the difficult relations with the Caribs , the British population was also sympathetic to the cause of colonial independence . The French capture of Dominica in 1778 had raised constitutional questions surrounding the imposition of martial law , and the colonial assembly had consequently refused to appropriate funds for improving the island defences . Governor Morris had spent his own funds instead on improvements , contributing to financial difficulties he would run into later .",

  "Lindwall hit out , scoring 77 in an innings marked by powerful driving and pulling , dominating stands of 48 and 55 with Johnston and Toshack respectively . He particularly liked to use his feet to get to the ball on the half @-@ volley so he could hit lofted drives . Of the 103 added for the last two wickets , Johnston and Toshack managed only 25 between them . Johnston accompanied Lindwall for 80 minutes , before Toshack lasted the last 50 minutes until stumps , with Johnston as his runner . Australia were 457 / 9 at stumps , with Lindwall on 76 and Toshack on 12 . During Lindwall 's partnership with Johnston , Yardley bowled himself for over an hour , failing to bring on a frontline bowler in his stead despite being unable to dislodge the batsmen . Lindwall farmed the strike by trying to hit boundaries and twos during the over , but Yardley did not resort to the tactic of setting a deep field to yield a single to Lindwall to get the tailenders on strike . Despite Toshack and Johnston 's lack of familiarity with having and acting as a runner respectively , and the resulting disorders in running between the wickets , Lindwall was able to manipulate the strike so he faced most of the balls . Lindwall 's partners were able to survive against the English pacemen , leading O 'Reilly to lament the absence of leg spinner Doug Wright , whose guile and flight was held in high regard by the Australians . O 'Reilly thought Yardley may have bowled himself in an attempt to contain the Australians rather than dismiss them before the close of play , so his openers would not have to bat for a short period before stumps when the visitors ' attack could have made inroads . However , Yardley was neither able to contain nor dismiss the Australian tail .",

  "By the end of the 1927 English cricket season , Yorkshire had had a succession of short @-@ term captains . Generally , these men were neither sufficiently good players nor leaders to merit a position in the team , but Yorkshire 's side was strong enough to include them in the interest of maintaining amateur leadership . Tactically , Yorkshire 's success came not from the captain but from the influence of leading professionals Wilfred Rhodes and Emmott Robinson . The captain 's primary role was the enforcement of discipline : maintaining an amicable attitude within the team during games and ensuring that umpires and opponents were respected . In the early 1920s , Yorkshire had been undisciplined on the field ; cricket correspondent Jim Kilburn wrote that they were in danger of becoming \" social outcasts \" , and E. W. Swanton commented that Yorkshire 's hostile attitude when fielding looked likely to jeopardise their relations with other teams . Matters came to a head in a match against Middlesex in 1924 at Sheffield . The crowd became very antagonistic and a Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) enquiry found that a Yorkshire player had incited the unrest . Further incidents against Surrey that season led the captain Geoffrey Wilson to resign , though he led the team to the County Championship in each of his three years in charge .

At the Battle of Alamance , Moore served as the commander of Governor Tryon 's artillery company . Moore 's orders in that engagement were to fire his cannons once Tryon had determined the Regulators would not surrender , thus signalling the beginning of the battle . During the conflict , however , the governor 's artillery functioned poorly , and the Regulators were able to gain an initial advantage by fighting in an irregular fashion .

  "In 1764 King George III had ruled in favor of New York in a dispute between New York and New Hampshire over the region that later became the state of Vermont . New York refused to recognize claims to property derived from grants by New Hampshire governor Benning Wentworth during the preceding 15 years when the territory had been governed as a de facto part of New Hampshire . Consequently , the people of the disputed territory , called the New Hampshire Grants , resisted the enforcement of New York 's laws within the Grants . Indeed , Ethan Allen 's militia called the Green Mountain Boys , noted for successes in the war against the British in 1775 , was originally formed for the purpose of resisting the colonial government of New York . In 1777 the statesmen of the Grants declared it a separate state to be called Vermont , and by early 1778 had erected a state government . During 1777 – 1785 , Vermont was repeatedly denied representation in the Continental Congress , largely because New York insisted that Vermont was legally a part of New York . Vermont took the position that because its petitions for admission to the Union were denied , it was not a part of the United States , not subject to Congress , and at liberty to negotiate separately with the British . The latter Haldimand negotiations led to some exchanges of prisoners of war . The peace treaty of 1783 that ended the war included Vermont within the boundaries of the United States .",

  "The pink whipray is valuable to ecotourism at sites in the Maldives , French Polynesia , and elsewhere ; they are attracted to visitors in large numbers by the promise of food .

However , a 2008 study of Moorea whiprays found a negative effect of ecotourism in the form of bite and impact injuries , stemming from artificially high ray density and interactions with boat traffic at the feeding sites .

The population off northern Australia , which is one of these refuges , has also been listed under Least Concern .

  "Belgium 's strategic location meant that it constituted an important supply hub for the whole German army in Northern Europe and particularly northern France . Sabotage was therefore an important duty of the resistance .

Between June and September alone , 95 railroad bridges , 285 locomotives , 1 @,@ 365 wagons and 17 tunnels were all blown up by the Belgian resistance . Telegraph lines were also cut and road bridges and canals used to transport material sabotaged . In one notable action , 600 German soldiers were killed when a railway bridge between La Gleize and Stoumont in the Ardennes was blown up by 40 members of the resistance , including the writer Herman Bodson . Indeed , more German troops were reportedly killed in Belgium in 1941 than in all of Occupied France .

  "The other meaning of the term \" channel \" in telecommunications is seen in the phrase communications channel , which is a subdivision of a transmission medium so that it can be used to send multiple streams of information simultaneously . For example , one radio station can broadcast radio waves into free space at frequencies in the neighborhood of 94 @.@ 5 MHz ( megahertz ) while another radio station can simultaneously broadcast radio waves at frequencies in the neighborhood of 96 @.@ 1 MHz . Each radio station would transmit radio waves over a frequency bandwidth of about 180 kHz ( kilohertz ) , centered at frequencies such as the above , which are called the \" carrier frequencies \" . Each station in this example is separated from its adjacent stations by 200 kHz , and the difference between 200 kHz and 180 kHz ( 20 kHz ) is an engineering allowance for the imperfections in the communication system .",

  "While the concept of ships protected by armor existed before the advent of the ironclad Monitor , the need for iron plating on ships only arose after the shell @-@ firing cannon was introduced to naval warfare in the 1820s . The use of heavy iron plating on the sides of warships was not practical until steam propulsion matured enough to carry its great weight . Developments in gun technology had progressed by the 1840s so that no practical thickness of wood could withstand the power of a shell . In response , the United States began construction in 1854 of a steam @-@ powered ironclad warship , the Stevens Battery , but work was delayed and the designer , Robert Stevens , died in 1856 , stalling further work . Since there was no pressing need for such a ship at the time , there was little demand to continue work on the unfinished vessel . It was France that introduced the first operational armored ships as well as the first shell guns and rifled cannons . Experience during the Crimean War of 1854 – 55 showed that armored ships could withstand repeated hits without significant damage when French ironclad floating batteries defeated Russian coastal fortifications during the Battle of Kinburn . Ericsson claimed to have sent the French Emperor Napoléon III a proposal for a monitor @-@ type design , with a gun turret , in September 1854 , but no record of any such submission could be found in the archives of the French Ministry of the Navy ( Ministre de la Marine ) when they were searched by naval historian James Phinney Baxter III .

  "Fourier series are used to solve boundary value problems in partial differential equations . In 1822 , Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation . A discrete version of the Fourier series can be used in sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points . In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points . The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform ( DFT ) of the given sample sequence . The DFT is one of the key tools of digital signal processing , a field whose applications include radar , speech encoding , image compression . The JPEG image format is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform .",

  "Karina was located to the south of a weakening mid @-@ level ridge , leading to a relatively slow west @-@ northwest movement at 9 mph ( 15 km / h ) . Upon becoming a tropical storm , Karina reached its peak with winds of 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . There was uncertainty as to the intensity of the storm , as the Dvorak technique — a system used to estimate the intensity of a tropical cyclone — rendered an intensity of 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) ; but because the center of the storm had just moved under the deep convection , the winds were held at minimal tropical storm intensity . That night , 12 hours after being declared a tropical storm , Karina was downgraded to a tropical depression . Strong easterly wind shear of at least 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) tore away the deep convection that previously surrounded Karina . Karina was moving into a stable environment over cooling waters which would prevent convection from redeveloping , despite a forecast of lessening wind shear . The forward motion gradually decreased . By the morning of September 3 , convection had been sheared 125 mi ( 200 km ) from the center of circulation , leaving only a swirl of clouds . Karina degenerated into a remnant low @-@ pressure area later that morning and the NHC issued their final advisory . The remnant low quickly dissipated that afternoon .",

  "In 1975 , Stephen Hawking published a calculation which suggested that black holes are not completely black but emit a dim radiation due to quantum effects near the event horizon . At first , Hawking 's result posed a problem for theorists because it suggested that black holes destroy information .

This property is usually referred to as unitarity of time evolution . The apparent contradiction between Hawking 's calculation and the unitarity postulate of quantum mechanics came to be known as the black hole information paradox .",

  "If Mars had an Earth @-@ like orbit , its seasons would be similar to Earth 's because its axial tilt is similar to Earth 's . The comparatively large eccentricity of the Martian orbit has a significant effect . Mars is near perihelion when it is summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the north , and near aphelion when it is winter in the southern hemisphere and summer in the north . As a result , the seasons in the southern hemisphere are more extreme and the seasons in the northern are milder than would otherwise be the case . The summer temperatures in the south can be up to 30 K ( 30 ° C ; 54 ° F ) warmer than the equivalent summer temperatures in the north .",
  "The ubiquitin protein itself is 76 amino acids long and was named due to its ubiquitous nature , as it has a highly conserved sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms . The genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats , possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for the cell . It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest @-@ evolving protein identified to date . Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues to which another ubiquitin can be ligated , resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains . Chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to lysine 48 of the previous ubiquitin have a role in proteasome targeting , while other types of chains may be involved in other processes .",
  "There was some criticism , however . Crowther felt the film was too long . Scheuer , whilst mostly praising the film , felt that its biggest fault was \" overstatement \" , and that it hammered home at points long after they had been made . He singled out the galley rowing sequence , Jesus ' journey to the place of crucifixion , and nearly all the sequences involving the lepers . He also lightly criticized Charlton Heston for being more physically than emotionally compelling . John McCarten of The New Yorker was more critical of Heston , writing that he \" speaks English as if he 'd learned it from records . \" Even William Wyler later privately admitted he was disappointed with Heston 's acting . Film critic Dwight Macdonald also was largely negative . He found the film so uninvolving and lengthy that he said , \" I felt like a motorist trapped at a railroad crossing while a long freight train slowly trundles by . \" British film critic John Pym , writing for Time Out , was equally dismissive , calling the film a \" four @-@ hour Sunday school lesson \" . Many French and American film critics who believed in the auteur theory of filmmaking saw the film as confirmation of their belief that William Wyler was \" merely a commercial craftsman \" rather than a serious artist .",

Initially thought to have attained minimal hurricane status , Becky reached peak winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) , but the storm began to deteriorate shortly thereafter . The storm made landfall on the Florida Panhandle on July 22 , and rapidly weakened over land . Overall , damage was related to heavy rainfall that caused flooding in Tallahassee , Florida ; 104 families suffered flood @-@ related losses . About $ 500 @,@ 000 ( 1970 USD ) in damage was attributed to the storm . Further north , the heavy rainfall swelled rivers . Becky may have been partially responsible for spawning tornadoes that destroyed or damaged several houses .",

Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body , they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins , and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods .",

  "Another space @-@ saving innovation was the dielectric resonator , which can be used in other filter formats as well as waveguide . The first use of these in a filter was by S. B. Cohn in 1965 , using titanium dioxide as the dielectric material . Dielectric resonators used in the 1960s , however , had very poor temperature coefficients , typically 500 times worse than a mechanical resonator made of invar , which led to instability of filter parameters . Dielectric materials of the time with better temperature coefficients had too low a dielectric constant to be useful for space saving . This changed with the introduction of ceramic resonators with very low temperature coefficients in the 1970s . The first of these was from Massé and Pucel using barium tetratitanate at Raytheon in 1972 . Further improvements were reported in 1979 by Bell Labs and Murata Manufacturing .

  "The initial shock of the Spanish conquest was followed by decades of heavy exploitation of the indigenous peoples , allies and foes alike . Over the following two hundred years colonial rule gradually imposed Spanish cultural standards on the subjugated peoples . The Spanish reducciones created new nucleated settlements laid out in a grid pattern in the Spanish style , with a central plaza , a church and the town hall housing the civil government , known as the ayuntamiento . This style of settlement can still be seen in the villages and towns of the area . The civil government was either run directly by the Spanish and their descendents ( the criollos ) or was tightly controlled by them . The introduction of Catholicism was the main vehicle for cultural change , and resulted in religious syncretism . Old World cultural elements came to be thoroughly adopted by Maya groups , an example being the marimba , a musical instrument of African origin . The greatest change was the sweeping aside of the pre @-@ Columbian economic order and its replacement by European technology and livestock ; this included the introduction of iron and steel tools to replace Neolithic tools , and of cattle , pigs and chickens that largely replaced the consumption of game . New crops were also introduced ; however , sugarcane and coffee led to plantations that economically exploited native labour . Sixty per cent of the modern population of Guatemala is estimated to be Maya , concentrated in the central and western highlands . The eastern portion of the country was the object of intense Spanish migration and hispanicization . Guatemalan society is divided into a class system largely based on race , with Maya peasants and artisans at the bottom , the mixed @-@ race ladino salaried workers and bureaucrats forming the middle and lower class and above them the creole elite of pure European ancestry .

  "Some aspects of the popular view of dissection were exemplified by the final panel of William Hogarth 's The Four Stages of Cruelty , a series of engravings that depict a felon 's journey to the anatomical theatre . The chief surgeon ( John Freke ) appears as a magistrate , watching over the examination of the murderer Tom Nero 's body by the Company of Surgeons . According to author Fiona Haslam , the scene reflects a popular view that surgeons were \" on the whole , disreputable , insensitive to human suffering and prone to victimis [ ing ] people in the same way that criminals victimised their prey . \" Another popular belief alluded to by Hogarth was that surgeons were so ignorant of the respect due to their subjects , that they allowed the remains to become offal . In reality , the rough treatment exacted by body snatchers on corpses continued on the premises they delivered to . Joshua Brookes once admitted that he had kicked a corpse in a sack down a flight of stairs , while Robert Christison complained of the \" shocking indecency without any qualifying wit \" demonstrated by a male lecturer who dissected a woman .

  "A prevalent idea in the 18th and early 19th centuries was that illness was a result of the condition of the whole body . The environment and the activity of the patient thus played a large part in any treatment . The epitome of this kind of thinking was the concept of the vital force , which was supposed to govern the chemical processes within the body . This theory held that organic compounds could only be formed within living organisms , where the vital force could come into play . This belief had been known to be false ever since Friedrich Wöhler succeeded in synthesising urea from inorganic precursors in 1828 . Nevertheless , the vital force continued to be invoked to explain organic chemistry in Bird 's time . Sometime in the middle of the 19th century , a new way of thinking started to take shape , especially among younger physicians , fuelled by rapid advances in the understanding of chemistry . For the first time , it became possible to identify specific chemical reactions with specific organs of the body , and to trace their effects through the various functional relations of the organs and the exchanges between them .",

  "The Assembly was called by the Long Parliament before and during the beginning of the First English Civil War . The Long Parliament was influenced by Puritanism , a religious movement which sought to further reform the church . They were opposed to the religious policies of King Charles I and William Laud , Archbishop of Canterbury . As part of a military alliance with Scotland , Parliament agreed that the outcome of the Assembly would bring the English Church into closer conformity with the Church of Scotland . The Scottish Church was governed by a system of elected assemblies of elders called presbyterianism , rather than rule by bishops , called episcopalianism , which was used in the English church . Scottish commissioners attended and advised the Assembly as part of the agreement . Disagreements over church government caused open division in the Assembly , despite attempts to maintain unity . The party of divines who favoured presbyterianism was in the majority , but political and military realities led to greater influence for the congregationalist party . Congregationalists favoured autonomy for individual congregations rather than the subjection of congregations to regional and national assemblies entailed in presbyterianism . Parliament eventually adopted a presbyterian form of government , but it lacked the power the presbyterian divines desired .

He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs , the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief .",

  "The design of the fort was a pentagon shape that fitted conveniently into the point of the bluff above the cliff . The ditch , tunnels and underground chambers had to be cut out of solid stone and faced with masonry . Several loopholes and firing ports were fitted into the stone encasements to allow rifle fire from every aspect of the fort . In case of an attempted infantry assault , caponiers faced both landward sides of the fort , with firing positions facing each direction . This meant that the only position to safely assault the fort with infantry was up the sheer cliffs of Kangaroo Bluff . Access to the caponiers was through iron hatchways that opened into open passageways three metres deep .

The loading galleries were ingenious and allowed the guns to be muzzle loaded with shells dragged along a conveyor belt directly to the muzzle of the gun , when it was in a downward tilted position .",

  "The modern monitoring system on Mauna Loa is constituted not only by its locally seismic network but also of a large number of GPS stations , tiltmeters , and strainmeters that have been anchored on the volcano to monitor ground deformation due to swelling in Mauna Loa 's subterranean magma chamber , which presents a more complete picture of the events proceeding eruptive activity . The GPS network is the most durable and wide @-@ ranging of the three systems , while the tiltmeters provide the most sensitive predictive data , but are prone to erroneous results unrelated to actual ground deformation ; nonetheless a survey line across the caldera measured a 76 mm ( 3 in ) increase in its width over the year preceding the 1975 eruption , and a similar increase in 1984 eruption . Strainmeters , by contrast , are relatively rare . The Observatory also maintains two gas detectors at Mokuʻāweoweo , Mauna Loa 's summit caldera , as well as a publicly accessible live webcam and occasional screenings by interferometric synthetic aperture radar imaging ."
