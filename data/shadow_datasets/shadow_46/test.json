  "Maximum thickness of the Marcellus ranges from 270 m ( 890 ft ) in New Jersey , to 12 m ( 40 ft ) in Canada . In West Virginia , the Marcellus Formation is as much as 60 m ( 200 ft ) thick . In extreme eastern Pennsylvania , it is 240 m ( 790 ft ) thick , thinning to the west , becoming only 15 m ( 49 ft ) thick along the Ohio River , and only a few feet in Licking County , Ohio . The thinning , or stratigraphic convergence , from east to west is caused by decreasing grain size in the clastic deposits , which entered the basin from the east . The beds finally \" pinch out \" westward because deposition was limited by the Cincinnati Arch , the bulge that formed the west shore of the basin . Where the formation is relatively thick , it is divided into several members , and as the formation continues to thicken to the east , these members are further divided . Some workers chose to classify the Marcellus as a subgroup , and classify some of the members as separate formations .",

  "Love Kraft is the seventh studio album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals , released on 22 August 2005 through Epic Records in the United Kingdom . The album was recorded in Spain with producer Mario Caldato Jr and was something of a departure for the band , with all members contributing songs and lead vocals alongside Gruff Rhys who had been main songwriter for the Super Furries until this point . In selecting tracks for Love Kraft a conscious effort was made by the band not to choose songs on their individual merit but rather to pick those which went well together in order to create as cohesive an album as possible . The album 's name was taken from a sex shop , Love Craft , near the Cardiff offices of the Super Furries ' management team and is also a nod to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft .",

  "Tchaikovsky struggled with sonata form . Its principle of organic growth through the interplay of musical themes was alien to Russian practice . According to Brown and musicologists Hans Keller and Daniel Zhitomirsky , Tchaikovsky found his solution to large @-@ scale structure while composing the Fourth Symphony . He essentially sidestepped thematic interaction and kept sonata form only as an \" outline , \" as Zhitomirsky phrases it . Within this outline , the focus centered on periodic alternation and juxtaposition . Tchaikovsky placed blocks of dissimilar tonal and thematic material alongside one another , with what Keller calls \" new and violent contrasts \" between musical themes , keys and harmonies . This process , according to Brown and Keller , builds momentum and adds intense drama . While the result , Warrack charges , is still \" an ingenious episodic treatment of two tunes rather than a symphonic development of them \" in the Germanic sense , Brown counters that it took the listener of the period \" through a succession of often highly charged sections which added up to a radically new kind of symphonic experience \" ( italics Brown ) , one that functioned not on the basis of summation , as Austro @-@ German symphonies did , but on one of accumulation .",

  "A simple method of impedance matching is stub matching with a single stub . However , a single stub will only produce a perfect match at one particular frequency . This technique is therefore only suitable for narrow band applications . To widen the bandwidth multiple stubs may be used , and the structure then takes on the form of a stub filter . The design proceeds as if it were a filter except that a different parameter is optimised . In a frequency filter typically the parameter optimised is stopband rejection , passband attenuation , steepness of transition , or some compromise between these . In a matching network the parameter optimised is the impedance match . The function of the device does not require a restriction of bandwidth , but the designer is nevertheless forced to choose a bandwidth because of the structure of the device .",

The polar auroral emissions are similar to those observed around Earth 's poles : both appear when electrons are accelerated towards the planet by potential drops , during reconnection of solar magnetic field with that of the planet . The regions within both main ovals emit most of auroral X @-@ rays .

  "Ofcom estimates that even after extra spectrum has been allocated to DAB , around 90 local radio stations will be unable to transmit on DAB , either because there is no space for them on a local DAB multiplex , or because they cannot afford the high transmission costs of DAB that the multiplex operators are charging . Ofcom announced in 2005 that it regarded Digital Radio Mondiale ( DRM ) as an option for local stations unable to secure carriage or unable to pay the high transmission costs of DAB . One of the drawbacks of DAB has not been addressed . In simple terms the frequency of a broadcast is the carrier frequency ( i.e. a sine wave ) In order to carry any information the carrier frequency must be modulated . The signal at the receiver ( radio ) is then demodulated and the information is retrieved . The demodulators for FM signals are almost instantaneous so that one can have radios in different areas and move between those areas to hear the broadcast continuously . In contrast the demodulators for digital signals take a finite time and each digital radio takes a different time to demodulate the broadcast signal , so that if you move between different radios that are spatially apart you are likely to hear the same part of the broadcast twice or miss parts of it depending on the time to demodulate the signal of the individual radios . The other drawback with DAB is that it is all or nothing . If there is any interference or loss due to moving out of the footprint of the broadcast signal you will receive no signal , whereas in the case of FM you can hear something even if it is crackly .",

By eight weeks , the cubs make short ventures outside the den with their mother , although they do not travel with her as she roams her territory until they are older . The cubs are nursed for three to six months . Around the time they are weaned , they start to accompany their mother on territorial walks and they are taught how to hunt . The cubs often become capable ( and nearly adult size ) hunters at eleven months old . The cubs become independent around eighteen months of age , but it is not until they are around two to two and a half years old that they fully separate from their mother . Females reach sexual maturity at three to four years , whereas males do so at four to five years .",

  "In the second book , Clement provides practical rules on living a Christian life . He argues against overindulgence in food and in favour of good table manners . While prohibiting drunkenness , he promotes the drinking of alcohol in moderation following 1 Timothy 5 : 23 . Clement argues for a simple way of life in accordance with the innate simplicity of Christian monotheism . He condemns elaborate and expensive furnishings and clothing , and argues against overly passionate music and perfumes . But Clement does not believe in the abandoning of worldly pleasures and argues that the Christian should be able to express his joy in God 's creation through gaiety and partying . He opposes the wearing of garlands , because the picking of the flowers ultimately kills a beautiful creation of God , and the garland resembles the crown of thorns . Clement treats sex at some length . He argues that both promiscuity and sexual abstinence are unnatural , and that the main goal of human sexuality is procreation . Homosexuality , prostitution , concubinage , adultery and coitus with pregnant women should all be avoided as they will not act towards the generation of legitimate offspring .",

  "Although Alexander was known for his ostentatious and luxurious lifestyle , he founded a number of religious houses in his diocese and was an active builder and literary patron . He also attended church councils and reorganized his diocese by increasing the number of archdeaconries and setting up prebends to support his cathedral clergy . Under Henry 's successor , King Stephen , Alexander was caught up in the fall from favour of his family , and was imprisoned together with his uncle Roger in 1139 . He subsequently briefly supported Stephen 's rival , Matilda , but by the late 1140s Alexander was once again working with Stephen . He spent much of the late 1140s at the papal court in Rome , but died in England in early 1148 . During his episcopate he began the rebuilding of his cathedral , which had been destroyed by fire . Alexander was the patron of medieval chroniclers Henry of Huntingdon and Geoffrey of Monmouth , and also served as an ecclesiastical patron of the medieval hermit Christina of Markyate and Gilbert of Sempringham , founder of the Gilbertines .",

  "Soring can be detected by observing the horse for lameness , assessing its stance and palpating the lower legs . Some trainers trick inspectors by training horses not to react to the pain that palpation may cause , often by severely punishing the horse for flinching when the sored area is touched . The practice is sometimes called \" stewarding \" , in reference to the horse show steward . Some trainers use topical anesthetics , which are timed to wear off before the horse goes into the show ring . Pressure shoeing is also used , eliminating use of chemicals altogether . Trainers who sore their horses have been observed leaving the show grounds when they find that the more stringent federal inspection teams are present . Although illegal under federal law for over 40 years , soring is still practiced and criminal charges have been filed against people who violate the Act . Enforcement of the HPA is difficult , due to limited inspection budgets and problems with lax enforcement by inspectors who are hired by the shows they were to police . As a result , while in 1999 there were eight certified HIOs , by 2010 , only three organizations remained certified as HIOs , all known to be actively working to end soring .",

This area under the control of the Knights Templar ( and subsequently the Knights Hospitaller ) became known as Commandaria . When the knights began producing large quantities of the wine for export to Europe 's royal courts and for supplying pilgrims en route to the holy lands , the wine assumed the name of the region .

In 1911 he was elected to a fellowship at All Souls College and a year later was appointed to a history lectureship at Hertford College .",
  "In criticism , Johnson had a lasting influence , although not everyone viewed him favourably . Some , like Macaulay , regarded Johnson as an idiot savant who produced some respectable works , and others , like the Romantic poets , were completely opposed to Johnson 's views on poetry and literature , especially with regard to Milton . However , some of their contemporaries disagreed : Stendhal 's Racine et Shakespeare is based in part on Johnson 's views of Shakespeare , and Johnson influenced Jane Austen 's writing style and philosophy . Later , Johnson 's works came into favour , and Matthew Arnold , in his Six Chief Lives from Johnson 's \" Lives of the Poets \" , considered the Lives of Milton , Dryden , Pope , Addison , Swift , and Gray as \" points which stand as so many natural centres , and by returning to which we can always find our way again \" .",
  "The fourth phase of activity began one million years ago when the Cordilleran Ice Sheet retreated from the upper flanks of the adjacent lava plateau , creating Mount Edziza proper which is the most northerly of the four central volcanoes . It is a steep @-@ sided stratovolcano and the largest and highest of the peaks that form the volcanic complex with an elevation of 2 @,@ 787 metres ( 9 @,@ 144 ft ) , overlapping the northern flank of Ice Peak . The stratovolcano is made up of a fine @-@ grained volcanic rock called trachyte and is associated with several lava domes which were formed by trachyte lava flows and explosive eruptions . Its smooth northern and western flanks , only slightly channeled by erosion , curve up to a circular 2 @,@ 700 @-@ metre ( 8 @,@ 900 ft ) summit ridge which surrounds a central , ice @-@ filled caldera 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) in diameter .

Piles of pillow lava and hyaloclastite , formed by subglacial eruptions , are found on the flanks of Mount Edziza and nearby Ice Peak , as well as on the surface of the surrounding shield volcano . Pillow Ridge on Edziza 's northwest flank was formed when basaltic lava erupted beneath the regional Cordilleran Ice Sheet when it was close to its greatest thickness .",
  "The military settlers ( of Thanjavur ) included both Brahmins and Marathas , and by reason of their isolation from their distant home , the sub @-@ divisions which separated these castes in their mother @-@ country were forgotten , and they were all welded together under the common name of Deshasthas . The Brahmin migrants and the Maratha migrants both call themselves \" Deshasthas \" as both groups migrated to Tanjore from the Desh region of Maharashtra , but till today maintain their separate identities , despite the common \" Deshastha \" tag . Today 's Marathi speaking Thanjavur population are descendants of the Marathi speaking immigrants who immigrated to Tamil Nadu in the 17th and 18th centuries . The isolation from their homeland has almost made them culturally and linguistically alien to Brahmins in Maharashtra . For example , Thanjavur Marathi would sound as a strange mixture of Marathi and Tamil to a Maharashtrian in Pune and would hardly be intelligible to him . Likewise a Tanjore Maharashtrian would find it difficult to follow Pune Marathi . Tanjore Maharashtrian Brahmins who call themselves Deshasthas maintain their distinct brahminical identity which can be seen in their religious and wedding customs . Almost all their customs can be traced to the practices conducted by the early Maharashtrian settlers of Tanjore . They belong to two major groups , the Madhwa Deshastha Brahmins and Smartha Deshastha Brahmins . Arranged marriages between these two groups are common .

  "This tranquility lasted until 542 / 543 when the great plague arrived in Africa and caused many casualties , especially among members of the army . In addition , in early 543 the Moors in Byzacena became restive . Solomon executed the brother of the chieftain Antalas , whom he held responsible for the disturbances , and ceased the subsidies granted to Antalas , alienating the powerful and hitherto loyal chieftain . At the same time , Solomon 's nephew Sergius , newly named governor of Tripolitania as a token of Emperor Justinian 's gratitude ( along with his brother Cyrus in the Pentapolis ) , caused the outbreak of hostilities with the tribal confederation of the Leuathae when his men killed 80 of their leaders at a banquet . Although in a subsequent battle near Leptis Magna he was victorious , in early 544 Sergius was forced to travel to Carthage and seek his uncle 's aid . The rebellion spread quickly from Tripolitania to Byzacena , where Antalas joined it . Joined by his three nephews , Solomon marched against the Moors as they assembled , meeting them near Theveste . Last @-@ minute diplomatic overtures to the Leuathae failed , and the two armies clashed at Cillium , on the border of Numidia and Byzacena .

  "The type of current used plays an important role in arc welding . Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and gas metal arc welding generally use direct current , but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively . In welding , the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration , and as a result , changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties . If the electrode is positively charged , the base metal will be hotter , increasing weld penetration and welding speed . Alternatively , a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds . Nonconsumable electrode processes , such as gas tungsten arc welding , can use either type of direct current , as well as alternating current . However , with direct current , because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material , a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds , while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds . Alternating current rapidly moves between these two , resulting in medium @-@ penetration welds . One disadvantage of AC , the fact that the arc must be re @-@ ignited after every zero crossing , has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave , making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem .",

  "However , many important differences exist between the two men . Joel Coen said : \" Both writers wrote the same kind of plays with proletarian heroes , but their personalities were quite different . Odets was much more of an extrovert ; in fact he was quite sociable even in Hollywood , and this is not the case with Barton Fink ! \" Although he was frustrated by his declining popularity in New York , Odets was successful during his time in Hollywood . Several of his later plays were adapted – by him and others – into movies . One of these , The Big Knife ( 1955 ) , matches Barton 's life much more than Odets ' . In it , an actor becomes overwhelmed by the greed of a movie studio which hires him and eventually commits suicide . Another similarity to Odets ' work is Audrey 's death , which mirrors a scene in Deadline at Dawn ( 1946 ) , a film noir written by Odets . In that film , a character awakens to find that the woman he bedded the night before has been inexplicably murdered .",

  "The growth @-@ differentiation balance hypothesis states that plant defenses are a result of a tradeoff between \" growth @-@ related processes \" and \" differentiation @-@ related processes \" in different environments . Differentiation @-@ related processes are defined as \" processes that enhance the structure or function of existing cells ( i.e. maturation and specialization ) . \" A plant will produce chemical defenses only when energy is available from photosynthesis , and plants with the highest concentrations of secondary metabolites are the ones with an intermediate level of available resources . The GDBH also accounts for tradeoffs between growth and defense over a resource availability gradient . In situations where resources ( e.g. water and nutrients ) limit photosynthesis , carbon supply is predicted to limit both growth and defense . As resource availability increases , the requirements needed to support photosynthesis are met , allowing for accumulation of carbohydrate in tissues . As resources are not sufficient to meet the large demands of growth , these carbon compounds can instead be partitioned into the synthesis of carbon based secondary metabolites ( phenolics , tannins , etc . ) . In environments where the resource demands for growth are met , carbon is allocated to rapidly dividing meristems ( high sink strength ) at the expense of secondary metabolism . Thus rapidly growing plants are predicted to contain lower levels of secondary metabolites and vice versa . In addition , the tradeoff predicted by the GDBH may change over time , as evidenced by a recent study on Salix spp . Much support for this hypothesis is present in the literature , and some scientists consider the GDBH the most mature of the plant defense hypotheses .",

  "In 1348 a plague known as the Black Death crossed from mainland Europe into England , rapidly killing an estimated 50 per cent of the population . After an initial period of economic shock , England began to adapt to the changed economic situation . The death rate among the peasantry meant that suddenly land was relatively plentiful and manpower in much shorter supply . Labourers could charge more for their work and , in the consequent competition for labour , wages were driven sharply upwards . In turn , the profits of landowners were eroded . The trading , commercial and financial networks in the towns disintegrated .",

  "Cope was raised as a Quaker , and was taught that the Bible was literal truth . Although he never confronted his family about their religious views , Osborn writes that Cope was at least aware of the conflict between his scientific career and his religion . Osborn writes : \" If Edward harbored intellectual doubts about the literalness of the Bible ... he did not express them in his letters to his family but there can be little question ... that he shared the intellectual unrest of the period . \" Lanham writes that Cope 's religious fervor ( which seems to have subsided after his father 's death ) was embarrassing to even his devout Quaker associates . Biographer Jane Davidson believes that Osborn overstated Cope 's internal religious conflicts . She ascribes Cope 's deference to his father 's beliefs as an act of respect or a measure to retain his father 's financial support . Frazer 's reminiscences about his friend suggest Cope often told people what they wanted to hear , rather than his true views .",

  "Karl Marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the means of production in the capitalist system : the bourgeoisie own the means , but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power ( forming the material base of the cultural superstructure ) . Max Weber critiqued Marxist economic determinism , arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities , but on other status and power differentials ( e.g. patriarchy ) . According to Weber , stratification may occur among at least three complex variables : ( 1 ) Property ( class ) : A person 's economic position in a society , based on birth and individual achievement . Weber differs from Marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification . Weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own ; Marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat . ( 2 ) Prestige ( status ) : A person 's prestige , or popularity in a society . This could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth. and ( 3 ) Power ( political party ) : A person 's ability to get their way despite the resistance of others . For example , individuals in state jobs , such as an employee of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , or a member of the United States Congress , may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power Pierre Bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital . Theorists such as Ralf Dahrendorf have noted the tendency toward an enlarged middle @-@ class in modern Western societies , particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service @-@ based economies .

Bihać was a UN @-@ designated \" safe area \" , controlled by the 5th Corps of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina ( ARBiH ) , supported by the Croatian Defence Council ( HVO ) — the main military force of the Bosnian Croats . It was thought that the capture of Bihać by Serb forces would escalate the war and worsen a growing rift between the United States , France and the United Kingdom , with the U.S. and European powers advocating different approaches to preservation of the area . In addition , it was feared that Bihać would turn into the worst humanitarian disaster of the war . Furthermore , denying Bihać to the RSK or Republika Srpska was strategically important to Croatia , which was fighting the Croatian War of Independence against the RSK . The Chief of the Croatian General Staff Janko Bobetko thought that the possible fall of Bihać would represent the end of Croatia 's war effort . It was considered that if the area were captured by Serb forces , it would allow for the consolidation of the territory held by Serb forces in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina , as well as redeployment of RSK and VRS troops to reinforce other areas .",

  "FLCN creates a protein called folliculin that has two isoforms . It appears to act as a tumor suppressor and is expressed strongly in the skin , distal nephrons , and type I pneumocytes . It has also been found in the parotid gland , brain , breast , pancreas , prostate , and ovaries . Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way . Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division , leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors . Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism , possibly through modulation of the mTOR ( mammalian target of rapamycin ) pathway and / or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria . Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 ( FLCN @-@ interacting protein ) to form a complex with AMP @-@ activated protein kinase . Folliculin 's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome , Cowden syndrome , tuberous sclerosis , and Peutz @-@ Jeghers syndrome .",

  "Companies object to being blamed for shark attacks , pointing out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans . Their position is that further research needs to be done before banning practices such as chumming , which may alter natural behavior . One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway , well away from human leisure areas . Also , responsible dive operators do not feed sharks . Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal .

  "Theobald 's dealings with Henry of Blois , the Bishop of Winchester , his suffragan bishop , were strained because of Henry 's position as papal legate . Henry supported the appointment of William FitzHerbert as Archbishop of York in 1141 , which Theobald opposed . Although Theobald spoke out against the manner of election , he took little active part in the subsequent electoral disputes , which resulted eventually in the deposition of FitzHerbert and his replacement at York by Henry Murdac . But in September 1143 , Henry 's legatine powers lapsed when Pope Innocent II , who had made the legatine appointment , died . Celestine II was elected on 26 September 1143 , but he was an opponent of Stephen , and thus was not favourably inclined towards Stephen 's brother Henry either . To secure appointment as legate , Theobald travelled to Rome in December 1143 , arriving shortly before Celestine 's death on 8 March 1144 . Theobald was probably accompanied by Nigel , Bishop of Ely , and Roger de Clinton , Bishop of Coventry . Before his death , Celestine forbade Theobald \" to allow any change to be made in the position of the English crown , since the transfer of it had been justly denounced , and the matter was still under dispute \" . This became the papal policy , and was a significant change from the recognition of Stephen as king by Pope Innocent II soon after Stephen 's coronation in 1135 . It essentially forbade Theobald from crowning any successor to Stephen , especially while Stephen was still alive .",

  "Allan Girdler and Glynn Kerr nonetheless still favor the Roper , even by Cameron 's criterion . The reason , they say , is that it did in fact pioneer successful motorcycle technologies , including the twistgrip throttle control , and the frame geometry and engine placement used by the motorcycle as we know it today , while the Reitwagen was exceedingly crude , failing to employ the well understood principles of rake and trail to remain upright by movements of the front fork , and turn by leaning . Rake and trail are created by having the steering axis angled to varying degrees , rather than perfectly vertical , and by having the steering axis slightly offset , creating trail . This subtle engineering makes it possible for the rider to turn the bicycle or motorcycle by the counterintuitive , and typically unconscious , technique of countersteering , in which the handlebar is turned slightly to the left , causing the machine to lean to the right , and turning the vehicle to the right . Trail , also called fork offset , is an element contributing to the stability of bicycle and motorcycle dynamics , and the lack of it was one reason why the Reitwagen had to rely on two outrigger wheels to keep it from falling down , so it remained vertical and was steered much like a tricycle . David Burgess @-@ Wise called the Daimler @-@ Maybach test bed \" a crude makeshift \" , saying , \" as a bicycle , it was 20 years out of date . \"",

  "Italian folklore holds that porcini sprout up at the time of the new moon ; research studies have tried to investigate more scientifically the factors that influence the production of fruit bodies . Although fruit bodies may appear any time from summer to autumn ( June to November in the UK ) , their growth is known to be triggered by rainfall during warm periods of weather followed by frequent autumn rain with a drop in soil temperature . Above average rainfall may result in the rapid appearance of large numbers of boletes , in what is known in some circles as a \" bolete year \" . A 2004 field study indicated that fruit body production is enhanced by an open and sunny wood habitat , corroborating an earlier observation made in a Zimbabwean study ; removal of the litter layer on the forest floor appeared to have a negative effect on fruit body production , but previous studies reported contradictory results . A Lithuanian study conducted in 2001 concluded that the maximal daily growth rate of the cap ( about 21 mm or 0 @.@ 8 in ) occurred when the relative air humidity was the greatest , and the fruit bodies ceased growing when the air humidity dropped below 40 % .

They are not visible when the tadpole is viewed from below . The nostrils are situated about two thirds of the way between the eyes and snout . The mouth is small and located at the bottom of the tip of the snout . Small papillae are present along the sides of the upper lip and along the entire margin of the lower lip . The beaks are robust and with small serrations . The spiracle opens on the middle of the left side of the body . The tail is slender with fins that do not extend to the body . The tadpoles are predominantly pale brown in color . At the time when the legs first appear , they have a snout to vent length of roughly 25 to 27 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 to 1 @.@ 06 in ) . The tadpoles are so large and numerous that at times , there appear to be more tadpoles than water in the tree holes .",
  "This catch @-@ all category refers to other seabird strategies that involve the next trophic level up . Kleptoparasites are seabirds that make a part of their living stealing food of other seabirds . Most famously , frigatebirds and skuas engage in this behaviour , although gulls , terns and other species will steal food opportunistically . The nocturnal nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy . Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species , and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting . A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40 % of the food they needed , and on average obtained only 5 % . Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal carrion when the opportunity arises , as will giant petrels . Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging : an analysis of regurgitated squid beaks has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive , and include mid @-@ water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses . Some species will also feed on other seabirds ; for example , gulls , skuas and pelicans will often take eggs , chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies , while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups .",

  "In the winter of 1700 , a group of around 500 Ashkenazim led by Judah heHasid arrived from Europe . They were mystics who were intent on advancing the arrival of the Messianic Era by settling in Jerusalem and leading ascetic lives . A few days after their arrival in the city , heHasid died , and without a leader , their messianic hopes dissipated and the community began to disintegrate . Those who remained managed to build forty dwellings and a small synagogue in the Ashkenazic Compound . Soon after , they endeavoured to construct a larger synagogue , but the task proved expensive . They found themselves having to bribe the Ottoman authorities in order to enable them to proceed with their building project . Unexpected costs relating to the construction , financial hardships and the burden of various other taxes drained their funds . They became impoverished and were forced to take loans from local Arabs , eventually falling into severe debt . Pressure and threats from the creditors led to a meshulach ( rabbinical emissary ) being sent to abroad to solicit funds for repayment of the loans . In late 1720 , with the debts still outstanding , the Arab lenders lost patience and set the synagogue and its contents alight . The leaders of the community were imprisoned and shortly after , all the Ashkenazim were banished from the city . Over the course of time , shops were built in the courtyard and the synagogue was left desolate , in a pile of rubble . It thus became known as the \" Ruin of Rabbi Judah heHasid \" .",
  "In 1953 , fourteen standard stock motor cars were withdrawn from passenger service , and were converted to ballast motor cars , with the final one completed in early 1955 . All of the vehicles chosen had been built in 1923 , four by Cammell Laird and ten by the Metropolitan Carriage Wagon & Finance Co . At least three of them were chosen because they were at Acton Works for repairs to collision damage . They were numbered L62 to L75 , and were painted grey . In 1957 , they were all repainted in Metropolitan maroon . L72 was the first to be scrapped , after a collision in 1963 .

  "In the first images of Titan 's surface taken by Earth @-@ based telescopes in the early 2000s , large regions of dark terrain were revealed straddling Titan 's equator . Prior to the arrival of Cassini , these regions were thought to be seas of liquid hydrocarbons . Radar images captured by the Cassini spacecraft have instead revealed some of these regions to be extensive plains covered in longitudinal dunes , up to 330 ft ( 100 m ) high about a kilometer wide , and tens to hundreds of kilometers long . Dunes of this type are always aligned with average wind direction . In the case of Titan , steady zonal ( eastward ) winds combine with variable tidal winds ( approximately 0 @.@ 5 meters per second ) . The tidal winds are the result of tidal forces from Saturn on Titan 's atmosphere , which are 400 times stronger than the tidal forces of the Moon on Earth and tend to drive wind toward the equator . This wind pattern , it was theorized , causes granular material on the surface to gradually build up in long parallel dunes aligned west @-@ to @-@ east . The dunes break up around mountains , where the wind direction shifts .",

  "Roger got drawn into the controversy with Becket because Henry II wanted to have his eldest living son crowned as king during Henry 's lifetime . ( Traditionally , the ceremony is performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury ) This was a new practice for England , but was a custom of the Capetian kings of France , which Henry decided to imitate . Henry II insisted that his son , Henry be crowned at Westminster Abbey on 14 June 1170 by Archbishop Roger of York . Also present at the coronation were the bishops of London , Salisbury , Exeter , Chester , Rochester , St Aspah , Llandaff , Durham , Bayeux , Évreux and Sées . The only English bishops absent seem to have been Winchester , Norwich , Worcester , and of course Thomas Becket , Archbishop of Canterbury , who was in exile . The remaining English sees were vacant . This overstepped a long tradition which reserved coronations to the Archbishop of Canterbury , a reservation confirmed as recently as 1166 by Pope Alexander III . In 1170 , however , Henry II received papal permission to have Roger crown the younger Henry , a permission which Alexander later revoked .",

  "It is unknown exactly when chariot racing began , but it may have been as old as chariots themselves . It is known from artistic evidence on pottery that the sport existed in the Mycenaean world , but the first literary reference to a chariot race is one described by Homer , at the funeral games of Patroclus . The participants in this race were Diomedes , Eumelus , Antilochus , Menelaus , and Meriones . The race , which was one lap around the stump of a tree , was won by Diomedes , who received a slave woman and a cauldron as his prize . A chariot race also was said to be the event that founded the Olympic Games ; according to one legend , mentioned by Pindar , King Oenomaus challenged suitors for his daughter Hippodamia to a race , but was defeated by Pelops , who founded the Games in honour of his victory .",

The premiere of \" La estrella cayó en el mar \" , though marred by politics , was a success and continued playing to sold @-@ out houses . After the first presentation , a reporter from the magazine El Hogar gave rave reviews on the play and marriage of Bence to Closas . The reporter was contacted by first lady Eva Peron , who also demanded that the editor print a retraction and a public denial of what had been written .

  ".... To the continental observer , the British losses seemed to represent a big victory for the Axis , but in reality the facts were quite different , since it had not been possible to prevent a British force , among which were five merchant vessels , from reaching Valetta .... Thanks to these new supplies Malta was now capable of fighting for several weeks , or , at a pinch , for several months . The main issue , the danger of air attack on the supply route to North Africa , remained . To achieve this objective no price was too high , and from this point of view the British operation , in spite of all the losses , was not a defeat , but a strategical failure of the first order by the Axis , the repercussions of which will one day be felt ...",

  "Tamil works transform the terrible Kapali form of Shiva to a more lovable form . South Indian devotional literature portrays Bhikshatana in the Deodar Forest of the sages , but the Tevaram by the Nayanar poet @-@ saints also describes rural women following him and calling out to him . Several poet @-@ saints describe the sensuous nature of Bhikshatana and the love @-@ sick emotions of the women who came to give him alms . However , the references to Shiva seeking alms had reduced to only three or four by the time of Manikkavacakar ( 9th century AD ) . The poems of Campantar , Appar , and Cuntarar focus on two forms of Shiva : Nataraja and Bhikshatana . The 7th @-@ century Nayanar saint Campantar mentions that Bhikshatana wanders from door to door asking for alms with the beggar 's call \" Ladies , give me alms \" and places his verses on the lips of women , who become enamoured of Bhikshatana . In a verse , Campantar rhetorically asks why the giver of all things and one who ends all troubles of devotees — Shiva — is wandering begging for food with a disgusting white skull . In another verse a woman comments on his strange appearance and describes how she is frightened by the serpent that wraps around his body when she approaches to give him alms . Another 7th @-@ century Nayanar saint , Appar , talks about the handsome beggar Shiva , seducer of married women . He speaks of women allured by Bhikshatana 's speech and his glance . The women tell that the handsome beggar wearing tiger @-@ skin and smeared with ash had come riding a white bull and holding an axe , and used a skull as his begging bowl . Although he begged for alms , he would not accept any from the woman , deeming them \" petty \" . He did however warn the women of deceptions and cunning .

  "Names of three poets from the 11th century and some of their poems are available . Madara Chennaiah , a cobbler turned saint , is considered by H.S.

The lyrics are typically surreal and offbeat ; Deal 's main inspiration for the song and its title was a discarded art book she found on a New York City street while on tour in the late 1990s .

His script had Banner trying to create cells with regenerative capabilities in order to prove to himself that he is not like his father . However , he has anger management issues before the Hulk is even created , which makes everything worse .

  "Unlike his original model , Gilbert , Wodehouse preferred the music to be written first , fitting his words into the melodies . Donaldson suggests that this is the reason why his lyrics have largely been overlooked in recent years : they fit the music perfectly , but do not stand on their own in verse form as Gilbert 's do . Nonetheless , Donaldson adds , the book and lyrics for the Princess Theatre shows made the collaborators an enormous fortune and played an important part in the development of the American musical .

  "Except for water , the only other compound identified on the surface of Ariel by infrared spectroscopy is carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) , which is concentrated mainly on its trailing hemisphere . Ariel shows the strongest spectroscopic evidence for CO2 of any Uranian satellite , and was the first Uranian satellite on which this compound was discovered . The origin of the carbon dioxide is not completely clear . It might be produced locally from carbonates or organic materials under the influence of the energetic charged particles coming from Uranus 's magnetosphere or solar ultraviolet radiation . This hypothesis would explain the asymmetry in its distribution , as the trailing hemisphere is subject to a more intense magnetospheric influence than the leading hemisphere . Another possible source is the outgassing of primordial CO2 trapped by water ice in Ariel 's interior . The escape of CO2 from the interior may be related to past geological activity on this moon .",

  "Biological membranes typically include several types of molecules other than phospholipids . A particularly important example in animal cells is cholesterol , which helps strengthen the bilayer and decrease its permeability . Cholesterol also helps regulate the activity of certain integral membrane proteins . Integral membrane proteins function when incorporated into a lipid bilayer , and they are held tightly to lipid bilayer with the help of an annular lipid shell . Because bilayers define the boundaries of the cell and its compartments , these membrane proteins are involved in many intra- and inter @-@ cellular signaling processes . Certain kinds of membrane proteins are involved in the process of fusing two bilayers together . This fusion allows the joining of two distinct structures as in the fertilization of an egg by sperm or the entry of a virus into a cell .

  "Like all jumping spiders , P. schultzi can take in only a small visual field at one time , as the most acute part of a main eye can see all of a circle up to 12 millimeters wide at 20 centimeters away , or up to 18 millimeters wide at 30 centimeters away . A Portia spider takes a relatively long time to see objects , possibly because getting a good image out of such tiny eyes is a complex process and needs a lot of scanning . This makes a Portia vulnerable to much larger predators such as birds , frogs , and mantises , which it often cannot identify because of the other predator 's size .",

  "When receptive to mating , a female blacktip reef shark swims slowly in a sinusoidal pattern near the bottom with her head pointed down ; observations in the wild suggest female sharks release chemical signals that allow males to track them . Once the male finds her , he closes to around 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) and follows her with his snout oriented towards her vent . A courting male may also bite the female behind her gills or on her pectoral fins ; these mating wounds heal completely after 4 – 6 weeks . After a period of synchronous swimming , the male pushes the female on her side and positions her so her head is against the bottom and her tail is raised . Once the female is in position , the male inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca . Copulation lasts for several minutes , after which the sharks separate and resume their regular behavior . Off Moorea , individual older females mate and give birth at a consistent time every year , often to within a week 's precision , whereas younger females exhibit more variability in their timing . Younger females are also more likely to fail to become pregnant after mating .",

  "In the soil , the roots encounter the hyphae of fungi . Many of these are known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots . Some are specific to a single tree species , which will not flourish in the absence of its mycorrhizal associate . Others are generalists and associate with many species . The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree . The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed , transferring nutrients from one place to another . The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens . It can also limit damage done to a tree by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues . Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic , four hundred million years ago , when the first vascular plants colonised dry land .",

  "Bartlett 's initial plan had been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on together to the Siberian coast . However , because three men — Mamen , Malloch and Maurer — were injured , and others were weak and frostbitten , Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik . The pair started off on 18 March , with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days ( 30 days for the dogs ) , and took an extended route round the island 's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson 's or Mackay 's parties . After finding nothing , they headed across the ice towards Siberia , but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water . More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily drifting snow . As they drew nearer to the mainland , Kataktovik became nervous ; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people , and feared for his life . Bartlett did his best to reassure him as they moved slowly forward .",

  "The high radioactivity of einsteinium has a potential use in radiation therapy , and organometallic complexes have been synthesized in order to deliver einsteinium atoms to an appropriate organ in the body . Experiments have been performed on injecting einsteinium citrate ( as well as fermium compounds ) to dogs . Einsteinium ( III ) was also incorporated into beta @-@ diketone chelate complexes , since analogous complexes with lanthanides previously showed strongest UV @-@ excited luminescence among metallorganic compounds . When preparing einsteinium complexes , the Es3 + ions were 1000 times diluted with Gd3 + ions . This allowed reducing the radiation damage so that the compounds did not disintegrate during the period of 20 minutes required for the measurements . The resulting luminescence from Es3 + was much too weak to be detected . This was explained by the unfavorable relative energies of the individual constituents of the compound that hindered efficient energy transfer from the chelate matrix to Es3 + ions . Similar conclusion was drawn for other actinides americium , berkelium and fermium .",

  "Dispersal by vegetative propagules ( via soredia or isidia ) has been determined as the predominant mode of reproduction in L. pulmonaria . In this method , the protruding propagules become dry and brittle during the regular wet / dry cycles of the lichen , and can easily crumble off the thallus . These fragments may develop into new thalli , either at the same locale or at a new site after dispersal by wind or rain . A number of steps are required for the development of the vegetative propagules , including the degeneration of the thallus cortex , replication of green algal cells , and entanglement of fungal hyphae with the green algal cells . This steps lead to an increase in internal pressure which eventually breaks through the cortex . Continued growth leads to these granules being pushed upwards and out of the thallus surface .",

  "The enamel lies flush with the gold surfaces ; it was a preparation of finely ground glass paste applied with great care to the prepared recessed areas , and then fired . Different colours of enamel meet each other with a neat boundary , which was achieved by firing one colour with a retaining border of gum tragacanth before adding the next . The difficulty was increased by the application of tints of a different colour to a base shade of enamel before firing , so that the added colour blends gradually into the background colour around the edges of the tinted area . This is especially used on \" flux \" , or colourless enamel , as in the ground areas , rocks and trees . Flux was also used for flesh areas as on a gold background it darkens slightly when fired to a suitable colour for skin . The rouge clair or \" ruby glass \" red , used so effectively here , was made by adding tiny particles of copper , silver and gold to the glass ; here scientific tests have shown that copper was used . After firing the enamel was polished flush with the surrounding metal . The technique had been known to the Ancient Romans ( see the Lycurgus Cup , also in the British Museum ) , but was lost at the end of the Middle Ages until the 17th century . The added cylinders use opaque enamel , except for the red on the Tudor roses , which is translucent rouge clair , of a similar composition to the original reds .

  "In Final Fantasy XII , a mysterious phenomenon known as \" Mist \" is the key energy which allows characters to cast summoning magic and perform \" Quickenings \" . After defeating an Esper in combat , the player will be able to summon it to the battlefield . Similar to Final Fantasy X , the summoned creatures become active participants in battle , as opposed to the cinematic attacks seen in previous games in the series . Unlike Final Fantasy X , however , Espers follow hidden gambits , rather than the player 's direct command . The summoner remains an active member in the fight , able to attack and cast support magic , instead of leaving the party or standing idle while the summoned creature fights . An Esper will leave the battle if either the summoner or itself is knocked out , its time limit expires , or it executes its special attack . Some Espers have origins in Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy Tactics Advance and others are derived from the final bosses of previous Final Fantasy games such as Chaos , the final boss of the first Final Fantasy , and Zeromus , the final boss of Final Fantasy IV .",

  "The court then asked whether the right to vote was one of the \" privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States \" at the time of the Fourteenth Amendment 's adoption in 1868 . Citing a variety of historical sources , it found that it was not . The court reasoned that the Constitution of the United States did not explicitly give citizens an affirmative right to vote and that , throughout the history of the nation from the adoption of the Constitution , a wide variety of persons — including women — were recognized as citizens but denied the right to vote . For example , at the time of the adoption of the Constitution , none of the original Thirteen Colonies gave all citizens the right to vote , all attaching restrictions based on factors such as sex , race , age , and ownership of land .

  "Over land , intense , rapid solar heating of the land surface results in heating of the lowest layers of the atmosphere via reradiated energy in the infrared spectrum . The resulting hotter air is less dense than surrounding cooler air . This , combined with the rising of the hot air , results in the formation of a low pressure area . Elevated areas can enhance the strength of the thermal low as they warm more quickly than the atmosphere which surrounds them at the same altitude . Over the water , instability lows form during the winter when the air overlying the land is colder than the warmer water body . Thermal lows tend to have weak circulations , and can extend to 3 @,@ 100 metres ( 10 @,@ 200 ft ) in height .

Another fictional element is Marilena 's capacity of provoking short circuits , in moments in which she is very emotionally active ( e.g. , when Andrei touches her in the bar 's restroom , or when the whole neighborhood is cut from electricity when she cries near the high voltage electrical box ) .",

The second prevented unlicensed banks and their employees from initiating civil actions . The third prevented any person from challenging the constitutionality of Alberta 's laws in court without receiving the approval of the Lieutenant @-@ Governor in Council .

  "Gregory , however , also says that he thinks that Ingoberg was seventy years old in 589 ; and this would make her about forty when she married Charibert . This is possible , but seems unlikely , especially as Charibert seems to have had a preference for younger women , again according to Gregory 's account . This would imply an earlier birth date for Bertha . On the other hand , Gregory refers to Æthelberht at the time of his marriage to Bertha simply as \" a man of Kent \" , and in the 589 passage concerning Ingoberg 's death , which was written in about 590 or 591 , he refers to Æthelberht as \" the son of the king of Kent \" . If this does not simply reflect Gregory 's ignorance of Kentish affairs , which seems unlikely given the close ties between Kent and the Franks , then some assert that Æthelberht 's reign cannot have begun before 589 .",

  "Rather than utilizing makeup tactics , such as the ones used in A Beautiful Mind , to give Jeff Bridges a younger appearance , the character of Clu was completely computer generated . To show that this version of Clu was created some time after the events of the original film , the visual effects artists based his appearance on how Bridges looked in Against All Odds , released two years after Tron . The effects team hired makeup artist Rick Baker to construct a molded likeness of a younger Bridges head to serve as their basis for their CG work .

  "Although Barrowclough arrived in New Caledonia with his divisional headquarters in November 1942 , the main body of his command was not in place until January 1943 . Once on the island , his division began training in amphibious landings and jungle warfare to prepare it for forthcoming offensive operations while he set about dealing with the administrative and logistical problems of integrating the division into the American command structure . The 3rd Division was a division in name only , consisting of two infantry brigades – the 8th and 14th – instead of the three of a conventional infantry division , and he unsuccessfully agitated for expansion .

Barrowclough was unhappy at this decision and his relationship with Army headquarters in Wellington and its Chief of Staff , Lieutenant General Edward Puttick , became strained . The two brigade divisional structure also constrained how the 3rd Division could be employed in offensive operations , as it could not be used as a replacement for an American division due to its reduced number of personnel .

  "Although primarily a saprotrophic fungus involved in the post @-@ fire breakdown of duff and coniferous roots , Geopyxis carbonaria has been shown to be capable of forming ectomycorrhizae with Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) . It had been demonstrated earlier in laboratory experiments that the fungus has a biotrophic interaction with lodgepole pine ( Pinus contorta ) . The hyphae of G. carbonaria were able to infect the cortex of the tree seedling , but did not penetrate the endodermis .

Additionally , the fungus produces the enzyme polyphenol oxidase , and can break down the complex organic polymer lignin — features characteristic of saprotrophic fungi .

  "On February 17 , 1910 , the Chicoutimi Hockey Club played an exhibition match against the Montreal Canadiens . Though playing an inferior team the Canadiens failed to score a goal , losing the game . This prompted Joseph Cattarinich , goaltender for the Canadiens , to convince his team to offer a tryout to Georges Vézina , who was Chicoutimi 's goaltender . Vézina initially refused the offer , staying in Chicoutimi until the Canadiens returned in December of that year . This time they convinced Georges , along with his brother Pierre , to come to Montreal . The two Vézina brothers arrived on December 22 , 1910 .

He would play all 16 games for the Canadiens in the 1910 – 11 season , finishing with a record of eight wins and eight losses , while allowing the fewest goals in the league .",

  "The etymology of Mirza puzzled researchers for many years . Gray often created mysterious and unexplained taxonomic names — a trend not only continued with his description of Mirza in 1870 , but also with the genera Phaner ( fork @-@ marked lemurs ) and Azema ( for M. rufus , now a synonym for Microcebus ) , both of which were described in the same publication . In 1904 , American zoologist Theodore Sherman Palmer attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa , but could not definitively explain these three genera . For Mirza , Palmer only noted that it derived from the Persian title mîrzâ ( \" prince \" ) , a view tentatively supported by Alex Dunkel , Jelle Zijlstra , and Groves in 2012 . However , because the reference to Persian princes might have come from Arabian Nights , a popular piece of literature at the time , Dunkel et al. also searched the general literature published around 1870 . The origin of all three names was found in a British comedy The Palace of Truth by W. S. Gilbert , which premiered in London on 19 November 1870 , nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray 's manuscript ( also published in London ) . The comedy featured characters bearing all three names : King Phanor ( sic ) , Mirza , and Azema . The authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters .",
