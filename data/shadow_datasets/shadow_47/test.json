During the Texas Revolution , the creek was the site of two separate skirmishes . First , in October 1835 , at the beginning of the war , Captain Ben Milam was dispatched by Stephen F. Austin to survey the unfamiliar territory toward Cibolo Creek . Milam set up camp and soon discovered the tracks of a Mexican force of about a hundred cavalrymen . Austin sent additional scouts , and one group was confronted by about ten advancing Mexican patrols . The group 's lieutenant led an offensive against the patrols , and forced the Mexicans to retreat to San Antonio , allowing the Texans to march to Salado Creek . One Austin aide remarked : \" this little skirmish ... had a happy effect in the army ... [ and ] was regarded as a favorable omen . \" The second skirmish occurred in April 1836 , outside Camp Houston , a post established by Juan Seguín on the creek banks near present day Stockdale . Seguín set the post after being ordered to withdraw from San Antonio , with a regiment that severely lacked resources , including clothing and horses . During an exploration of the creek to find wild horses , Seguín and six men met some hostile Tonkawas . In a brief skirmish , two of the Native Americans were killed , allowing Seguín and his men to return to camp with two additional horses .",

  "The white stork breeds in greater numbers in areas with open grasslands , particularly grassy areas which are wet or periodically flooded , and less in areas with taller vegetation cover such as forest and shrubland . They make use of grasslands , wetlands , and farmland on the wintering grounds in Africa . White storks were probably aided by human activities during the Middle Ages as woodland was cleared and new pastures and farmland were created , and they were found across much of Europe , breeding as far north as Sweden . The population in Sweden is thought to have established in the 16th century after forests were cut down for agriculture . About 5000 pairs were estimated to breed in the 18th century which declined subsequently . The first accurate census in 1917 found 25 pairs and the last pair failed to breed around 1955 . The white stork is a rare visitor to the British Isles , as about 20 birds are seen in Britain every year , but there are no records of nesting .

  "During the last story arc from the manga , the story takes a darker tone than those from other shōnen series published by Shueisha .

  "For galaxies more distant than the Local Group and the nearby Virgo Cluster , but within a thousand megaparsecs or so , the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy 's distance . This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and has come to be known as Hubble 's law . Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts , in about the year 1912 , while Hubble correlated Slipher 's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law . In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity , redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space : this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us , the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy , so the more the light has been stretched , the more redshifted the light is , and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us . Hubble 's law follows in part from the Copernican principle . Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are , measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements , so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble 's law .",

Although he was 0 @.@ 93 s behind at the final turn , a final 50 m burst in 24 @.@ 36 s saw him cut a further 0 @.@ 42 s from his world record .

Thorpe fell behind in the early half of the leg before kicking away in the closing stages , to seal gold with his fastest @-@ ever relay split of 47 @.@ 87 s . In the 800 m final , he shadowed Hackett for the first 750 m , staying within a body length . He then broke clear to win by a body length , lowering his world record by over two seconds . The 200 m freestyle rematch with van den Hoogenband provided Thorpe with a chance to rectify his strategy from the Olympics ; this time he allowed the Dutchman to lead through the first 100 m .

After Matt Welsh , Regan Harrison and Geoff Huegill had finished their legs , Thorpe 's change left him half a body length behind the new 100 m world champion Anthony Ervin of the United States . The Americans were expected to win , and with his typically slow start , Thorpe turned a body length behind with 50 m remaining . With an American victory seeming inevitable , Thorpe managed to accelerate and deprive Ervin of the lead in the last 5 m . This made Thorpe the only swimmer to have won six gold medals at a World Championships , and the first since Shaw in 1974 to win the 200 – 400 – 800 treble . His performances formed the basis for Australia 's gold medal win over the United States 13 – 9 . It was also the first time since the 1956 Summer Olympics that Australia had topped the medal tally at a global meet . Thorpe 's achievements led to predictions that he could match Mark Spitz 's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics , which he played down .",

After the battle , British observers became convinced that the Arabs were not going to win the war , and compared the battle to the Luftwaffe 's failure in the Battle of Britain in 1940 , which showed that Germany was not going to win the air war .

A few days after the fiesta ended , on his birthday ( July 21 ) , he began to write the draft of what would become The Sun Also Rises , finishing eight weeks later . A few months later , in December 1925 , the Hemingways left to spend the winter in Schruns , Austria , where Hemingway began revising the manuscript extensively . Pauline Pfeiffer joined them in January and against Hadley 's advice , urged Hemingway to sign a contract with Scribner 's . He left Austria for a quick trip to New York to meet with the publishers , and on his return , during a stop in Paris , began an affair with Pfeiffer , before returning to Schruns to finish the revisions in March . The manuscript arrived in New York in April ; he corrected the final proof in Paris in August 1926 , and Scribner 's published the novel in October .",

  "The widespread belief in the limited intellectual and moral capacity of women came into conflict with a desire , intensified after the Reformation , for women to take greater personal moral responsibility , particularly as wives and mothers . In Protestantism this necessitated an ability to learn and understand the catechism and even to be able to independently read the Bible , but most commentators of the period , even those that tended to encourage the education of girls , thought they should not receive the same academic education as boys . Girls were only admitted to parish schools when there were insufficient numbers of boys to pay an adequate living for schoolmasters .

The Banu Qurayza eventually surrendered ; according to Ibn Ishaq , all the men apart from a few converts to Islam were beheaded , while the women and children were enslaved . Walid N. Arafat and Barakat Ahmad have disputed the accuracy of Ibn Ishaq 's narrative . Arafat believes that Ibn Ishaq 's Jewish sources , speaking over 100 years after the event , conflated this account with memories of earlier massacres in Jewish history ; he notes that Ibn Ishaq was considered an unreliable historian by his contemporary Malik ibn Anas , and a transmitter of \" odd tales \" by the later Ibn Hajar . Ahmad argues that only some of the tribe was killed , while some of the fighters were merely enslaved . Watt finds Arafat 's arguments \" not entirely convincing \" , while Meir J.

  "Social behaviour is influenced by the climate and geography ; as such , the impala are territorial at certain times of the year and gregarious at other times , and the length of these periods can vary broadly among populations . For instance , populations in southern Africa display territorial behaviour only during the few months of the rut , whereas in eastern African populations , territoriality is relatively minimal despite a protracted mating season . Moreover , territorial males often tolerate bachelors , and may even alternate between bachelorhood and territoriality at different times of the year . A study of impala in the Serengeti National Park showed that in 94 % of the males , territoriality was observed for less than four months .",

  "Much of Durkheim 's work was concerned with how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity ; an era in which traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed , and in which new social institutions have come into being . His first major sociological work was The Division of Labour in Society ( 1893 ) .

In 1898 , he established the journal L 'Année Sociologique . Durkheim 's seminal monograph , Suicide ( 1897 ) , a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations , pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy .

  "The species was first described as Scutiger subrubescens by American mycologist William Murrill in 1940 , based on collections that he found growing under oak near Gainesville , Florida , in November 1938 . In 1947 he transferred it to the genus Polyporus . Josiah Lincoln Lowe examined Murrill 's type material and thought that it did not differ from Albatrellus confluens . In 1965 , Zdeněk Pouzar made collections from Bohemia ( now the Czech Republic ) , and described it as a new species ( Albatrellus similis ) , unaware of the similarity to Murrill 's Florida specimens . Further study revealed that A. similis was identical to Murrill 's Scutiger subrubescens , and Pouzar transferred the latter epithet to Albatrellus . In 1974 , Pouzar recognized that Lowe 's species Albatrellus confluens was distinct from A. subrubescens . The specific epithet subrubescens , \" tinted reddish \" , is derived from the Latin words sub ( \" less than \" ) and rubescens ( \" growing red \" ) .",

On the eve of the shooting , Giffords had written to a Republican friend , Trey Grayson , Secretary of State of Kentucky , saying , \" we need to figure out how to tone our rhetoric and partisanship down . \" In March 2010 , Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin 's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats , including Giffords 's , in Arizona 's 8th district . Shortly after the map 's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month , Giffords said , \" We 're in Sarah Palin 's ' targeted ' list , but the thing is that the way she has it depicted , we 're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district . When people do that , they 've got to realize that there are consequences to that action . \" At that point in the interview , however , the interviewer said , \" campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years . \" The image was removed from Palin 's \" takebackthe20 \" website following the January shootings . Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video , rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting , and accusing the press of manufacturing a \" blood libel \" to blame her and the right wing for the attacks .",

  "In the half century preceding the arrival of the Spanish , the Kaqchikel were frequently at war with the Pipil of Izcuintepeque ( modern Escuintla ) . By March 1524 the K 'iche had been defeated , followed by a Spanish alliance with the Kaqchikel in April of the same year . On 8 May 1524 , soon after his arrival in Iximche and immediately following his subsequent conquest of the Tz 'utujil around Lake Atitlán , Pedro de Alvarado continued southwards to the Pacific coastal plain with an army numbering approximately 6000 , where he defeated the Pipil of Panacal or Panacaltepeque ( called Panatacat in the Annals of the Kaqchikels ) near Izcuintepeque on 9 May . Alvarado described the terrain approaching the town as very difficult , covered with dense vegetation and swampland that made the use of cavalry impossible ; instead he sent men with crossbows ahead . The Pipil withdrew their scouts because of the heavy rain , believing that the Spanish and their allies would not be able to reach the town that day . However , Pedro de Alvarado pressed ahead and when the Spanish entered the town the defenders were completely unprepared , with the Pipil warriors indoors sheltering from the torrential rain . In the battle that ensued , the Spanish and their indigenous allies suffered minor losses but the Pipil were able to flee into the forest , sheltered from Spanish pursuit by the weather and the vegetation . Pedro de Alvarado ordered the town to be burnt and sent messengers to the Pipil lords demanding their surrender , otherwise he would lay waste to their lands . According to Alvarado 's letter to Cortés , the Pipil came back to the town and submitted to him , accepting the king of Spain as their overlord . The Spanish force camped in the captured town for eight days . A few years later , in 1529 , Pedro de Alvarado was accused of using excessive brutality in his conquest of Izcuintepeque , amongst other atrocities .",

  "Prithvi Kumar Agrawala has traced at least six different lists of fifty or more aspects or forms of Ganesha each with their specific female consorts or shaktis .

  "Particularly prominent in the ocean waters surrounding Hilton Head Island , the stingray serves as a fascination and painful natural encounter for many beach goers . Small stingrays inhabit the quieter , shallow region of ocean floor just beyond the break of the surf , typically buried beneath a thin layer of sand . Stingrays are a type of demersal , cartilaginous fish common to the South Carolina coast as well as other areas on the Atlantic shoreline . Typically , stingrays avoid contact with humans unless they are accidentally stepped upon , a situation often ending in a stingray injury , where the stingray punctures the human with its poisonous barb . While these injuries are extremely painful , they are not usually life @-@ threatening as long as they are properly attended to by a medical professional . One complaint shared by many Hilton Head Island tourists is that the lifeguards maintain a poor alert system for notifying swimmers when numerous stingrays have been sighted within a specific stretch of the shore . This lack of notification on days when multiple sightings are reported can sometimes end in a high number of stingray injuries that might have otherwise been avoided ; in 2009 , 121 people were treated for stingray injuries .",

  "By the time of the elder Joseph Terry 's death in 1850 , Terry 's was becoming a household name due to its previous trade successes across the country . The younger Joseph , along with his two brothers , Robert and John , are credited with moving confectionery production to an industrial scale with the leasing of a factory at Clementhorpe , beside the River Ouse , in 1862 . Its location was particularly advantageous , as the 22 @-@ year @-@ old Terry had drawn inspiration from the manipulation of the railways initiated by his father , and saw the benefit of importing and exporting from the river using steamboats . Vessels from the River Humber supplied coal for the factory , while larger ships would import ingredients such as sugar and cocoa from around the world twice a week . The Clementhorpe factory also improved the logistics of the company , providing ample room for the construction of warehouses to store stock . Two years later , there were 400 separate items in the firm 's price list , with around 13 of them consisting of chocolate as a main ingredient ; others included various candied peels , cakes , biscuits and jams among other more exotic products such as cream balls .",

  "Tropical Storm Erika originated from a tropical wave accompanied by disorganized shower and thunderstorm activity that moved off the west coast of Africa , near the Cape Verde Islands , on August 25 . The following day , convection surrounding the wave began to show signs of organization as it tracked westward across the Atlantic . By August 28 , an area of low pressure developed from the wave . Environmental conditions ahead of the low were favorable for further development of the system . Despite the favorable conditions , the low became increasingly disorganized on August 29 , with little convection remaining around the center of circulation . The next day , the system quickly became organized , with shower and thunderstorms developing around the center and the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) noted that the low would likely become a tropical depression within 24 hours . Although convection was well @-@ organized , the system lacked a defined low @-@ level circulation center , leading to the NHC not issuing advisories on the system at that time .",

  "At the 500 hPa level , the air temperature averages -7 ° C ( 18 ° F ) within the tropics , but air in the tropics is normally dry at this level , giving the air room to wet @-@ bulb , or cool as it moistens , to a more favorable temperature that can then support convection . A wetbulb temperature at 500 hPa in a tropical atmosphere of − 13 @.@ 2 ° C ( 8 @.@ 2 ° F ) is required to initiate convection if the water temperature is 26 @.@ 5 ° C ( 79 @.@ 7 ° F ) , and this temperature requirement increases or decreases proportionally by 1 ° C in the sea surface temperature for each 1 ° C change at 500 hpa . Under a cold cyclone , 500 hPa temperatures can fall as low as − 30 ° C ( − 22 ° F ) , which can initiate convection even in the driest atmospheres . This also explains why moisture in the mid @-@ levels of the troposphere , roughly at the 500 hPa level , is normally a requirement for development .

At heights near the tropopause , the 30 @-@ year average temperature ( as measured in the period encompassing 1961 through 1990 ) was -77 ° C ( -132 ° F ) .",

Holden issued a Series II revision in September 1994 bringing audible warning chimes for the handbrake and fuel level among other changes .",
  "Finn , terrified of the ocean , decides to do this final task for Billy , but the Fear Feaster ( voiced by Mark Hamill ) manifests and taunts him , until he knocks himself unconscious ; during this time , he has an intense dream of swimming through the ocean and being consumed by a whale . Eventually he wakes up , and — possibly involuntarily — uses his grass sword to slice through and destroy the Fear Feaster , ending Finn 's ocean fear for good .

Before his spirit departs , he reveals to Finn that his human father is still alive , trapped in a mysterious place known only as the \" Citadel \" .",
  "The book states that Seitz , Singer , Nierenberg and Robert Jastrow were all fiercely anti @-@ communist and they viewed government regulation as a step towards socialism and communism . The authors argue that , with the collapse of the Soviet Union , they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism . They feared that an over @-@ reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy @-@ handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people 's lives . Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get , and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and market fundamentalists most fear . They say that Seitz , Singer , Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence , contributed to a strategy of delay , and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded . The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question ; however , they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science . The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped , according to the authors , to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians . Oreskes and Conway state : \" small numbers of people can have large , negative impacts , especially if they are organised , determined and have access to power \" .",

  "Governor Broward ran for the U.S. Senate in 1908 but lost . Broward and his predecessor , William Jennings , were paid by Richard Bolles to tour the state to promote drainage . Broward was elected to the Senate in 1910 , but died before he could take office . He was eulogized across Florida for his leadership and progressive inspiration . Rapidly growing Fort Lauderdale paid him tribute by naming Broward County after him ( the town 's original plan had been to name it Everglades County ) . Land in the Everglades was being sold for $ 15 an acre a month after Broward died . Meanwhile , Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them . News of the Panama Canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port .

A termite king and queen will not mate until they find such a spot . When they do , they excavate a chamber big enough for both , close up the entrance and proceed to mate . After mating , the pair will never go outside and will spend the rest of their lives in the nest . Nuptial flight time varies in each species .

  "Odontocetes are known as toothed whales ; they have teeth and only one blowhole . They rely on their well @-@ developed sonar to find their way in the water .

These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw , which is then rerouted into the ear @-@ bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted . All toothed whales are opportunistic , meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew .

  "Arabs and Khazars continued to clash sporadically in the North Caucasus in the 9th and 10th centuries , but warfare was localized and of far lower intensity than the great wars of the 8th century .

  "The karmic bondage occurs as a result of the following two processes : āsrava and bandha . Āsrava is the inflow of karma . The karmic influx occurs when the particles are attracted to the soul on account of yoga . Yoga is the vibrations of the soul due to activities of mind , speech and body . However , the yoga alone do not produce bondage . The karmas have effect only when they are bound to the consciousness . This binding of the karma to the consciousness is called bandha . Out of the many causes of bondage , emotions or passions are considered as the main cause of bondage . The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions . The passions like anger , pride , deceit and greed are called sticky ( kaṣāyas ) because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in bandha .

  "As Dean of Christchurch , Hilary restored the organization to its traditional round of religious ceremonies that had been abandoned by his predecessors , as well as securing grants of privileges and lands . He ordered the writing of a history of the church at Christchurch , a book which still survives . Hilary was unsuccessful as a candidate for the archbishopric of York against Henry Murdac in 1147 , but Pope Eugene III chose to compensate him by appointing him to the see of Chichester . His candidacy to York had been supported by Hugh de Puiset , then treasurer of York and later Bishop of Durham , and by Robert of Ghent , who was Dean of York and Lord Chancellor of England , as well as by King Stephen of England . Hilary seems to have received the largest number of votes , but because the election was disputed by Murdac 's supporters the result was referred to the papacy , and Eugene chose Murdac . Hilary was appointed to Chichester in July 1147 , and he was consecrated on 3 August 1147 . Theobald of Bec , the Archbishop of Canterbury , consecrated him at Canterbury , with Nigel , the Bishop of Ely , Robert , the Bishop of Bath , and William de Turbeville , the Bishop of Norwich , assisting in the ceremony .

  "Fossil ( or subfossil ) black vultures cannot necessarily be attributed to the Pleistocene or the recent species without further information : the same size variation found in the living bird was also present in its larger prehistoric relative .

The southern birds were of the same size as present @-@ day north black vultures and can only be distinguished by their somewhat stouter tarsometatarsus and the flatter and wider bills , and even then only with any certainty if the location where the fossils were found is known . As the Pleistocene and current black vultures form an evolutionary continuum rather than splitting into two or more lineages , some include the Pleistocene taxa in C. atratus .",

As a transcription factor , Tbr1 modulates the expression of RELN , which encodes the Reln protein that forms part of the extracellular matrix of cells . Thus , through regulation of Reln expression , Tbr1 regulates the formation of the matrix through which neurons migrate . Without Tbr1 , neurons fail to migrate properly .",

  "Van der Weyden 's depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany , identified by the time of Pope Gregory I as the repentant prostitute of Luke 7 : 36 – 50 .

Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes , associating tears with words , and in turn weeping with reading . Examples can be seen in 16th @-@ century works by Tintoretto and Titian which show the Magdalen reading , often with her eyes averted towards her book ( and presumably away from a male gaze ) , or looking up to the heavens or , sometimes , glancing coyly towards the viewer .

  "Following the April 2005 release of Jean Brault 's damaging testimony at the Gomery Commission , implicating the Liberals in the scandal , opinion polls placed the Conservatives ahead of Liberals . The Conservatives had earlier abstained from the vote on the 2005 budget to avoid forcing an election . With the collapse in Liberal support and a controversial NDP amendment to the budget , the party exerted significant pressure on Harper to bring down the government . In May , Harper announced that the government had lost the \" moral authority to govern \" . Shortly thereafter , the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois united to defeat the government on a vote that some considered to be either a confidence motion or else a motion requiring an immediate test of the confidence of the House . The Martin government did not accept this interpretation and argued that vote had been on a procedural motion , although they also indicated that they would bring forward their revised budget for a confidence vote the following week . Ultimately , the effort to bring down the Government failed following the decision of Conservative MP Belinda Stronach to cross the floor to the Liberal Party . The vote on the NDP amendment to the budget tied , and with the Speaker of the House voting to continue debate , the Liberals stayed in power . At the time , some considered the matter to be a constitutional crisis .",

More broadly , he has also been described as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action . In the 1940s , the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams , who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics , as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline . Williams ' approach strongly influenced historians for much of the latter part of the 20th century . However , more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition , and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals , as well as a recognition of the anti @-@ slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns .",

  "By the early 20th century , the feral horse herds became the target of local ranchers looking to limit grazing competition for their livestock . Many horses were rounded up , and either used as ranch horses , sold for slaughter or shot .

  "France controlled a number of trading harbours along the Indian coast including Mahé and Chandernagore , all governed from the larger port of Pondicherry . However , the strongest French position in the region was the isolated island of Île de France , later known as Mauritius , with its subordinate bases of Réunion and small settlements on Madagascar in the Seychelles and on Rodrigues . Île de France , centred on the capital Port Louis , had important commercial agricultural features and an economy dominated by African slave labour . The islands were only commercially viable when left ungarrisoned , and if any troops had to be supported or the islands came under blockade there were corresponding economic difficulties and food shortages . The island was most valuable as a naval base , situated in an ideal position for raiders to intercept British trade between Europe and the East Indies . The upheavals of the French Revolution had reached Île de France , with accusations against senior officials leading to arrests in 1792 .

  "There are many themes found in this book ; some that are recurring are roles in society , religion , relationships , and also hybrid nature of American and Mexican ethnicities . Within these short stories Cisneros concentrates on the identities which women appropriate as a result of relationships , and how these are connected with their roles in society . Critic Mary Reichart observes that in Cisneros 's previous work as well as \" in Woman Hollering Creek ( 1991 ) , the female characters break out of the molds assigned to them by the culture in search of new roles and new kinds of relationships . Cisneros portrays women who challenge stereotypes and break taboos , sometimes simply for the sake of shocking the establishment , but most often because the confining stereotypes prevent them from achieving their own identity . \" An example of this is Cleófilas , who had hoped for a better life after leaving her home in Mexico to live in the United States . The soap operas she had seen had led her to believe that her life was going to be a fairy tale . Instead , with a failing marriage and another child on the way she sees that her life resembles only the saddest aspects of a soap opera . Another example of this is found in the final section of this book , entitled \" There Was A Man , There Was A Woman \" , where Cisneros illustrates how women can use their bodies as political instruments in their attempts to fight against male domination . The two female protagonists in \" Never Marry a Mexican \" and \" Eyes of Zapata \" use their bodies in attempts to gain recognition and acceptance from husband and lover . However , in doing so , they face the problems of objectification and oppression ; two issues which end up adversely shaping the characters ' identities . In the end , the illegitimate societal roles of these women influence their quest for female identity . For example , Inés , in \" Eyes of Zapata \" , talks about the role she plays as lover , not a wife : \" You married her , that woman from Villa de Ayala , true . But see , you came back to me . You always come back . In between and beyond the others . That 's my magic . You come back to me . \"",

To sway Justinian , Thurisind 's envoys reminded him of their long tradition of alliance and promised to fight against Byzantium 's enemies . However , the emperor sided with the Lombards ; he made them formal allies and promised to provide troops against the Gepids .

  "Kruger and the volksraad resolved to send yet another deputation to London to renegotiate the Pretoria Convention and settle the western border issue . The third deputation , comprising Kruger , Smit and Du Toit with Jan Eloff as secretary , left the Transvaal in August 1883 and sailed from Cape Town two months later . Kruger spent part of the voyage to Britain studying the English language with a Bible printed in Dutch and English side by side .

Britain ended its suzerainty , reduced the Transvaal 's national debt and once again recognised the country as the South African Republic . The western border question remained unresolved , but Kruger still considered the convention a triumph .",

  "Quran 54 : 1 @-@ 2 was part of the debate between medieval Muslim theologians and Muslims philosophers over the issue of the inviolability of heavenly bodies . The philosophers held that nature was composed of four fundamental elements : earth , air , fire , and water . These philosophers however held that the composition of heavenly bodies were different . This belief was based on the observation that the motion of heavenly bodies , unlike that of terrestrial bodies , was circular and without any beginnings or ends . This appearance of eternity in the heavenly bodies , led the philosophers to conclude that the heavens were inviolable . Theologians on the other hand proposed their own conception of the terrestrial matter : the nature was composed of uniform atoms that were re @-@ created at every instant by God ( the latter idea was added to defend God 's omnipotence against the encroachment of the independent secondary causes ) . According to this conception , the heavenly bodies were essentially the same as the terrestrial bodies , and thus could be pierced .",

  "There is some evidence that Christianity made inroads into the Viking controlled Highlands and Islands before the official conversion at the end of the tenth century .

  "On 23 April 1858 , out of the 91 escapees one person who was saved by the Anadamanese people was Dudnath Tiwari , a political prisoner . He was absorbed into the aboriginal culture , married two of their girls , and learned their language . However , when the Andamanese were on the verge of mounting a massive attack on the penal colony on 16 May 1859 , he ran away and secretly conveyed this information to the Superintendent . The aboriginals attacked the camp with bows and arrows but were completely routed by the superior weapons of the British . This battle came to be known as the \" Battle of Aberdeen \" , the first initiative by the local people to seek independence from the British rule . This resulted in change of approach by the British to handle the local people : steps were initiated to seek peace with them and a British officer was appointed to look after their welfare .",
  "Treating motor symptoms with surgery was once a common practice , but since the discovery of levodopa , the number of operations declined . Studies in the past few decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques , so that surgery is again being used in people with advanced PD for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient . Surgery for PD can be divided in two main groups : lesional and deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) . Target areas for DBS or lesions include the thalamus , the globus pallidus or the subthalamic nucleus . Deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) is the most commonly used surgical treatment , developed in the 1980s by Alim @-@ Louis Benabid and others . It involves the implantation of a medical device called a neurostimulator which sends electrical impulses to specific parts of the brain . DBS is recommended for people who have PD with motor fluctuations and tremor inadequately controlled by medication , or to those who are intolerant to medication , as long as they do not have severe neuropsychiatric problems . Other , less common , surgical therapies involve intentional formation of lesions to suppress overactivity of specific subcortical areas . For example , pallidotomy involves surgical destruction of the globus pallidus to control dyskinesia .",

  "Gilbert Foliot 's letters provide some background to Chesney 's election , showing that King Stephen of England and Stephen 's brother Henry of Blois , the Bishop of Winchester , attempted to secure Lincoln for one of their relatives : the royal candidates were the abbots of Fécamp , Westminster , and St Benet 's of Hulme . They were rejected by Pope Eugene III , paving the way for the chapter to elect Chesney . Foliot relates that the electors from the chapter travelled to London , where they proceeded to elect Chesney in front of Foliot , Theobald , and some other bishops . That account is contradicted by Chesney 's profession of obedience to Theobald , which claims that the election took place on 13 December 1148 at Westminster . Henry of Huntingdon and Ralph de Diceto , both medieval chroniclers , approved of the election and mentioned the unanimous nature of Chesney 's selection .

  "The campaign culminating in Kray 's evacuation of Ulm was one of Moreau 's most resounding triumphs . Napoleon Bonaparte had given Moreau specific instructions about the conduct of the campaign , all of which Moreau had ignored . Regardless , their combined efforts damaged Habsburg military operations . In Spring 1800 , while Moreau wrecked Austrian defenses in Germany , Massena and Desaix ran into stiff Austrian offensives in Northern Italy . Napoleon brought in the reserve corps and defeated the Austrians at Marengo . The battle near Höchstädt , five days after the Austrian disaster at Marengo , allowed the French to take Munich . The combined efforts forced the Habsburgs to accept an armistice ended hostilities for the rest of the summer , but the French extracted massive levies on the Bavarians . Despite these significant losses — both of them decisive — the Austrians were reluctant to accept disadvantageous peace terms . In mid @-@ November , the French ended the truce and Moreau inflicted another significant and decisive defeat at Hohenlinden on 3 December 1800 .

The bombardment was planned to last about a week at all points on the line , with a much longer and heavier barrage at Vimy to weaken its strong defences . During the assault , the troops would advance in open formation , with units leapfrogging each other to allow them time to consolidate and regroup . Before the action could be undertaken , a great deal of preparation was required , much of it innovative .",

  "In tropical areas , when the monsoon arrives , high daytime high temperatures drop and overnight low temperatures increase . During the wet season , a combination of heavy rainfall and , in some places such as Hong Kong , an onshore wind , improve air quality . In Brazil , the wet season is correlated with weaker trade winds off the ocean . The pH level of water becomes more balanced due to the charging of local aquifers during the wet season . Water also softens , as the concentration of dissolved materials reduces during the rainy season . Erosion is also increased during rainy periods . Arroyos that are dry at other times of the year fill with runoff , in some cases with water as deep as 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) . Leaching of soils during periods of heavy rainfall depletes nutrients . The higher runoff from land masses affects nearby ocean areas , which are more stratified , or less mixed , due to stronger surface currents forced by the heavy rainfall runoff .",
  "Romantic notions of the 1920s as a more innocent period are put aside in favor of depicting Los Angeles as ruled by a despotic political infrastructure , steeped in sadistic , systematic corruption throughout the city government , police force and medical establishment . In addition to being a Kafkaesque drama about the search for a missing child , the film also focuses on issues relevant to the modern era . Eastwood noted a correlation between the corruption of 1920s Los Angeles and that of the modern era , manifesting in the egos of a police force that thinks it cannot be wrong and the way in which powerful organizations justify the use of corruption . \" [ The ] Los Angeles police department every so often seems to go into a period of corruption , \" he said , \" It 's happened even in recent years ... so it was nice to comment [ on that ] by going back to real events in 1928 . \" Eastwood said that Los Angeles had always been seen as \" glamorous \" , but he believed there had never been a \" golden age \" in the city . In Changeling , this dissonance manifests in the actions of Arthur Hutchins , who travels to the city in the hope of meeting his favorite actor . Eastwood said that given the corruption that the story covers , Hutchins ' naïvete seemed \" bizarre \" . As a lesson in democratic activism , the film shows what it takes to provoke people to speak against unchecked authority , no matter the consequences . Richard Brody of The New Yorker said this rang as true for 1928 Los Angeles as it did for Poland in 1980 or Pakistan in 2008 . The film directly quotes Chief of police James E. Davis : \" We will hold trial on gunmen in the streets of Los Angeles . I want them brought in dead , not alive , and I will reprimand any officer who shows the least bit of mercy to a criminal . \" It compares police excess to the vigilantism of the Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s , as the department 's \" Gun Squad \" carries out illegal executions of criminals — \" not to stamp out crime ... but ' competition ' \" . The pressure from the police hierarchy was a motivator for officers to quickly solve Walter Collins ' disappearance , and a potential reason why they ignored the fact they had returned the wrong child .",

This culminated in the rise of Cínaed mac Ailpín ( Kenneth MacAlpin ) in the 840s , which brought to power the House of Alpin . In AD 867 the Vikings seized Northumbria , forming the Kingdom of York ; three years later they stormed the Britons ' fortress of Dumbarton and subsequently conquered much of England except for a reduced Kingdom of Wessex , leaving the new combined Pictish and Gaelic kingdom almost encircled .

  "After the death of emperor Ivan Alexander on 17 February 1371 , Ivan Sratsimir broke off the last links that connected Tarnovo and Vidin and began to rule without even nominal acknowledgement to the authorities in Tarnovo . He was since styled , as written in the accounts of the Patriarchate of Constantinople : \" How should the Patriarch and the Archbishop write to ruler of Vidin and emperor Kamtsimir ( Sratsimir ) : Most Faithful and Allmighty ruler of Vidin the whole of Bulgaria ... \" The authority of Ivan Sratsimir was treated as equal to that of Ivan Shishman and the details suggest that he was even presented as a senior ruler . Due to the insufficient information , some early Bulgarian historians such as Konstantin Jireček supported the hypothesis that Ivan Sratsimir and Ivan Shishman were engaged in a military conflict over Sofia but the idea has been dismissed by most modern historians . In fact , despite the rivalry , the brothers scrupulously maintained relations until 1381 and Ivan Sratsimir was even considered as a potential successor by Ivan Shishman . However , J. Fine suggests that immediately after the death of his father , Ivan Sratsimir tried to seize the control over the whole of Bulgaria for himself and even captured and held Sofia for a year or two , which led to permanent hostility between the two brothers and spoiled any chances for a common Bulgarian resistance against the Ottomans .",
  "The Peasants ' Revolt has been widely studied by academics . Late 19th @-@ century historians used a range of sources from contemporary chroniclers to assemble an account of the uprising , and these were supplemented in the 20th century by research using court records and local archives . Interpretations of the revolt have shifted over the years . It was once seen as a defining moment in English history , but modern academics are less certain of its impact on subsequent social and economic history . The revolt heavily influenced the course of the Hundred Years ' War , by deterring later Parliaments from raising additional taxes to pay for military campaigns in France . The revolt has been widely used in socialist literature , including by the author William Morris , and remains a potent political symbol for the political left , informing the arguments surrounding the introduction of the Community Charge in the United Kingdom during the 1980s .",

  "Estimates of the numbers of tanks in Britain after the fall of France vary ; Viscount Cranbourne stated in the House of Lords ( in 1942 ) that Britain only had 50 infantry tanks and 200 light tanks armed only with machine guns , and these figures have become the basis of the myth that the British Army in June 1940 had very few tanks .
