  "Although pest insects attract the most attention , many insects are beneficial to the environment and to humans . Some insects , like wasps , bees , butterflies and ants , pollinate flowering plants . Pollination is a mutualistic relationship between plants and insects . As insects gather nectar from different plants of the same species , they also spread pollen from plants on which they have previously fed . This greatly increases plants ' ability to cross @-@ pollinate , which maintains and possibly even improves their evolutionary fitness . This ultimately affects humans since ensuring healthy crops is critical to agriculture . As well as pollination ants help with seed distribution of plants . This helps to spread the plants which increases plant diversity . This leads to an overall better environment . A serious environmental problem is the decline of populations of pollinator insects , and a number of species of insects are now cultured primarily for pollination management in order to have sufficient pollinators in the field , orchard or greenhouse at bloom time . Another solution , as shown in Delaware , has been to raise native plants to help support native pollinators like L. vierecki . Insects also produce useful substances such as honey , wax , lacquer and silk . Honey bees have been cultured by humans for thousands of years for honey , although contracting for crop pollination is becoming more significant for beekeepers . The silkworm has greatly affected human history , as silk @-@ driven trade established relationships between China and the rest of the world .",

In his sleeve notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1 – 3 ( Rare & Unreleased ) 1961 – 1991 , John Bauldie writes that it was Pete Seeger who first identified the melody of \" Blowin ' in the Wind \" as Dylan 's adaptation of the old Negro spiritual \" No More Auction Block \" . According to Alan Lomax 's The Folk Songs of North America , the song originated in Canada and was sung by former slaves who fled there after Britain abolished slavery in 1833 . In 1978 , Dylan acknowledged the source when he told journalist Marc Rowland : \" ' Blowin ' in the Wind ' has always been a spiritual .

The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America .

  "Monsoons are caused by the larger amplitude of the seasonal cycle of land temperature compared to that of nearby oceans . This differential warming happens because heat in the ocean is mixed vertically through a \" mixed layer \" that may be fifty meters deep , through the action of wind and buoyancy @-@ generated turbulence , whereas the land surface conducts heat slowly , with the seasonal signal penetrating perhaps a meter or so . Additionally , the specific heat capacity of liquid water is significantly higher than that of most materials that make up land . Together , these factors mean that the heat capacity of the layer participating in the seasonal cycle is much larger over the oceans than over land , with the consequence that the air over the land warms faster and reaches a higher temperature than the air over the ocean . The hot air over the land tends to rise , creating an area of low pressure . This creates a steady wind blowing toward the land , bringing the moist near @-@ surface air over the oceans with it . Similar rainfall is caused by the moist ocean air being lifted upwards by mountains , surface heating , convergence at the surface , divergence aloft , or from storm @-@ produced outflows at the surface .

  "Fuller was an early proponent of feminism and especially believed in providing education to women .

She once said , \" If you ask me what office women should fill , I reply — any ... let them be sea captains if you will . I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office \" . She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time . Fuller also warned women to be careful about marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands . As she wrote , \" I wish woman to live , first for God 's sake . Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god , and thus sink to idolatry . Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty \" .

  "Greenlandic verbs inflect for agreement with agent and patient , for mood and for voice . There are eight moods , of which four are used in independent clauses and four in subordinate clauses . The four independent moods are : indicative , interrogative , imperative , optative . The four dependent moods are causative , conditional , contemporative , and participial . Verbal roots can take transitive , intransitive or negative inflections , so that all eight mood suffixes have these three forms . The inflectional system is further complicated by the fact that transitive suffixes encode both agent and patient in a single morpheme , requiring up to 48 different suffixes to cover all possible combinations of agent and patient for each of the eight transitive paradigms . As some moods do not have forms for all persons ( imperative only has 2nd person , optative only 1st and 3rd person , participial mood has no 4th person and contemporative has no 3rd person ) , the total number of verbal inflectional suffixes is about 318 .",

  "Aposematism is a widely used function of bioluminescence , providing a warning that the creature concerned is unpalatable .

Much of the initial level development was done on paper and to explore situations not commonly found in video games , due to their vocabulary system . They ended up selecting more than a hundred levels out of over seven hundred they had generated internally for the game . Both Merits and Ollars were added to reward the player for completion , with Slaczka comparing these to Xbox Live Achievements .",

  "The pygmy three @-@ toed sloth was first described by Robert P. Anderson of the University of Kansas and Charles O. Handley Jr . , of the Smithsonian Institution in 2001 . The researchers noted that the three @-@ toed sloths endemic to Isla Escudo de Veraguas , a small island off the coast of Panama , are significantly smaller than those that occur on the nearby outer islands of Bocas del Toro Province . Moreover , they differ from other populations in terms of pelage and cranial characteristics . Hence , they considered the three @-@ toed sloths in Isla Escudo de Veraguas to be an independent species and formally described it from the skin and skull of an adult female . The researchers further pointed out that Isla Escudos de Veraguas is the oldest island and located farthest from the mainland , that began breaking up into small islands due to rises in sea levels 10 @,@ 000 years ago . They proposed that this species evolved from an isolated population that had originated from the mainland population of brown @-@ throated three @-@ toed sloths ; it gradually differentiated enough to become an independent species through insular dwarfism . In another study the following year , the researchers observed that the mean body size of three @-@ toed sloths on an island decreases linearly as the age of the island increases ; the area of the island and the distance from the mainland , however , do not appear to significantly affect dwarfing .",

  "The expansion of Alba into the wider Kingdom of Scotland was a gradual process combining external conquest and the suppression of occasional rebellions with the extension of seigniorial power through the placement of effective agents of the crown . Neighbouring independent kings became subject to Alba and eventually disappeared from the records . In the ninth century the term mormaer , meaning \" great steward \" , began to appear in the records to describe the rulers of Moray , Strathearn , Buchan , Angus and Mearns , who may have acted as \" marcher lords \" for the kingdom to counter the Viking threat . Later the process of consolidation is associated with the feudalism introduced by David I , which , particularly in the east and south where the crown 's authority was greatest , saw the placement of lordships , often based on castles , and the creation of administrative sheriffdoms , which overlay the pattern of local thegns . It also saw the English earl and Latin comes begin to replace the mormaers in the records . The result has been seen as a \" hybrid kingdom , in which Gaelic , Anglo @-@ Saxon , Flemish and Norman elements all coalesced under its ' Normanised ' , but nevertheless native lines of kings \" .",

  "Nixon 's advisors denied he had abandoned a desire to bring the American people together .

According to Safire , after taking office , Nixon and his advisors decided he need not bring the country together , but need only work to secure his reelection by appealing to voters who were not hostile to Nixon and his policies — they became known as the Silent Majority . Historian Stanley Kutler suggested in his book on the Nixon administration that Nixon 's policies widened divisions in America , but that the nation finally came together late in his presidency — to reject Nixon and demand his removal .",

However , when Colbeck was available again , Nix was dropped to the substitutes ' bench , with new signing Paul McLaren partnering Lee Bullock , who had returned from injury , in central midfield . Nix struggled for form but was also playing with an ankle injury , which eventually forced him to take a hospital scan in November . He was one of six club midfielders to be injured at the time . He returned to action later that month as a second @-@ half substitute against his father 's former team Rotherham United , at the Don Valley Stadium .

  "In early 1922 , the world 's major navies , including Italy , signed the Washington Naval Treaty . According to the terms of the treaty , Italy could keep Vittorio Emanuele and her three sisters , along with the newer dreadnought battleships . Due to the small size and age of the ships , particularly in comparison to the modern dreadnoughts , the Italians could have kept the ships in service indefinitely . They could not , however , be replaced by new battleships under the normal practice of the Treaty system , which provided for replacements after a ship was 20 years old .

  "The antibody isotype of a B cell changes during cell development and activation .

  "Before the industrialization of chicken production , and the creation of broiler breeds of chicken , only young spring chickens ( pullets or cockerels ) would be suitable for the higher heat and relatively fast cooking time of frying , making fried chicken a luxury of spring and summer . Older , tougher birds require longer cooking times at lower temperatures . To compensate for this , sometimes tougher birds are simmered till tender , allowed to cool and dry , and then fried . ( This method is common in Australia . ) Another method is to fry the chicken pieces using a pan fried method . The chicken pieces are then simmered in liquid , usually , a gravy made in the pan that the chicken pieces were cooked in . This process ( of flouring , frying and simmering in gravy ) is known as \" smothering \" and can be used for other tough cuts of meat , such as swiss steak . Smothered chicken is still consumed today , though with the exception of people who raise their own chickens , or who seek out stewing hens , it is primarily made using commercial broiler chickens .",

  "The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a predator of great tits , with the young from second broods being at higher risk partly because of the hawk 's greater need for food for its own developing young .

Other nest predators include introduced grey squirrels ( in Britain ) and least weasels , which are able to take nesting adults as well . A species of biting louse ( Mallophaga ) described as Rostrinirmus hudeci was isolated and described in 1981 from great tits in central Europe . The hen flea Ceratophyllus gallinae is exceedingly common in the nests of blue and great tits .

  "On the early Earth , reactive elements , such as iron and uranium , existed in a reduced form that would react with any free oxygen produced by photosynthesising organisms . Oxygen would not be able to build up in the atmosphere until all the iron had rusted ( producing banded iron formations ) , and all the other reactive elements had been oxidised . Donald Canfield detected records of the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared – and the presence of atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation . Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses ; the rise of small , sessile ( stationary ) organisms seems to correlate with an early oxygenation event , with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of oxygenation . However , the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism , with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous .",

  "Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1 @,@ 200 mm ( 47 in ) in the eastern parts of Formosa Province to a low of 450 to 500 mm ( 18 to 20 in ) in the west and southwest . Most of the precipitation is concentrated in the summer and decreases from east to west . Summer rains are intense , and torrential rain is common , occasionally causing floods and soil erosion . During the winter months , precipitation is sparse . Eastern areas receive more precipitation than western areas since they are more influenced by moist air from the Atlantic Ocean . This penetrates the eastern areas more than the west , bringing it more precipitation . As a result , the vegetation differs with eastern areas being covered by forests , savannas , marshes , and subtropical wet forest , while western areas are dominated by medium and low forests of mesophytic and xerophytic trees , and a dense understory of shrubs and grasses . The western part has a pronounced dry winter season while the eastern parts have a slightly drier season . In all parts of the region , precipitation is highly variable from year to year . The eastern part of the region receives just enough precipitation to have a positive water balance . By contrast , the western parts of the region have a negative water balance ( the potential evapotranspiration exceeds the precipitation ) owing to lower precipitation .",

  "Weather fronts are boundaries between two masses of air of different densities , or different temperature and moisture properties , which normally are convergence zones in the wind field and are the principal cause of significant weather . Within surface weather analyses , they are depicted using various colored lines and symbols . The air masses usually differ in temperature and may also differ in humidity . Wind shear in the horizontal occurs near these boundaries . Cold fronts feature narrow bands of thunderstorms and severe weather , and may be preceded by squall lines and dry lines . Cold fronts are sharper surface boundaries with more significant horizontal wind shear than warm fronts . When a front becomes stationary , it can degenerate into a line which separates regions of differing wind speed , known as a shear line , though the wind direction across the front normally remains constant . In the tropics , tropical waves move from east to west across the Atlantic and eastern Pacific basins . Directional and speed shear can occur across the axis of stronger tropical waves , as northerly winds precede the wave axis and southeast winds are seen behind the wave axis . Horizontal wind shear can also occur along local land breeze and sea breeze boundaries .",

  "By definition , in a Hilbert space any Cauchy sequence converges to a limit . Conversely , finding a sequence of functions fn with desirable properties that approximates a given limit function , is equally crucial . Early analysis , in the guise of the Taylor approximation , established an approximation of differentiable functions f by polynomials . By the Stone – Weierstrass theorem , every continuous function on [ a , b ] can be approximated as closely as desired by a polynomial . A similar approximation technique by trigonometric functions is commonly called Fourier expansion , and is much applied in engineering , see below . More generally , and more conceptually , the theorem yields a simple description of what \" basic functions \" , or , in abstract Hilbert spaces , what basic vectors suffice to generate a Hilbert space H , in the sense that the closure of their span ( i.e. , finite linear combinations and limits of those ) is the whole space . Such a set of functions is called a basis of H , its cardinality is known as the Hilbert space dimension . Not only does the theorem exhibit suitable basis functions as sufficient for approximation purposes , but together with the Gram @-@ Schmidt process , it enables one to construct a basis of orthogonal vectors . Such orthogonal bases are the Hilbert space generalization of the coordinate axes in finite @-@ dimensional Euclidean space .",

  "In North America the commemoration was at first paid scant attention , but the arrest of two boys caught lighting bonfires on 5 November 1662 in Boston suggests , in historian James Sharpe 's view , that \" an underground tradition of commemorating the Fifth existed \" . In parts of North America it was known as Pope Day , celebrated mainly in colonial New England , but also as far south as Charleston . In Boston , founded in 1630 by Puritan settlers led by John Winthrop , an early celebration was held in 1685 , the same year that James II assumed the throne . Fifty years later , again in Boston , a local minister wrote \" a Great number of people went over to Dorchester neck where at night they made a Great Bonfire and plaid off many fireworks \" , although the day ended in tragedy when \" 4 young men coming home in a Canoe were all Drowned . \" Ten years later the raucous celebrations were the cause of considerable annoyance to the upper classes and a special Riot Act was passed , to prevent \" riotous tumultuous and disorderly assemblies of more than three persons , all or any of them armed with Sticks , Clubs or any kind of weapons , or disguised with vizards , or painted or discolored faces , on in any manner disguised , having any kind of imagery or pageantry , in any street , lane , or place in Boston . \" With inadequate resources , however , Boston 's authorities were powerless to enforce the Act . In the 1740s gang violence became common , with groups of Boston residents battling for the honour of burning the pope 's effigy . But by the mid @-@ 1760s these riots had subsided , and as colonial America moved towards revolution , the class rivalries featured during Pope Day gave way to anti @-@ British sentiment . In author Alfred Young 's view , Pope Day provided the \" scaffolding , symbolism , and leadership \" for resistance to the Stamp Act in 1764 – 65 , forgoing previous gang rivalries in favour of unified resistance to Britain .",

  "Foot binding is the process in which the arch of a woman 's feet is broken and the toes are wrapped up against the foot to create a smaller looking foot with an acute arch . These \" fists of flesh \" were seen as attractive and arousing for men and the practice was passed down as a prerequisite to marriage from mother to daughter across generations . Special shoes were made to accentuate the small size of the women 's feet . This process was painful and often confined women to their rooms . Few lower class women were able to have their feet bound because they needed to be able to walk normally to accomplish house work . Bound feet came to be an indication of high class and wealth for women . Chinese male reformers during the imperialism period recognized the liberation of the Chinese women as something necessary for their own sake . The humiliation that China had gone through on an international level was turned on the Chinese “ women ” . Naturally , the foot binding was recognized as “ national shame , ” and people found it as a serious problem to be disappeared , thus raging anti @-@ footbinding campaigns in the 1890s to the 1900s . Moreover , the new government that came in after the 1911 revolution banned foot binding practice . Thus , it started to disappear in the coastal areas in 1900 to 1920 .

When creating La Cousine Bette , however , he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece , without viewing a single proof . The book was serialized in Le Constitutionnel from 8 October to 3 December , and Balzac rushed to keep up with the newspaper 's rapid printing schedule . He produced an average of eight pages each day , but was struck by the unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved . Balzac was paid 12 @,@ 836 francs for the series , which was later published with Le Cousin Pons as a twelve @-@ volume book by Chiendowski and Pétion . The first collected edition of La Cousine Bette was organized into 132 chapters , but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection La Comédie humaine in 1848 .",

  "Greg Retallack 's hypothesis that Ediacaran organisms were lichens is not widely accepted by the scientific community . He argues that the fossils are not as squashed as known fossil jellyfish , and their relief is closer to compressed woody branches whose compaction can be estimated as compressed cylinders . He points out the chitinous walls of lichen colonies would provide a similar resistance to compaction , and claims the large size of the organisms ( up to 1 @.@ 5 metres long , far larger than any of the preserved burrows ) also hints against classification with animals . Finally , Ediacaran fossils from classic localities of the Flinders Ranges have been found in growth position within red calcareous and gypsiferous paleosols , interpreted as soils of well @-@ drained temperate desert soils . Such habitats limit interpretive options for fractal Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia to lichenised or unlichenised fungi , but other Ediacaran fossils could have been slime moulds or microbial colonies .",

On his visits he took photographs of archaeological sites , which were stored in his archive , and he also obtained aerial photographs of archaeological sites taken by the Royal Air Force . In this he was aided by regional antiquarian societies and by his correspondents , whom he called his \" ferrets \" . In 1921 , the Ordnance Survey published Crawford 's work , \" Notes for Beginners \" , in which he explained how amateur archaeologists could identify traces of old monuments , roads , and agricultural activity in the landscape . He also began producing \" period maps \" in which archaeological sites were marked ; the first of these was on Roman Britain , and featured Roman roads and settlements . First published in 1924 , it soon sold out , resulting in a second edition in 1928 . He followed this with a range of further maps in the 1930s : ' England in the Seventeenth Century ' , ' Celtic Earthworks of Salisbury Plain ' , ' Neolithic Wessex ' , and ' Britain in the Dark Ages ' . Although his position had initially been precarious , in 1926 it was made permanent , despite the reluctance of the Treasury , which financed the OS at the time . By 1938 , he had been able to persuade the OS to employ an assistant , W. F. Grimes , to aid him in his work .",

These are all L @-@ stereoisomers ( \" left @-@ handed \" isomers ) , although a few D @-@ amino acids ( \" right @-@ handed \" ) occur in bacterial envelopes , as a neuromodulator ( D @-@ serine ) , and in some antibiotics . Twenty of the proteinogenic amino acids are encoded directly by triplet codons in the genetic code and are known as \" standard \" amino acids . The other three ( \" non @-@ standard \" or \" non @-@ canonical \" ) are selenocysteine ( present in many noneukaryotes as well as most eukaryotes , but not coded directly by DNA ) , pyrrolysine ( found only in some archea and one bacterium ) and N @-@ formylmethionine ( which is often the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria , mitochondria , and chloroplasts ) . Pyrrolysine and selenocysteine are encoded via variant codons ; for example , selenocysteine is encoded by stop codon and SECIS element . Codon – tRNA combinations not found in nature can also be used to \" expand \" the genetic code and create novel proteins known as alloproteins incorporating non @-@ proteinogenic amino acids .",

The inclusion of Melby and Harriman was regarded by some at the time as a Soviet attempt to lend official weight to their propaganda . Melby 's report noted the deficiencies in the Soviet case : problematic witnesses ; attempts to discourage questioning of the witnesses ; statements of the witnesses obviously being given as a result of rote memorization ; and that \" the show was put on for the benefit of the correspondents \" . Nevertheless , Melby , at the time , felt that on balance the Russian case was convincing . Harriman 's report reached the same conclusion and after the war both were asked to explain why their conclusions seemed to be at odds with their findings , with the suspicion that the conclusions were what the State Department wanted to hear . The journalists were less impressed and not totally convinced by the staged Soviet demonstration .",

In the Early Classic , an ajaw was the ruler of a city . Later , with increasing social complexity , the ajaw was a member of the ruling class and a major city could have more than one , each ruling over different districts .

The lower church permits smaller groups of the community to assemble for worship and houses the Lady Chapel , the Saint Basil Byzantine Chapel , the former offices of Campus Ministry ( relocated to Cushing Center ) , and meeting rooms . The Lower Church is the location of the weekly 9 p.m. Mass held on Wednesday nights . The original monastery was Alumni Hall . An interim monastery existed between 1919 and 1955 in what is now Joseph Hall , adjacent to Alumni Hall . The current monastery , built in 1955 , is staffed with only a cook , as the monks perform all other tasks such as cleaning , maintenance and upkeep . Having four floors , including a basement , the monastery can house up to one hundred monks ; as of 2012 approximately 30 rooms were filled . The Dean of the College and several members of the board of trustees live in the monastery , as they are practicing Benedictine monks .

The new wave @-@ styled \" Lost \" is about a perplexed addict , who hopes for a better life for him and his drug @-@ cooking girlfriend . \" Monks \" , a funk rock song , is about finding nirvana and deals with topics such as casual sex and devout religion in a narrative that shifts from an exciting concert to a metaphorical jungle . \" Bad Religion \" features melodramatic , orchestral music and a series of figures , including strings , handclaps , marching band snare drums , and mournful organ chords . The lyrics follow an emotional confession to a taxi driver by a narrator brooding over a secretive intimate relationship . Music journalist Alexis Petridis asserted that the song \" repurpos [ es ] the battle between religion and lust that 's been at the heart of soul music since it ceded from gospel \" .",

  "Though the film is presumed lost , a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from November 19 , 1910 . It states : \" Paul and Virginia are two young lovers who have grown up together from babyhood . Their widowed mothers lived near each other in rude cottages , on an island in the Indies , on which there are few inhabitants . Here the children are reared , knowing no play fellows but each other . When Virginia is 16 years of age , her mother receives a letter from a wealthy aunt in Paris , who offers to make Virginia her heir and give her a good education , providing Virginia will , in the future , make her aunt 's home her own . Virginia 's mother , having lost her own fortune through marrying against the will of her family , feels that she must not let her daughter suffer the poverty that she has been compelled to endure . She accordingly insists upon Virginia 's acceptance of her wealthy relatives offer . Virginia thereupon sets sail for France , leaving Paul broken @-@ hearted at her departure . Virginia tries to be a dutiful niece to her aunt , who is very old and sickly , although she longs to return to her humble home and Paul , whom she dearly loves . When , however , the aunt insists that she marry a rich nobleman , Virginia refuses ; her aunt disowns the girl and sends her back to the island home . Virginia 's ship arrives at the Indies during a hurricane , and although a cable 's length from shore , it sinks before help can reach it , and Virginia is drowned . Paul witnesses her death from the shore , and almost loses his own life in a vain attempt to save her . \"",

  "When the QIZ program came into being in 1996 , observers regarded it as a vehicle to support the development of peaceful relations and normalization of commercial ties between Israel and the two Arab states ( Jordan and Egypt ) with which it had signed peace treaties . In both cases , however , a tenuous peace continues to prevail between Israel and the two Arab states . Since the conclusion of the Jordan – Israel peace treaty in October 1994 , large numbers of Jordanians , particularly fundamentalists , those of Palestinian origin , and members of the professional unions continue to oppose normalization with Israel and resist the expansion of commercial relations .

  "\" My government was returned to power on a clear issue and with a definite mission ... to introduce measures for the preservation of industrial peace \" , Bruce declared during his second term , and called a referendum to amend the Australian Constitution and bring industrial relations under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commonwealth . Attempts to amend the constitution for this purpose had been rejected narrowly in 1911 , 1913 and 1919 , but against a background of ongoing industrial strife , Bruce made clear the problems of mixed jurisdiction , confusing dual @-@ awards , and insufficient regulatory and enforcement powers at the Commonwealth level . Controversially , he also formulated an \" essential services \" question to be put at the same time , giving the government the power to protect the public from any \" actual or probable disruption to essential services \" . These proposals drew hostile reception from many quarters – even from future conservative prime minister Robert Menzies – and both the Australian Labor Party and conservative groups were divided in opinion on the amendments , with the ALP eventually taking no fixed position on the questions . But by September the issue had drawn so much controversy and ill @-@ feeling that it was no surprise for many commentators that the proposals failed to attract sufficient popular support to overcome the high bar for constitutional change .",

  "Most parts of the fortress were finished during the First World War , and many minor works were started and completed during the course of the war . Even though Sweden remained neutral during the First and Second World War , the start and outcome of both had large impact on the fortress . Finland 's independence during the First World War created a buffer state between Sweden and Imperial Russia 's successor state , the Soviet Union , which radically changed the strategic value of northern Sweden , put the usefulness of Boden Fortress into question . Only the most basic needs were satisfied during the interwar period ; even apparent needs — based on the experiences from the war — such as better air defence and fortifications to halt or temporarily impede attacks by armoured forces were neglected . Thanks to local commanders , construction of new fortifications and improvements to already existing ones were done with the help of garrisoned troops . Engineer companies built new shelters and trenches as training , and the telephone network was improved and completed by the garrisoned telegraph company . This cut the cost drastically as the only expenditure was the needed material .",

  "The spotted hyena is a highly successful animal , being the most common large carnivore in Africa . Its success is due in part to its adaptability and opportunism ; it is primarily a hunter but may also scavenge , with the capacity to eat and digest skin , bone and other animal waste . In functional terms , the spotted hyena makes the most efficient use of animal matter of all African carnivores . The spotted hyena displays greater plasticity in its hunting and foraging behaviour than other African carnivores ; it hunts alone , in small parties of 2 – 5 individuals or in large groups . During a hunt , spotted hyenas often run through ungulate herds in order to select an individual to attack . Once selected , their prey is chased over long distance , often several kilometres , at speeds of up to 60 km / h .",

Except for the primitive Mesothelae , of which the Liphistiidae are the sole surviving family , spiders have the much more centralized nervous system that is typical of arachnids : all the ganglia of all segments behind the esophagus are fused , so that the cephalothorax is largely filled with nervous tissue and there are no ganglia in the abdomen ; in the Mesothelae , the ganglia of the abdomen and the rear part of the cephalothorax remain unfused .",

  "Kane Summit Hospital , as a public hospital , received charitable grants from the State of Pennsylvania . The tight family control of the hospital led to complaints from local physicians , who claimed that they were not able to freely use the hospital . Patients were admitted on condition that Evan O 'Neill Kane , as the chief surgeon , had the final say in their treatment . The complaining physicians felt that they alone should be the judge of the proper treatment of their own patients and found this condition unacceptable . In February 1908 , formal complaints to the Pennsylvania Board of Charity Commissioners resulted in an investigation . The complainants were requesting that the Hospital grant should be withdrawn so this was a serious matter for the hospital , but both Evan and his assistant Thomas L. Kane were away in Florida at the time . Answering the charges fell to their brother Elisha Kent Kane , who was on the board of management of the hospital , but not the medical staff , and the hospital superintendent Dr. M. J. Hays . The hospital admission rules were changed as a result of the investigation . The commissioners found that the Kanes were not using their position to make unacceptable profits from the hospital ; on the contrary , they had made large donations , but recommended that stock holding in the hospital should be more broadly extended outside the Kane family . The commissioners also requested that the private practice offices of Evan and Thomas Kane be moved outside the hospital . Although the furnishing of these offices were paid for by the occupants , the cost of fuel , water and lighting was borne by the hospital .",

One of his first significant acts after the rebellion was to marry Anne of Bohemia , daughter of the Holy Roman Emperor ( King of Bohemia Charles IV ) and his wife Elisabeth of Pomerania , on 20 January 1382 . The marriage had diplomatic significance ; in the division of Europe caused by the Great Schism , Bohemia and the Empire were seen as potential allies against France in the ongoing Hundred Years ' War . Nonetheless , the marriage was not popular in England . Despite great sums of money awarded to the Empire , the political alliance never resulted in any military victories .

  "Concussion involves diffuse ( as opposed to focal ) brain injury , meaning that the dysfunction occurs over a widespread area of the brain rather than in a particular spot . It is thought to be a milder type of diffuse axonal injury , because axons may be injured to a minor extent due to stretching . Animal studies in which primates were concussed have revealed damage to brain tissues such as small petechial hemorrhages and axonal injury . Axonal damage has been found in the brains of concussion sufferers who died from other causes , but inadequate blood flow to the brain due to other injuries may have contributed . Findings from a study of the brains of deceased NFL athletes who received concussions suggest that lasting damage is done by such injuries . This damage , the severity of which increases with the cumulative number of concussions sustained , can lead to a variety of other health issues .",

Consultant David Mirkin suggested that the animators should add \" some funny things \" to the episode to \" spice it up \" , such as the gorilla suit that one of the bank employees wear . After the audio recording of the script by the Simpsons cast , the episode ended up too long . Weinstein said one of the reasons for it was that Krusty talks very slowly , which drags out the time . They were only allowed to send twenty minutes worth of audio to Film Roman for them to animate , but the audio track for the episode was twenty @-@ six minutes long . American actor Bob Newhart guest starred in the episode as himself . Oakley said Newhart also talked very slowly and they had to cut out more than half of his recorded lines . Many of the writers were big fans of Newhart and everybody wanted to see him record his lines . Oakley and Weinstein decided to shut down production so that the whole writing staff could go to the recording studio . The episode was recorded in a big room so everyone had to be really quiet . It took Newhart two and a half minutes to record his first take , and , as no one was allowed to laugh during that time , there was an \" explosion \" of laughter in the room when he finished . Parts of Phil Hartman 's appearance as Troy McClure were also cut from the episode due to time limits .",

  "Colletid bees of the genus Leioproctus , subgenus Cladocerapis , forage exclusively on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia . Bees of the subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus also feed only on Persoonia flowers but do not appear to be effective pollinators . Recorded species include the longtongue bees Leioproctus ( Cladocerapis ) carinatifrons , L. incanescens , and L. speculiferus , as well as Leioproctus filamentosa and Exoneura species . The European honeybee ( Apis mellifera ) is a common visitor to flowers , although its effectiveness as a pollinator is unclear . Persoonia lanceolata is an obligate outcrosser , that is , flowers need to be pollinated by pollen from other plants , and honeybees tend to forage more on different flowers of the same plant than between plants , as native bees do . Their abundance might be impacting the pollination success of native bees in this and other Persoonia species .",

  "With regard to sexual activity in particular , the need or desire for masturbation is commonly referred to as sex drive by asexuals and they disassociate it from sexual attraction and being sexual ; asexuals who masturbate generally consider it to be a normal product of the human body and not a sign of latent sexuality , and may not even find it pleasurable . Some asexual men are unable to get an erection and sexual activity by attempting penetration is impossible for them . Asexuals also differ in their feelings toward performing sex acts : some are indifferent and may have sex for the benefit of a romantic partner ; others are more strongly averse to the idea , though they do not typically dislike people for having sex .",

  "Trillium grandiflorum has long been thought to self @-@ pollinate based on the fact that pollinators had rarely been observed visiting the plants and because there is low variation in chromosomal banding patterns . This has been strongly challenged , as other studies have shown high pollination rates by bumblebees and very low success of self @-@ pollination in controlled experiments , implying that they are in fact self @-@ incompatible . Several ovules of a given individual often fail to produce seeds . One contributing factor is pollen limitation , and one study showed that open pollinated plants had 56 % of their ovules produce seeds , while in hand pollinated individuals the figure was 66 % . Plants with reduced exposure to pollinators were 33 % to 50 % less likely to produce fruits than those that were , while hand pollinated individuals showed a 100 % fruit set ( though these fruits did not contain a 100 % seed set ) . Plant resources were shown to be a limiting factor in seed production : when pollen was in abundance , larger plants had a significantly greater seed to ovule ratio than smaller ones . The overall suboptimal seed to ovule ratios suggest that Trillium grandiflorum has evolved to maximize reproductive success in the face of highly stochastic pollination , where some plants may only be visited by a single pollinator in a season .",

  "Aquinas supported Augustine 's view that evil is a privation of goodness , maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good . The existence of this evil , Aquinas believed , can be completely explained by free will . Faced with the assertion that humans would have been better off without free will , he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world , and so individuals are responsible for their sin . Good is the cause of evil , but only owing to fault on the part of the agent . In his theodicy , to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God 's creation , because God 's creation lacked nothing . Aquinas noted that , although goodness makes evil possible , it does not necessitate evil . This means that God ( who is good ) is not cast as the cause of evil , because evil arises out of a defect in an agent , and God is seen to be without defect . Philosopher Eleonore Stump , considering Aquinas ' commentary on the Book of Job , argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering : it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans that they still have the propensity to commit evil . Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it , and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur . Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil , Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen , rather than willing it . He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil , but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality . Like Augustine , Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will .",

  "Around 1550 the mounting conflict seems to have reached a turning point with the Zafikasimambo noble family rising to power in Matitana following the family leader 's marriage to a local woman . Historical texts tie the lineage of the family 's leader , Zafikazimambobe , to Anteony noble Ramarohala , who had settled there at least three generations before . Other historical sources confirm however that the genealogy described in these texts is not factual , and that the Zafikazimambo family had only newly arrived and so had no demonstrable descent from local nobles . Rather , these texts suggest that it took over three generations for the Antemoro to successfully integrate into the society through intermarriage and other means , and also reflect an awareness among the Antemoro of the importance of local caste and lineage traditions and their need to find a place within them . Upon rising to power , the Zafikasimambo clan absorbed the ritual privileges of the former Zafiraminia clan and had established themselves as the premier ombiasy ( wise men ) who practiced astrology and served as scribes ; they regularly left the Antemoro homeland to provide their services where needed . These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities , further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it . The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct sombily ( ritual sacrifice ) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area . To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia , they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas . In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom . They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom within a short time after landing on the island .",
  "Peng was one of the first public figures singled out for persecution in 1966 by the Cultural Revolution Group . The Party Secretariat attempted to shield Peng , but Mao 's wife , Jiang Qing , took a personal interest in Peng 's persecution and directed Red Guards in Sichuan to find Peng in Chengdu , arrest him , and deliver him to Beijing to be persecuted . Local Red Guards in Chengdu were not enthusiastic to follow these orders : they visited Peng 's house on December 22 , 1966 and attempted to intimidate Peng by informing him of the recent arrests of some of his friends and comrades , and of the imminent arrests of Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping . Because of local Red Guards ' lack of enthusiasm to carry out Jiang Qing 's orders , a more radical Red Guard leader , Wang Dabin , arrived in Chengdu on December 24 , and denounced his local comrades as \" rightists \" and \" traitors \" for delaying Peng 's arrest . The Red Guards then abducted Peng in the early morning of December 25 , put him in chains , and ransacked his house . Peng 's bodyguards arrived to save Peng at around 4 : 00 AM , but were already too late .",

  "It has been suggested that the dehors theory is based on a misunderstanding of the operation of the Wills Act . In particular , whilst the term \" will \" is commonly used to refer to a specific document , the WIlls Act is designed to cover all documents that are to take effect after the testator 's death . Indeed , the formality requirements of the Wills Act created the need for a single document , like the one commonly referred to . Therefore to refer to an arrangement as outside the Wills Act because it is not in the single document commonly referred to is incorrect . The response has been to view the secret trust as a disposition inter vivos ( \" between the living \" ) rather than testamentary in nature . Although the testator is unlikely to consider the trust having come into existence at the time of the execution of the will , whether a disposition is inter vivos is a question for the courts . However , other types of inter vivos trust are incapable of binding after @-@ acquired property or operating so as to automatically bind such property as and when it is received . No separate declaration of trust is required in the case of property acquired after the execution of a will for it to form part of a secret trust .

After a detailed study , three researchers determined that two typhoons , Angela in 1995 and Gay in 1992 , registered higher Dvorak numbers than Tip , and concluded that one or both of the two may have therefore been more intense .

  "The isotopes 134 and 137 are present in the biosphere in small amounts from human activities and which differs between locations . Radiocaesium does not accumulate in the body as effectively as many other fission products ( such as radioiodine and radiostrontium ) . About 10 % of absorbed radiocaesium washes out of the body relatively quickly in sweat and urine . The remaining 90 % has a biological half @-@ life between 50 and 150 days . Radiocaesium follows potassium and tends to accumulate in plant tissues , including fruits and vegetables . Plants absorb caesium differently , some do not absorb it much , and some take it large amounts , sometimes displaying great resistance to it . It is also well @-@ documented that mushrooms from contaminated forests accumulate radiocaesium ( caesium @-@ 137 ) in their fungal sporocarps . Accumulation of caesium @-@ 137 in lakes has been a high concern after the Chernobyl disaster .

  "The Egyptians called their hieroglyphs \" words of god \" and reserved their use for exalted purposes , such as communicating with divinities and spirits of the dead through funerary texts . Each hieroglyphic word both represented a specific object and embodied the essence of that object , recognizing it as divinely made and belonging within the greater cosmos . Through acts of priestly ritual , like burning incense , the priest allowed spirits and deities to read the hieroglyphs decorating the surfaces of temples . In funerary texts beginning in and following the Twelfth dynasty , the Egyptians believed that disfiguring , and even omitting certain hieroglyphs , brought consequences , either good or bad , for a deceased tomb occupant whose spirit relied on the texts as a source of nourishment in the afterlife . Mutilating the hieroglyph of a venomous snake , or other dangerous animal , removed a potential threat .

  "By the middle of the 18th century , law enforcement in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals . In 1740 , the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier ( Banal Frontier ) , specifically its Karlovac and Varaždin Generalcies .

  "Amanita regalis is poisonous . A case of poisoning was reported from Finland , where three individuals believed they had consumed the edible parasol mushroom Macrolepiota procera .

Their plan was to find inspiration from the recording space and use it to musically create atmosphere , much like they did with Slane Castle for The Unforgettable Fire sessions in 1984 .

  "The scheme proposed by the pope was for twelve large figures of the Apostles to occupy the pendentives . However , Michelangelo negotiated for a grander , much more complex scheme and was finally permitted , in his own words , \" to do as I liked \" . His scheme for the ceiling eventually comprised some three hundred figures and took four years to execute , being completed in 1512 . It is unknown and is the subject of much speculation among art historians as to whether Michelangelo was really able to \" do as he liked \" . It has been suggested that the Augustinian friar and cardinal , Giles of Viterbo , was a consultant for the theological aspect of the work . Many writers consider that Michelangelo had the intellect , the Biblical knowledge , and the powers of invention to have devised the scheme himself . This is supported by Ascanio Condivi 's statement that Michelangelo read and reread the Old Testament while he was painting the ceiling , drawing his inspiration from the words of the scripture , rather than from the established traditions of sacral art .

Something was definitely up when Arthur said , \" It 's already over . \" We all thought so because we 've heard him say those words before . We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line , confused about its meaning . We could have chalked it up to the fact that Arthur was accepting his own death , but Dexter 's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here . Of course , the real bitch here is that Dexter , having dispatched of Trinity officially , now can 't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance . The scene stands quite beautifully on its own , but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done . We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita 's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it 's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe , by the end , that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit . His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system , which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb 's tenacity and expert detective work . \" Also , IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter 's Top 10 Kills saying that \" This was the murder that America was clamoring for .

The next day , a low pressure area formed between the Chagos Archipelago and Diego Garcia , and on January 19 the system developed into a tropical disturbance after convection increased . Following further organization , the system intensified into Tropical Storm Edwina on January 20 while moving generally westward . Increasing wind shear prevented significant strengthening initially , but Edwina was able to intensify more on January 21 . On January 23 , the JTWC upgraded the storm to the equivalent of a minimal hurricane on the same day that MFR upgraded Edwina to tropical cyclone status . On the next day , the JTWC estimated the cyclone attained peak winds of 205 km / h ( 125 mph ) , after Edwina developed a well @-@ defined 75 km ( 47 mi ) wide eye . On January 26 , the MFR estimated that the cyclone reached peak 10 @-@ minute winds of 170 km / h ( 105 mph ) , making Edwina the strongest storm of the season . Around that time , the cyclone turned more to the south around a large ridge , maintaining peak winds through January 27 . By that time , the eye became large and ragged while passing halfway between Rodrigues and St. Brandon . On January 27 , Edwina passed about 220 km ( 140 mi ) east of Mauritius . On the next day , increased wind shear caused marked weakening , quickly destroying the eye and lowering the winds below tropical cyclone force . On January 29 , Edwina ceased existing as a tropical system , although its remnants persisted several more days , affecting Île Amsterdam in the south @-@ central Indian Ocean on February 2 .",
