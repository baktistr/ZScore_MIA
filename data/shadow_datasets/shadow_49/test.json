  "On 21 July , Izetbegović and Tuđman signed the \" Agreement on Friendship and Cooperation between the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia \" in Zagreb , Croatia . The agreement allowed them to \" cooperate in opposing [ the Serb ] aggression \" and coordinate military efforts . It placed the HVO under the command of the ARBiH . Cooperation was inharmonious , but enabled the transportation of weapons to ARBiH through Croatia in spite of the UN sanctioned arms embargo , reopening channels blocked by Boban . It established \" economic , financial , cultural , educational , scientific and religious cooperation \" between the signatories . It also stipulated that Bosnian Croats hold dual citizenship for both Bosnia and Herzegovina and for Croatia .

  "Two other factors have often been cited in Stroma 's depopulation : the building of the nuclear power station at nearby Dounreay in the 1950s , which created many new jobs on the mainland , and in the same decade the construction of a harbour on Stroma on which many islanders were employed . Although it has been claimed that this gave the islanders the incentive ( and the means ) to leave , local historian Donald A. Young points out that of islanders who left after 1945 , only one went directly from Stroma to Dounreay . Most of the rest either continued fishing or carried on crofting on the mainland , while others found alternative jobs . Some ex @-@ islanders eventually found jobs at Dounreay , but they had already moved to the mainland for work or education .",

  "Reculver may have remained home to a religious community into the 10th century , despite its vulnerability to Viking attacks . It is possible that the abbot and community of Reculver took refuge from the Vikings in Canterbury , as the abbess and community of Lyminge did in 804 . A monk of Reculver named Ymar was recorded as a saint in the early 15th century by Thomas Elmham , who found the name in a martyrology , and wrote that Ymar was buried in St John ’ s church , Margate : Ymar was probably killed by Vikings in the 10th century , and hence regarded as a martyr . The Church in East Kent seems broadly to have \" preserved its primary ... character against all the odds \" , but evidence for the monastery at Reculver is lacking : by the 11th century the monastery had \" dropped out of sight entirely \" . The last abbot is recorded as Wenredus : although it is unknown when he was abbot , it must have been after 890 – possibly 905 – when the name of Abbot Beornhelm last appears in Anglo @-@ Saxon charters .

  "Since the conversion of London to Christianity in the early 7th century , the city 's dead had been buried in and around the local churches . With a limited amount of space for burials , the oldest graves were regularly exhumed to free space for new burials , and the remains of the previous occupants transferred to charnel houses for storage . From the 14th century onwards the charnel houses themselves were overwhelmed , and exhumed bones were scattered where they had been dug up or reburied in pits . Despite this practice , by the mid 17th century the city was running seriously short of burial space .

  "The NWOBHM triggered a renaissance in a stagnant rock genre , but took on heavy criticism for the excessive local media hype surrounding a legion of typically mediocre musicians . Detractors think that , unlike heavy metal of the preceding decades , their music was unoriginal and included no classic rock recordings . Nevertheless , these bands and their diverse output offered a blueprint that counterparts across the Western world would later emulate and expand . The collision of styles that characterized the NWOBHM is now seen as key to the diversification of heavy metal in the second half of the 1980s into various subgenres that came to the fore in the 1990s . The stardom of Def Leppard in the US provided a catalyst for the growth of glam metal , just as bands like Angel Witch , Witchfynde , Cloven Hoof and especially Venom generated the music , lyrics , cover art and attitude that sparked black metal in its various forms in Europe and America . Motörhead , Iron Maiden , Raven , Tank , Venom and other minor groups are viewed as precursors of speed metal and thrash metal , two subgenres which carried forward the crossover with punk , incorporating elements of hardcore while amplifying volume , velocity and aggressive tone . Starting around 1982 , distant points such as North America , West Germany , and Brazil each became the locus of its own distinctive thrash metal scenes – East Coast and Bay Area , Teutonic , and Brazilian thrash metal . Their debt to the NWOBHM was acknowledged for example by Metallica 's Lars Ulrich , an active fan and avid collector of NWOBHM recordings and memorabilia . Under his influence , the set lists of Metallica 's early shows were filled with covers of British metal groups . The sound of the NWOBHM even \" cross @-@ pollinated \" a subgenre of punk , as UK 82 street punk bands like Discharge blended punk music with elements of metal .",

  "Despite the warlike customs of the Vikings , there was an element of fear surrounding death and what belonged to it . If the deceased was not buried and provided for properly , he might not find peace in the afterlife . The dead person could then visit the bereaved as a revenant or draugr . Such a sight was frightful and ominous and usually it was interpreted as a sign that additional family members would die . It was first and foremost in times of starvation , when communities were struck with a series of misfortunes , that rumours about revenants began to flourish . The sagas tell of drastic precautions being taken after a revenant had appeared . The dead person had to die anew ; a stake could be put through the corpse , or its head might be cut off in order to stop the deceased from finding its way back to the living .",

  "The etymology of St Kilda , a small archipelago west of the Outer Hebrides , and its main island Hirta is very complex . No saint is known by the name of Kilda and various theories have been proposed for the word 's origin , which dates from the late 16th century . Haswell @-@ Smith ( 2004 ) notes that the full name \" St Kilda \" first appears on a Dutch map dated 1666 , and that it may have been derived from Norse sunt kelda ( \" sweet wellwater \" ) or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring Tobar Childa was dedicated to a saint . ( Tobar Childa is a tautological placename , consisting of the Gaelic and Norse words for well , i.e. \" well well \" ) .

  "The Japanese Hydrographic and Oceanographic Department of the Japanese Coast Guard has claimed that the name East Sea is confusing and unsuitable as an international geographic name , because the local name for a variety of seas can be translated into English as East Sea . Examples include Dōng Hǎi ( 东海 ) , the Chinese name for the East China Sea ; Biển Đông , the Vietnamese name for the South China Sea ; and the Baltic Sea , which means East Sea in several European languages such as German ( Ostsee ) , Swedish ( Östersjön ) and Finnish ( Itämeri ) . East Sea is officially used as an English name for the water by the Government of Vietnam . Thus the Government of Vietnam uses East Sea for South China Sea in its English publications .

  "Trillium grandiflorum has long been thought to self @-@ pollinate based on the fact that pollinators had rarely been observed visiting the plants and because there is low variation in chromosomal banding patterns . This has been strongly challenged , as other studies have shown high pollination rates by bumblebees and very low success of self @-@ pollination in controlled experiments , implying that they are in fact self @-@ incompatible . Several ovules of a given individual often fail to produce seeds . One contributing factor is pollen limitation , and one study showed that open pollinated plants had 56 % of their ovules produce seeds , while in hand pollinated individuals the figure was 66 % . Plants with reduced exposure to pollinators were 33 % to 50 % less likely to produce fruits than those that were , while hand pollinated individuals showed a 100 % fruit set ( though these fruits did not contain a 100 % seed set ) . Plant resources were shown to be a limiting factor in seed production : when pollen was in abundance , larger plants had a significantly greater seed to ovule ratio than smaller ones . The overall suboptimal seed to ovule ratios suggest that Trillium grandiflorum has evolved to maximize reproductive success in the face of highly stochastic pollination , where some plants may only be visited by a single pollinator in a season .",

  "The central ideas behind \" Robbing the Cradle \" were conceived by Thief : Deadly Shadows project director Randy Smith in 2000 . Smith had designed a horror @-@ based level , \" Return to the Cathedral \" , in 1998 's Thief : The Dark Project . Although he had intended only to make it \" atmospheric and suspenseful \" , the level was widely held to be terrifying . In 2000 , Smith was in the process of being hired at Ion Storm to work on Deadly Shadows , and he was contacted by PC Gamer UK writer Kieron Gillen to discuss \" Return to the Cathedral \" . As the interview progressed via email , Smith developed a theory of horror design to retroactively explain the success of the level . His core concept was that players try to establish boundaries between safety and danger , and that fear results when these boundaries become unpredictable , or when the player is compelled to cross them \" of their own free will \" . Smith decided to consciously apply this theory in Deadly Shadows , and the result was \" Robbing the Cradle \" .",

DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson , however , gave the episode a more negative review , stating that it \" has its moments but never seems like one of the series ’ better programs . Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending . The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series . It starts well with Homer ’ s obsession with Reading Digest . After that , the show seems more erratic , and it remains pretty average overall . \"",

  "Only meat from particular species is permissible . Mammals that both chew their cud ( ruminate ) and have cloven hooves can be kosher . Animals with one characteristic but not the other ( the camel , the hyrax , and the hare because they have no cloven hooves , and the pig because it does not ruminate ) are specifically excluded ( Leviticus 11 : 3 – 8 ) . In 2008 , a rabbinical ruling determined that giraffes and their milk are eligible to be considered kosher . The giraffe has both split hooves and chews its cud , characteristics of animals considered kosher . Findings from 2008 show that giraffe milk curdles , meeting kosher standards . Although kosher , the giraffe is not slaughtered today because the process would be very costly .

  "At the start of the First World War the first schemes for international organisation to prevent future wars began to gain considerable public support , particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States . Goldsworthy Lowes Dickinson , a British political scientist , coined the term \" League of Nations \" in 1914 and drafted a scheme for its organisation . Together with Lord Bryce , he played a leading role in the founding of the group of internationalist pacifists known as the Bryce Group , later the League of Nations Union . The group became steadily more influential among the public and as a pressure group within the then governing Liberal Party . In Dickinson 's 1915 pamphlet After the War he wrote of his \" League of Peace \" as being essentially an organisation for arbitration and conciliation . He felt that the secret diplomacy of the early twentieth century had brought about war and thus could write that , \" the impossibility of war , I believe , would be increased in proportion as the issues of foreign policy should be known to and controlled by public opinion . \" The ‘ Proposals ’ of the Bryce Group were circulated widely , both in England and the US , where they had a profound influence on the nascent international movement .",

  "Nationalism had become a \" civic religion \" among the Finns by the end of 19th century , but their main goal , in particular during the First Period of Russification and the General strike of 1905 , was a return to the autonomy of 1809 – 1898 , not independence . Since 1809 , under the less uniform Russian rule , the domestic power of the Finns increased substantially , compared to the unitary Swedish regime . In economy the Grand Duchy benefited from an independent domestic state budget , own currency ( the markka , since 1860 ) and customs organization , and the industrial progress during 1860 – 1916 . The economy of the Grand Duchy was dependent on the huge Russian market , and separation from Russia would create a risk of losing Finland 's preferred position . The economic collapse of Russia and the political power struggle of the Finnish state during 1917 were among the key factors that brought sovereignty to the fore in Finland .",

  "Pownall 's work identified him as supportive of American liberty . Although he feared that Britain was losing control of its colonies , he wrote that the Americans were entitled to the same rights of representative government as their fellow subjects in England , Scotland , and Wales . At the same time , he insisted that the military protection that the colonists received from Britain created equally extensive obligations to help pay for some of the cost . He was also convinced of the need for a strong , central legislature capable of making common policies that would be binding for every member of the British empire , including the fractious provinces in North America . Pownall eventually decided that the only solution lay in creating an imperial parliament with representatives from both Britain and the colonies . Although he was not the only British commentator to embrace the idea of an imperial parliament , most Americans found it anathema , so much so that John Dickinson singled out his centralized plan of legislative reform for particular criticism in his influential Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania ( 1768 ) .",

Keith DeCandido , in his article for Tor.com , said it was difficult to give a fair review of the episode due to the Trill being explored in greater depth in Deep Space Nine , and the subsequent alterations made for that series compared to \" The Host \" . He said more generally of the episode that the romance felt rushed , and he would have liked to see the exploration of Riker 's feelings about his body being used to have sex with a friend . A further criticism was levelled at the ending , as Crusher stated that it was humans who have a problem with homosexuality rather than limiting it to be her own problem .

Upon arrival , Castro discovered that only 19 rebels had made it to their destination , the rest having been killed or captured . Setting up an encampment , the survivors included the Castros , Che Guevara , and Camilo Cienfuegos . They began launching raids on small army posts to obtain weaponry , and in January 1957 they overran the outpost at La Plata , treating any soldiers that they wounded but executing Chicho Osorio , the local mayoral ( land company overseer ) , who was despised by the local peasants and who boasted of killing one of Castro 's rebels . Osorio 's execution aided the rebels in gaining the trust of locals , although they largely remained unenthusiastic and suspicious of the revolutionaries .

  "Stowell 's article attracted intense attention , and placed Albert Victor among the most notable Ripper suspects , but his innocence was soon proven . Gull died before Albert Victor , and so could not have known about Albert Victor 's death . All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia , and given the timescale of syphilitic disease progression , it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis . The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure . While the timescale of disease progression is never absolute , for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888 , he would probably have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873 , six years before he visited the West Indies . Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution , when Albert Victor was serving in the British army , making regular public appearances , and visiting friends at country houses . Newspaper reports , Queen Victoria 's diary , family letters , and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public , or meeting foreign royalty , or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders .",

  "Catherine herself had been educated in astrology and astronomy . Though these were largely considered respectable subjects , Catherine 's biographer Leonie Frieda believes that it was her fascination with these subjects that has earned her the reputation history and her peers accorded her . Indeed , it has been suggested that Catherine educated her son , Henry III , in the dark arts , and that \" the two devoted themselves to sorceries that were scandals of the age \" . As a result , some ( more extreme ) authors believe Catherine to be the creator of the Black Mass , a Satanic inversion of the traditional Catholic Mass , although there is little to prove this aside from Jean Bodin 's account in his book De la démonomanie des sorciers . Nevertheless , Catherine was never formally accused or prosecuted despite the fact that her reign experienced the greatest number of prosecutions for Witchcraft in Italy . This lends some weight to the suggestion that people were labelled ' witches ' simply because they did not act the way a woman should ( humble and grateful ) , or simply to suit personal agendas . This may be particularly true for Catherine as an Italian woman ruling in France ; several historians argue that she was disliked by her French subjects , who labelled her \" the Italian woman \" . In any event , the rumours have made a mark on Catherine 's reputation over time , and there are now many dramaticised works about her involvement in the Occult .",

  "Although these acts helped empower courts to remedy violations of federal voting rights , strict legal standards made it difficult for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation .

This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state 's counties in a process that could last months . The Department 's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials , who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities , remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls , and resign so that voter registration ceased . Moreover , the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage .

  "Many of the free peasants of Anglo @-@ Saxon society appear to have lost status and become indistinguishable from the non @-@ free serfs .

The spread of towns and increase in nucleated settlements in the countryside , rather than scattered farms , was probably accelerated by the coming of the Normans to England . The lifestyle of the peasantry probably did not greatly change in the decades after 1066 . Although earlier historians argued that women became less free and lost rights with the conquest , current scholarship has mostly rejected this view . Little is known about women other than those in the landholding class , so no conclusions can be drawn about peasant women 's status after 1066 . Noblewomen appear to have continued to influence political life mainly through their kinship relationships .

  "James V was the first Scottish monarch to wear the closed imperial crown , in place of the open circlet of medieval kings , suggesting a claim to absolute authority within the kingdom . His diadem was reworked to include arches in 1532 , which were re @-@ added when it was reconstructed in 1540 in what remains the Crown of Scotland . The idea of imperial monarchy emphasised the dignity of the crown and included its role as a unifying national force , defending national borders and interest , royal supremacy over the law and a distinctive national church within the Catholic communion . New Monarchy can also be seen in the reliance of the crown on \" new men \" rather than the great magnates , the use of the clergy as a form of civil service , developing standing armed forces and a navy . Major intellectual figures in the Reformation included George Buchanan , whose works De Jure Regni apud Scotos ( 1579 ) and Rerum Scoticarum Historia ( 1582 ) were among the major texts outlining the case for resistance to tyrants . Buchanan was one of the young James VI 's tutors , but they failed to intellectually convince him of their ideas about limited monarchy . James asserted the concept of \" divine right \" , by which a king was appointed by God and thus gained a degree of sanctity . These ideas he passed on to Charles I , whose ability to compromise may have been undermined by them , helping to lead to his political difficulties . When he was executed , the Scottish Covenanters objected , but avoided advancing the sanctity of kings as a reason . In 1689 , when the Scottish Estates had to find a justification for deposing James VII , they turned to Buchanan 's argument on the contractual nature of monarchy in the Claim of Right .",

  "As the hydrogen fuel at the core of the progenitor of IK Pegasi B was consumed , it evolved into a red giant . The inner core contracted until hydrogen burning commenced in a shell surrounding the helium core . To compensate for the temperature increase , the outer envelope expanded to many times the radius it possessed as a main sequence star . When the core reached a temperature and density where helium could start to undergo fusion this star contracted and became what is termed a horizontal branch star . That is , it belonged to a group of stars that fall upon a roughly horizontal line on the H @-@ R diagram . The fusion of helium formed an inert core of carbon and oxygen .

  "Small spontaneous pneumothoraces do not always require treatment , as they are unlikely to proceed to respiratory failure or tension pneumothorax , and generally resolve spontaneously . This approach is most appropriate if the estimated size of the pneumothorax is small ( defined as < 50 % of the volume of the hemithorax ) , there is no breathlessness , and there is no underlying lung disease . It may be appropriate to treat a larger PSP conservatively if the symptoms are limited . Admission to hospital is often not required , as long as clear instructions are given to return to hospital if there are worsening symptoms . Further investigations may be performed as an outpatient , at which time X @-@ rays are repeated to confirm improvement , and advice given with regard to preventing recurrence ( see below ) .

  "The claim that all humans are due dignity and respect as autonomous agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed upon anyone , and that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society . Kant 's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely as a means to an end , leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices . Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they do not treat women as ends . Kant also believed that , because animals do not possess rationality , we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them . Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics : because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth , we must never lie , even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth .",

  "Whitby grew in size and wealth , extending its activities to include shipbuilding using local oak timber . In 1790 – 91 Whitby built 11 @,@ 754 tons of shipping , making it the third largest shipbuilder in England , after London and Newcastle . Taxes on imports entering the port raised money to improve and extend the town 's twin piers , improving the harbour and permitting further increases in trade . In 1753 the first whaling ship set sail to Greenland and by 1795 Whitby had become a major whaling port . The most successful year was 1814 when eight ships caught 172 whales , and the whaler , the Resolution 's catch produced 230 tons of oil . The carcases yielded 42 tons of whale bone used for ' stays ' which were used in the corsetry trade until changes in fashion made them redundant . Blubber was boiled to produce oil for use in lamps in four oil houses on the harbourside . Oil was used for street lighting until the spread of gas lighting reduced demand and the Whitby Whale Oil and Gas Company changed into the Whitby Coal and Gas Company . As the market for whale products fell , catches became too small to be economic and by 1831 only one whaling ship , the Phoenix , remained .",

The lawsuit was averted after the Library agreed to stop awarding the certificate .

  "Frakes considered the entrance of the Borg Queen — where her head , shoulders , and steel spine are lowered by cables and attached to her body — as the \" signature visual effect in the film \" . The scene was difficult to execute , taking ILM five months to finish . Jaeger devised a rig that would lower the actress on the set , and applied a prosthetic spine over a blue suit so that ILM could remove Krige 's lower body . This strategy enabled the filmmakers to incorporate as many live @-@ action elements as possible without resorting to further digital effects . To make the prosthetics appear at the proper angle when her lower body was removed , Krige extended her neck forward so it appeared in line with the spine . Knoll did not want it to seem that the Queen was on a hard , mechanical rig ; \" we wanted her to have the appropriate ' float ' , \" he explained . Using separate motion control passes on the set , Knoll shot the lower of the upper torso and the secondary sequence with Krige 's entire body . A digital version of the Borg body suit was used for the lowering sequence , at which point the image was morphed back to the real shot of Krige 's body . The animated claws of the suit were created digitally as well using a detailed model . As reference to the animators , the shot required Krige to realistically portray \" the strange pain or satisfaction of being reconnected to her body \" .",

  "In 1965 , Warner surprised many industry observers when he purchased the rights to Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? , Edward Albee 's searing play about a destructive marriage . From the beginning , the project was beset by controversy . Ernest Lehman 's script , which was extremely faithful to Albee 's play , stretched the U.S. film industry 's Production Code to the limit . Jack Valenti , who just assumed leadership of the Motion Picture Association of America , recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him \" uneasy \" . \" I was uncomfortable with the thought that this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film , in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight , \" Valenti wrote . Meanwhile , Lehman and the film 's director , Mike Nichols , battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white . These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an \" Adults only \" label and restrict tickets sales accordingly , all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction . At this , the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film , The Pawnbroker — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality , which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively . Upon its release , Who 's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? was embraced by audiences and critics alike . It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966 .",

  "The last major overhaul of the metric system was in 1960 when the International System of Units ( SI ) was formally published as a coherent set of units of measure . SI is structured around seven base units that have apparently \" arbitrary \" definitions and another twenty units that are derived from these base units . Although the units themselves form a coherent system , the definitions do not . The proposal before the CIPM seeks to remedy this by using the fundamental quantities of nature as the basis for deriving the base units . This will mean , amongst other things , that the prototype kilogram will cease to be used as the definitive replica of the kilogram . The second and the metre are already defined in such a manner .",
  "Plutonium @-@ 238 is potentially more efficient isotope for nuclear reactors , since it has smaller critical mass than uranium @-@ 235 , but it continues to release much thermal energy ( 0 @.@ 56 W / g ) by decay even when the fission chain reaction is stopped by control rods . Its application is limited by the high price ( about 1000 USD / g ) . This isotope has been used in thermopiles and water distillation systems of some space satellites and stations . So Galileo and Apollo spacecraft ( e.g. Apollo 14 ) had heaters powered by kilogram quantities of plutonium @-@ 238 oxide ; this heat is also transformed into electricity with thermopiles . The decay of plutonium @-@ 238 produces relatively harmless alpha particles and is not accompanied by gamma @-@ irradiation .

  "When The Rolling Stones announced their 1969 American tour , their first in the U.S. for several years , an enterprising bootlegger known as \" Dub \" decided to record some of the shows .

  "Although the IDA 's funds are now regularly replenished , this does not happen without some financial and political challenges for the donating countries . When donor countries convene to negotiate the replenishments , there is often intense discussion about redefining the association 's goals and objectives or even about reforming the IDA . Due to delays in the United States Congress impeding the approval of IDA funding , the association 's members implemented a set of policy triggers outlining the commitment threshold necessary for replenishment to take effect . The threshold imposed a requirement that an aggregate share of 85 % in voting stock is necessary for executing a replenishment . The threshold was implemented with the aim to compel the United States to participate in replenishment rounds . Though countries intended for the triggers to hold the United States to its commitments , the threshold ultimately provided the United States a de facto veto power over replenishment and capital increase negotiations due to its ability to bring replenishment negotiations to an impasse by threatening to withhold support .

  "Two researchers , Chris Bennett ( 1996 ) and David Peters ( 2000 ) , have found pterosaurs to be protorosaurs or closely related to them . Peters used a technique called DGS , which involves applying the digital tracing features of photo editing software to images of pterosaur fossils . Bennett only recovered pterosaurs as close relatives of the protorosaurs after removing characteristics of the hind limb from his analysis , in an attempt to test the idea that these characters are the result of convergent evolution between pterosaurs and dinosaurs . However , subsequent analysis by Dave Hone and Michael Benton ( 2007 ) could not reproduce this result . Hone and Benton found pterosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs even without hind limb characters . They also criticized previous studies by David Peters , raising questions about whether conclusions reached without access to the primary evidence , that is , pterosaur fossils , can be held to have the same weight as conclusions based strictly on first @-@ hand interpretation . Hone and Benton concluded that , although more primitive pterosauromorphs are needed to clarify their relationships , pterosaurs are best considered archosaurs , and specifically ornithodirans , given current evidence .

Sterling Nesbitt ( 2011 ) found strong support for a clade composed of Scleromochlus and pterosaurs .",
  "The environment or context through which information is received impacts the threat associated with it . For example , if a man is wearing a hoodie and walking rather fast towards you in the morning , in a rich neighborhood , on a crowded street , while it is raining , threat perception is lower than encountering that same individual after dark , in a poverty stricken neighborhood with no rain on an empty street . Although this could have no threatening intentions at all , the context in which you encounter that person will dictate the level of threat associated with them . Ecological contamination hypothesis states : environment taints perceptions . Those who are in dangerous neighborhood seem more dangerous ( ex : police use more force in poverty stricken neighborhoods that have high crime rates and greater proportions of minorities ) . When the background appeared to be safe , racial bias was present ( armed Blacks were shot quicker and more frequently than armed whites ) , vs. when the background was threatening , racial bias was reduced ( demonstrated by a tendency to increase the rate at which White targets were shot increasing ) . Blacks were still treated hostile in dangerous and non dangerous contexts . Dangerous contexts proved to reduce racial bias in the decision to shoot in that Whites were treated in a similar , hostile fashion to Blacks , not that Blacks were treated with similar regard or restraint as Whites . There is an increasing racial bias from white people , racially ambiguous individuals , and Black faces . Racially ambiguous faces get more racial bias than white faces and less racial bias than black faces , acting as an intermediate , on average . In a white @-@ only context , racially ambiguous individuals are viewed as more prototypically Black , whereas in a Black @-@ only context , racially ambiguous individuals are viewed as less prototypically black .

In more complex animals , specialised receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism . Neurons can be connected together in ganglia . In higher animals , specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) and a peripheral nervous system . The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs . The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle , and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle , certain glands and internal organs , including the stomach .",
  "On the night of 4 / 5 July , Nos. 463 and 467 Squadrons bombed supply depots for V @-@ weapons near Saint @-@ Leu @-@ d 'Esserent . Brill 's Lancaster was attacked by three German night fighters , but he was able to evade them with only a few bullets striking his plane . His \" fine leadership and courage \" during the action earned him a bar to his DFC ; the award was promulgated in The London Gazette on 16 January 1945 . Brill completed his second tour of operations later in July but stayed on to fly more missions , often mentoring less experienced crews . By now he had earned a reputation for being quite \" mad \" , as he would often circle back and check over his handiwork after a bombing run , rather than making his escape from the target area as quickly as possible . During non @-@ operational periods , he made a habit of taking a Lancaster on a so @-@ called test flight to the southern border of Northern Ireland , where he and his crew would change into civilian clothes , cross into Ireland and stock up on food and liquor for a party back at Waddington ; he always made a point of inviting the Air Officer Commanding RAAF Overseas Headquarters , Air Vice Marshal Henry Wrigley , to such events , which Wrigley attended without fail . Brill handed over command of No. 467 Squadron on 12 October 1944 , becoming the first man to survive his time as its leader . He had flown a total of 58 missions in Bomber Command when he returned to Australia in the new year . On 29 January 1945 he married Ilma Kitto , a teacher , at Ganmain 's Methodist Church .

  "At the height of the Vijayanagara Empire ( 1350 – 1565 ) , the Mysore and Coorg region was ruled by motley chieftains , or rajas ( \" little kings \" ) . Each raja had dominion over a small area , and each supplied soldiers and annual tribute for the empire 's needs . Soon after the empire 's fall and the subsequent eastward move of the diminished ruling family , many chieftains , especially in the west , tried to loosen their imperial bonds and expand their realms . Sensing opportunity amidst the new uncertainty , various powers from the north invaded the region intermittently . Among these were the Sultanate of Bijapur to the northwest , the Sultanate of Golconda to the northeast , the fledgling Maratha empire , farther northwest , and the Mughal empire , farther north still . For much of the 17th century the tussles between the little kings and the big powers , and amongst the little kings , resulted in shifting sovereignties , loyalties , and borders . By the turn of the 18th century , the political landscape had become better defined . The northwestern hills were being ruled by the Nayaka rulers of Ikkeri , the southwestern , in the Western Ghats , by the Rajas of Coorg , the southern plains by the Wodeyar rulers of Mysore , all of which were Hindu dynasties ; whereas the eastern and northeastern regions were being ruled by the Muslim Nawabs of Arcot and Sira . Of these , Ikkeri and Coorg were independent , Mysore , although much expanded , was formally a Mughal dependency , and Arcot and Sira , Mughal subahs ( or provinces ) .",

  "Molecules are moved within plants by transport processes that operate at a variety of spatial scales . Subcellular transport of ions , electrons and molecules such as water and enzymes occurs across cell membranes . Minerals and water are transported from roots to other parts of the plant in the transpiration stream . Diffusion , osmosis , and active transport and mass flow are all different ways transport can occur . Examples of elements that plants need to transport are nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium , and sulphur . In vascular plants , these elements are extracted from the soil as soluble ions by the roots and transported throughout the plant in the xylem . Most of the elements required for plant nutrition come from the chemical breakdown of soil minerals . Sucrose produced by photosynthesis is transported from the leaves to other parts of the plant in the phloem and plant hormones are transported by a variety of processes .",

  "Each starfish arm contains two gonads that release gametes through openings called gonoducts , located on the central disc between the arms . Fertilization is generally external but in a few species , internal fertilization takes place . In most species , the buoyant eggs and sperm are simply released into the water ( free spawning ) and the resulting embryos and larvae live as part of the plankton . In others , the eggs may be stuck to the undersides of rocks . In certain species of starfish , the females brood their eggs – either by simply enveloping them or by holding them in specialised structures . Brooding may be done in pockets on the starfish 's aboral surface , inside the pyloric stomach ( Leptasterias tenera ) or even in the interior of the gonads themselves . Those starfish that brood their eggs by \" sitting \" on them usually assume a humped posture with their discs raised off the substrate . Pteraster militaris broods a few of its young and disperses the remaining eggs , that are too numerous to fit into its pouch . In these brooding species , the eggs are relatively large , and supplied with yolk , and they generally develop directly into miniature starfish without an intervening larval stage . The developing young are called lecithotrophic because they obtain their nutrition from the yolk as opposed to \" planktotrophic \" larvae that feed in the water column . In Parvulastra parvivipara , an intragonadal brooder , the young starfish obtain nutrients by eating other eggs and embryos in the brood pouch . Brooding is especially common in polar and deep @-@ sea species that live in environments unfavourable for larval development and in smaller species that produce just a few eggs .",

If the input and output connections of a module are with motor areas ( as many are ) , then the module will be involved in motor behavior ; but , if the connections are with areas involved in non @-@ motor cognition , the module will show other types of behavioral correlates . Thus the cerebellum has been implicated in the regulation of many differing functional traits such as affection , emotion and behavior .

  "Although many South Pasadena residents opposed the division of the city that the parkway would bring , the city 's voters elected supporters in the 1936 elections . The state , which had the power to put the road where it wished even had South Pasadena continued to oppose it , approved the route on April 4 , 1936 . The route used the Arroyo Seco 's west bank to near Hough Street , where it crossed to the east and cut through South Pasadena to the south end of Broadway ( now Arroyo Parkway ) in Pasadena . Another project , the Arroyo Seco Flood Control Channel , was built by the Works Progress Administration before and during construction of the parkway to avoid damages from future floods . A number of state engineers toured East Coast roads in early 1938 , including Chicago 's Lake Shore Drive , full and modified cloverleaf interchanges in Massachusetts and New Jersey , and Robert Moses 's parkway system in New York City . The parkway was the first road built in California under a 1939 freeway law that allowed access to be completely limited to a number of specified points . Although , in some areas , it was possible to use a standard diamond interchange , other locations required folded diamonds , or , as the engineers called them , \" compressed cloverleafs \" , where local streets often took the place of dedicated ramps , ending at the parkway with a sharp right turn required to enter or exit . The highway was designed with two 11 – 12 foot ( 3 @.@ 4 @-@ 3 @.@ 7 m ) lanes and one ten @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) shoulder in each direction , with the wider inside ( passing ) lanes paved in black asphalt concrete and the outside lanes paved in gray Portland cement concrete .

So that disabled vehicles could be safely removed from the roadway , about 50 \" safety bays \" were constructed in 1949 and 1950 . ) The engineers used a design speed of 45 miles per hour ( 72 kilometres per hour ) , superelevating curves where necessary to accomplish this .

Above 50 @,@ 000 feet ( 15 @,@ 000 m ) , a sudden cabin depressurisation would leave a \" time of useful consciousness \" up to 10 – 15 seconds for a conditioned athlete . At Concorde 's altitude , the air density is very low ; a breach of cabin integrity would result in a loss of pressure severe enough so that the plastic emergency oxygen masks installed on other passenger jets would not be effective and passengers would soon suffer from hypoxia despite quickly donning them . Concorde was equipped with smaller windows to reduce the rate of loss in the event of a breach , a reserve air supply system to augment cabin air pressure , and a rapid descent procedure to bring the aircraft to a safe altitude . The FAA enforces minimum emergency descent rates for aircraft and noting Concorde 's higher operating altitude , concluded that the best response to pressure loss would be a rapid descent . Continuous positive airway pressure would have delivered pressurised oxygen directly to the pilots through masks .",

Lem went as far as to say that Tarkovsky made Crime and Punishment rather than Solaris , omitting epistemological and cognitive aspects of his book . Tarkovsky claimed that Lem did not fully appreciate cinema and that he expected the film to merely illustrate the novel without creating an original cinematic piece . Tarkovsky 's film is about the inner lives of its scientists as human beings . Lem 's novel is about the conflicts of man 's condition in nature and the nature of man in the universe .

He sponsored an amendment to the Lever Food and Fuel Act forbidding the use of grain – rendered scarce by World War I and a poor harvest in 1916 – to make alcoholic beverages . The amendment passed the House , but a conference committee amended it to allow production of beer and wine . Both measures increased Barkley 's national visibility and set the stage for future prohibition legislation , including the Eighteenth Amendment . By 1917 , the state Democratic Party was divided over prohibition , and the prohibitionist faction tried to enlist Barkley for the 1919 gubernatorial race .

  "Several astronomers tested Kepler 's theory , and its various modifications , against astronomical observations . Two transits of Venus and Mercury across the face of the sun provided sensitive tests of the theory , under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed .

Pierre Gassendi observed the transit on the date predicted , a confirmation of Kepler 's prediction . This was the first observation of a transit of Mercury . However , his attempt to observe the transit of Venus just one month later was unsuccessful due to inaccuracies in the Rudolphine Tables .

  "Many endemic Mascarene birds , including the dodo , are descended from South Asian ancestors , and the English palaeontologist Julian Hume has proposed that this may also be the case for all parrots there . Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene , so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands . Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known , subfossil remains show that they shared common features such as enlarged heads and jaws , reduced pectoral bones , and robust leg bones . Hume has suggested that they all have a common origin in the radiation of the Psittaculini tribe , members of which are known as Psittaculines , basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that Psittacula parrots have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean . The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times , as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea . Other members of the Psittacula genus from the Mascarenes include the extant echo parakeet ( Psittacula eques echo ) of Mauritius , as well as the extinct Réunion parakeet ( Psittacula eques eques ) , and Mascarene grey parakeet ( Psittacula bensoni ) of both Mauritius and Réunion .",

  "Democratisation still left open one important distinction between the former princely states and the former British provinces , namely , that since the princely states had signed limited Instruments of Accession covering only three subjects , they were insulated from government policies in other areas .

Hale , along with John Herne , argued that none of Laud 's alleged offences constituted treason , and that the Treason Act 1351 had abolished all common law treasons .

The park is underlain by neoproterozoic sedimentary rocks of the Burra Group overlying a Precambrian crystalline basement .

This pushed up a mountain range , on the site of the present Mount Lofty Ranges , approximately 450 mya . The range was eroded to a level plain over the following 350 million years . Approximately 40 mya , the location of today 's ranges and plains were flat , with a hard sedimentary capping .

  "Diệm later implicated two Americans , George Carver and Russ Miller for involvement in the plot . Both had spent the coup attempt with the rebel officers . Durbrow had sent them there to keep track of the situation , but Diệm felt that they were there to encourage the uprising ; the coup group 's desired changes were very similar to those advocated by Durbrow in previous months . It was later revealed that Carver had friendly relations with the coup leaders and then arranged for Thuy to be evacuated from South Vietnam when the loyalists overwhelmed the paratroopers . Carver had also spent some of the coup period in a meeting with civilian rebel leaders at Thuy 's house , although it is not known if he pro @-@ actively encouraged Diệm opponents . The Ngô brothers indicated to the Americans that Carver should be deported , and soon after , Carver received a death warrant . The threat was supposedly signed by the coup leaders , who were ostensibly angry because Carver had abandoned them and withdrawn American support for them . The Americans thought that Nhu was the real culprit , but told the Ngô family that they were removing Carver from the country for his own safety , thereby allowing all parties to avoid embarrassment . Years later , Carver said he agreed with the rebels ' thinking that Diệm was doing poorly and needed to be replaced , saying he was \" absolutely convinced \" that a regime change was needed to \" achieve American objective in Vietnam \" . In his memoir , Don claimed Miller had cryptically encouraged him to overthrow Diệm a few months before the coup attempt .",

Scharnhorst and Gneisenau were regarded as well @-@ trained vessels ; both ships won awards for their excellence at gunnery . At the start of World War I , the two ships were in the Caroline Islands on a routine cruise ; the rest of von Spee 's squadron was dispersed around the Pacific . The declaration of war by Japan on Germany convinced von Spee to consolidate his force with the cruisers Leipzig and Dresden from the American station , and head for Chile to refuel . The flotilla would then attempt to return to Germany via the Atlantic Ocean . Admiral von Spee also intended to attack the three British cruisers under the command of Admiral Christopher Cradock , and any British shipping encountered . On 22 September , Scharnhorst and Gneisenau approached the island of Papeete in French Polynesia with the intention of seizing the coal stockpiled in the harbor . The ships conducted a short bombardment that resulted in the sinking of the old gunboat Zélée . However , von Spee feared that the harbor had been mined , and decided to avoid the risk .

  "On September 12 , George Mason of Virginia suggested the addition of a Bill of Rights to the Constitution modeled on previous state declarations , and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts made it a formal motion . However , the motion was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations after only a brief discussion . Madison , then an opponent of a Bill of Rights , later explained the vote by calling the state bills of rights \" parchment barriers \" that offered only an illusion of protection against tyranny . Another delegate , James Wilson of Pennsylvania , later argued that the act of enumerating the rights of the people would have been dangerous , because it would imply that rights not explicitly mentioned did not exist ; Hamilton echoed this point in Federalist No. 84 . Because Mason and Gerry had emerged as opponents of the proposed new Constitution , their motion — introduced five days before the end of the convention — may also have been seen by other delegates as a delaying tactic . The quick rejection of this motion , however , later endangered the entire ratification process . Author David O. Stewart calls the omission of a Bill of Rights in the original Constitution as \" a political blunder of the first magnitude \" while historian Jack N. Rakove calls it \" the one serious miscalculation the framers made as they looked ahead to the struggle over ratification \" .",

  "For around two centuries after the conquest of Wales , the arrangements established by Edward I for the governance of the country remained in place . During this time the castle was constantly garrisoned , and Caernarfon was effectively the capital of north Wales . There was a degree of discrimination , with the most important administrative jobs in Wales usually closed to Welsh people . Tension between the Welsh and their English conquerors spilled over at the start of the 15th century with the outbreak of the Glyndŵr Rising ( 1400 – 1415 ) . During the revolt , Caernarfon was one of the targets of Owain Glyndŵr 's army . The town and castle were besieged in 1401 , and in November that year the Battle of Tuthill took place nearby between Caernarfon 's defenders and the besieging force . In 1403 and 1404 , Caernarfon was besieged by Welsh troops with support from French forces ; the garrison at the time was around thirty . The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne in 1485 heralded a change in the way Wales was administered . The Tudors were Welsh in origin , and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English . As a result , castles such as Caernarfon , which provided secure centres from which the country could be administered , became less important . They were neglected , and in 1538 it was reported that many castles in Wales were \" moche ruynous and ferre in decaye for lakke of tymely reparations \" .",

He succeeded in propagating Polish history , and reminding the world about Poland , while his country remained partitioned and without any independent political representation .

  "Large and formidably toothed , the pigeye shark is regarded as potentially dangerous to humans , though it has not been implicated in any attacks . This species is caught infrequently on longlines and in gillnets , and is used for meat and fins . As a predator , though , the shark can accumulate ciguatera toxins produced by dinoflagellates within its tissues . In November 1993 , some 500 people in Manakara , Madagascar , were poisoned , 98 of them fatally , after eating meat from a pigeye shark . This was the first recorded mass ciguatera outbreak caused by a shark , as well as the first with a significant death toll .

  "In Proposition 45 of his Principia , Newton applies his theorem of revolving orbits to develop a method for finding the force laws that govern the motions of planets . Johannes Kepler had noted that the orbits of most planets and the Moon seemed to be ellipses , and the long axis of those ellipses can determined accurately from astronomical measurements . The long axis is defined as the line connecting the positions of minimum and maximum distances to the central point , i.e. , the line connecting the two apses . For illustration , the long axis of the planet Mercury is defined as the line through its successive positions of perihelion and aphelion . Over time , the long axis of most orbiting bodies rotates gradually , generally no more than a few degrees per complete revolution , because of gravitational perturbations from other bodies , oblateness in the attracting body , general relativistic effects , and other effects . Newton 's method uses this apsidal precession as a sensitive probe of the type of force being applied to the planets .",

  "The brightness of a star , as seen from Earth , is measured with a standardized , logarithmic scale . This apparent magnitude is a numerical value that decreases in value with increasing brightness of the star . The faintest stars visible to the unaided eye are sixth magnitude , while the brightest , Sirius , is of magnitude − 1 @.@ 46 . To standardize the magnitude scale , astronomers chose Vega to represent magnitude zero at all wavelengths . Thus , for many years , Vega was used as a baseline for the calibration of absolute photometric brightness scales . However , this is no longer the case , as the apparent magnitude zero point is now commonly defined in terms of a particular numerically specified flux . This approach is more convenient for astronomers , since Vega is not always available for calibration .",

  "The thesis of eliminativism seems to be so obviously wrong to many critics , under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds , that argumentation seems unnecessary . This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states . Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken . Analogies from the history of science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation : it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth , for example , but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless . Similarly , it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions . Nevertheless , this could equally turn out to be false .",

  "Because written sources of the era are scarce , Gediminas ' ancestry , early life , and assumption of the title of Grand Duke in ca . 1316 are obscure and continue to be the subject of scholarly debate . Various theories have claimed that Gediminas was either his predecessor Grand Duke Vytenis ' son , his brother , his cousin , or his hostler . For several centuries only two versions of his origins circulated . Chronicles — written long after Gediminas ' death by the Teutonic Knights , a long @-@ standing enemy of Lithuania — claimed that Gediminas was a hostler to Vytenis ; according to these chronicles , Gediminas killed his master and assumed the throne . Another version introduced in the Lithuanian Chronicles , which also appeared long after Gediminas ' death , proclaimed that Gediminas was Vytenis ' son . However , the two men were almost the same age , making this relationship unlikely .

  "Biogeographical patterns and range distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species ' traits and niche requirements . Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche . A trait is a measurable property , phenotype , or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival . Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits . Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment . This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range . The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource ; one will always out @-@ compete the other . When similarly adapted species overlap geographically , closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements . Some models and empirical studies , however , suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co @-@ evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species @-@ rich communities . The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope , which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species .",

Most are found on only specific types of animals , and , in some cases , on only a particular part of the body ; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species , although one to three is typical for mammals , and two to six for birds . For example , in humans , different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair . Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host . Some species of chewing lice house symbiotic bacteria in bacteriocytes in their bodies . These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them , it will die . If their host dies , lice can opportunistically use phoresis to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt to find a new host .",

  "The 1866 North German Constitution became ( with some semantic adjustments ) the 1871 Constitution of the German Empire . With this constitution , the new Germany acquired some democratic features : notably the Imperial Diet , which — in contrast to the parliament of Prussia — gave citizens representation on the basis of elections by direct and equal suffrage of all males who had reached the age of 25 . Furthermore , elections were generally free of chicanery , engendering pride in the national parliament . However , legislation required the consent of the Bundesrat , the federal council of deputies from the states , in and over which Prussia had a powerful influence ; Prussia could appoint 17 of 58 delegates with only 14 votes needed for a veto . Prussia thus exercised influence in both bodies , with executive power vested in the Prussian King as Kaiser , who appointed the federal chancellor . The chancellor was accountable solely to , and served entirely at the discretion of , the Emperor . Officially , the chancellor functioned as a one @-@ man cabinet and was responsible for the conduct of all state affairs ; in practice , the State Secretaries ( bureaucratic top officials in charge of such fields as finance , war , foreign affairs , etc . ) acted as unofficial portfolio ministers . With the exception of the years 1872 – 1873 and 1892 – 1894 , the imperial chancellor was always simultaneously the prime minister of the imperial dynasty 's hegemonic home @-@ kingdom , Prussia . The Imperial Diet had the power to pass , amend , or reject bills , but it could not initiate legislation . ( The power of initiating legislation rested with the chancellor . ) The other states retained their own governments , but the military forces of the smaller states came under Prussian control . The militaries of the larger states ( such as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Saxony ) retained some autonomy , but they underwent major reforms to coordinate with Prussian military principles and came under federal government control in wartime .",

  "Abe 's Oddysee was the first major GT title that the UK development team , that had been taken in by GT following the acquisition of Warner Interactive , became involved with . The testing process of the game was unusual for GT Interactive as the British team did game play testing whilst normally American games were only tested in Europe for language and other compatibility issues . The soundtrack features mostly ambient music composed by Ellen Meijers . Because of the lack of testing , the final version of the game left behind a ledge clipping through the floor glitch , a glitch which allows Abe to jump backwards behind screens ( which is also known as a ' Stop Turn ' ) , and an invincibility glitch . All of these glitches can result in skipping of Paramonia and Scrabania , which was first discovered in June 2014 on the Microsoft Windows version of the game .

These other Bangkok residences began to replace the Grand Palace as the primary place of residence of the monarch and his court . By 1925 this gradual move out of the palace was complete .

Despite this the Grand Palace remained the official and ceremonial place of residence as well as the stage set for elaborate ancient ceremonies of the monarchy . The end of the absolute monarchy came in 1932 , when a revolution overthrew the ancient system of government and replaced it with a constitutional monarchy .",

  "When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase , the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate . Depending on the enzyme , the hydride donor is positioned either \" above \" or \" below \" the plane of the planar C4 carbon , as defined in the figure . Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above ; class B enzymes transfer it from below . Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is prochiral , this can be exploited in enzyme kinetics to give information about the enzyme 's mechanism . This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has deuterium atoms substituted for the hydrogens , so the enzyme will reduce NAD + by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen . In this case , an enzyme can produce one of two stereoisomers of NADH .",

  "Aboukir Bay is a coastal indentation 16 nautical miles ( 30 km ) across , stretching from the village of Abu Qir in the west to the town of Rosetta to the east , where one of the mouths of the River Nile empties into the Mediterranean . In 1798 , the bay was protected at its western end by extensive rocky shoals which ran 3 miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) into the bay from a promontory guarded by Aboukir Castle . A small fort situated on an island among the rocks protected the shoals . The fort was garrisoned by French soldiers and armed with at least four cannon and two heavy mortars . Brueys had augmented the fort with his bomb vessels and gunboats , anchored among the rocks to the west of the island in a position to give support to the head of the French line . Further shoals ran unevenly to the south of the island and extended across the bay in a rough semicircle approximately 1 @,@ 650 yards ( 1 @,@ 510 m ) from the shore . These shoals were too shallow to permit the passage of larger warships , and so Brueys ordered his thirteen ships of the line to form up in a line of battle following the northeastern edge of the shoals to the south of the island , a position that allowed the ships to disembark supplies from their port sides while covering the landings with their starboard batteries . Orders were issued for each ship to attach strong cables to the bow and stern of their neighbours , which would effectively turn the line into a long battery forming a theoretically impregnable barrier . Brueys positioned a second , inner line of four frigates approximately 350 yards ( 320 m ) west of the main line , roughly halfway between the line and the shoal . The van of the French line was led by Guerrier , positioned 2 @,@ 400 yards ( 2 @,@ 200 m ) southeast of Aboukir Island and about 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) from the edge of the shoals that surrounded the island . The line stretched southeast , with the centre bowed seawards away from the shoal . The French ships were spaced at intervals of 160 yards ( 150 m ) and the whole line was 2 @,@ 850 yards ( 2 @,@ 610 m ) long , with the flagship Orient at the centre and two large 80 @-@ gun ships anchored on either side .

  "In late 2005 , Murphy starred as Patrick / \" Kitten \" Braden , a transgender Irish foundling in search of her mother , in Neil Jordan 's dramedy Breakfast on Pluto , based on the novel of the same title by Patrick McCabe . Set against the Breakfast on Pluto ’ s kaleidoscopic backdrop of 1970s glitter rock fashion , magic shows , red light districts and I.R.A. violence , Murphy transforms from androgynous teen to high drag blond bombshell . He had auditioned for the role in 2001 , and though Jordan liked him for the part , The Crying Game director was hesitant to revisit transgender and I.R.A. issues . For several years , Murphy lobbied Jordan to make the film before the actor became too old to play the part . In 2004 , Murphy prepared for the role by meeting a transvestite who dressed him and took him clubbing with other transvestites . The role required \" serious primping \" with eyebrow plucking and chest and leg hair removal , and Roger Ebert noted the way that Murphy played the character with a \" bemused and hopeful voice \" . The San Francisco Chronicle 's Ruthe Stein said of his performance , \" Murphy projects enormous energy onscreen , as he 's already shown in 28 Days Later ... and Red Eye . He 's supremely well cast as the androgynous Kitten ... [ and ] smoothly makes the transition from broad comedy to drama . He delivers Kitten 's favourite line , ' Oh serious , serious , serious !

  "Dams interrupt the migration of anadromous fish . Salmon and steelhead return to the streams in which they were born to spawn ; where dams prevent their return , entire populations of salmon die . Some of the Columbia and Snake River dams employ fish ladders , which are effective to varying degrees at allowing these fish to travel upstream . Another problem exists for the juvenile salmon headed downstream to the ocean . Previously , this journey would have taken two to three weeks . With river currents slowed by the dams , and the Columbia converted from wild river to a series of slackwater pools , the journey can take several months , which increases the mortality rate . In some cases , the Army Corps of Engineers transports juvenile fish downstream by truck or river barge . The Chief Joseph Dam and several dams on the Columbia 's tributaries entirely block migration , and there are no migrating fish on the river above these dams . Sturgeon have different migration habits and can survive without ever visiting the ocean . In many upstream areas cut off from the ocean by dams , sturgeon simply live upstream of the dam .",

  "There will be two variations of this future warming feedback : the \" moist greenhouse \" where water vapor dominates the troposphere while water vapor starts to accumulate in the stratosphere ( if the oceans evaporate very quickly ) , and the \" runaway greenhouse \" where water vapor becomes a dominant component of the atmosphere ( if the oceans evaporate too slowly ) that the Earth starts to undergo rapid warming that could send its surface temperature to over 900 ° C ( 1 @,@ 650 ° F ) as the atmosphere will be totally overwhelmed by water vapor , causing its entire surface to melt and killing all life , perhaps in about three billion years . In this ocean @-@ free era , there will continue to be reservoirs at the surface as water is steadily released from the deep crust and mantle , where it is estimated there is an amount of water equivalent to several times that currently present in the Earth 's oceans . Some water may be retained at the poles and there may be occasional rainstorms , but for the most part the planet would be a dry desert with large dunefields covering its equator , and a few salt flats on what was once the ocean floor , similar to the ones in the Atacama Desert in Chile , resembling how Saturn ’ s largest moon Titan looks today .

In April 1965 , construction began on the seven @-@ story 1325 Massachusetts Avenue NW , a Modernist building with broad horizontal swaths of grey brick and glass . ( The structure was home to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association and National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in 2011 . ) Another major office building , 1200 17th Street , NW ( at the time , the headquarters of the American Psychological Association ) , opened in October 1965 . It was a neo @-@ Brutalist structure featuring repetitive polished concrete panels and deeply recessed rectangular windows , and one of the first high @-@ rise office buildings on the downtown business district portion of Connecticut Avenue . That same year his 18 @-@ story Ross Building ( now known as Wytestone Plaza ) in Richmond , Virginia , opened — the first high @-@ rise built in the city since 1928 , and the first glass @-@ curtain wall building constructed in the city . Koubek was also lead architect for and an investor in a syndicate ( \" Reservation Eleven Associates \" ) which designed a new United States Department of Labor ( DOL ) building at 2nd Street NW and Constitution Avenue NW in 1966 . The group proposed an arrangement in which it would construct the building , lease it to the federal government for 30 years , and then donate it to the government . Congress , cutting back on construction funds as well as interested in the build / lease / donate proposal , refused to appropriate funds for the DOL structure . Eventually , however , Koubek 's syndicate lost the commission , and a new DOL building ( jointly designed by the firm of Brooks , Barr , Graeber & White and the firm of Pitts , Mebane , Phelps & White ) was completed in 1974 .",

  "The breeding habits of the grey currawong are not well known , and the inaccessibility of its nests makes study difficult . The breeding season lasts from August to December . The grey currawong builds a large shallow nest of thin sticks lined with grass and bark high in trees ; generally eucalypts are chosen .

  "The military mainly used horses for logistical support during the war ; they were better than mechanized vehicles at traveling through deep mud and over rough terrain . Horses were used for reconnaissance and for carrying messengers , as well as pulling artillery , ambulances , and supply wagons . The presence of horses often increased morale among the soldiers at the front , but the animals contributed to disease and poor sanitation in camps , caused by their manure and carcasses . The value of horses , and the increasing difficulty of replacing them , was such that by 1917 some troops were told that the loss of a horse was of greater tactical concern than the loss of a human soldier .

  "Another name for the faith is the Icelandic Ásatrú , which is more commonly rendered as Asatru in North America ; this term translates as \" allegiance to the Æsir \" – the Æsir being a sub @-@ set of deities in Norse mythology – with practitioners being known as Asatruer . This term is favored by practitioners who focus on the deities of Scandinavia , although is problematic as many self @-@ identified Asatruer worship deities and entities other than the Æsir , such as the Vanir , valkyries , elves , and dwarves . Although initially a popular term of designation among practitioners and academics , usage of Ásatrú has declined as the religion has aged . Other practitioners term their religion Vanatrú , meaning \" those who honor the Vanir \" , or Dísitrú , meaning \" those who honor the goddesses \" , depending on their particular theological emphasis . Although restricted especially to Scandinavia , since the mid @-@ 2000s a term that has grown in popularity is Forn Siðr or Forn Sed ( \" the old way \" ) ; this is also a term reappropriated from Christian usage , having previously been used in a derogatory sense to describe pre @-@ Christian religion in the Old Norse Heimskringla .

  "The average anatomist had difficulty challenging Galen 's or Vesalius 's research ; Galen was the most famous physician of the Greek era and his works were considered the standard of medical understanding up to and throughout the Renaissance ( i.e. for almost two thousand years ) , and various terms being used to describe the clitoris seemed to have further confused the issue of its structure . In addition to Avicenna 's naming it the albaratha or virga ( rod ) and Colombo 's calling it sweetness of Venus , Hippocrates used the term columella ( little pillar ) , and Albucasis , an Arabic medical authority , named it tentigo ( tension ) . The names indicated that each description of the structures was about the body and glans of the clitoris , but usually the glans . It was additionally known to the Romans , who named it ( vulgar slang ) landica . However , Albertus Magnus , one of the most prolific writers of the Middle Ages , felt that it was important to highlight \" homologies between male and female structures and function \" by adding \" a psychology of sexual arousal \" that Aristotle had not used to detail the clitoris . While in Constantine 's treatise Liber de coitu , the clitoris is referred to a few times , Magnus gave an equal amount of attention to male and female organs .",

  "In January 2007 , the city council decided that a branch was to be built during construction at Nørrebro , to allow a future branch line from the City Circle Line towards Brønshøj . The first part of this line was intended to be constructed at the same time as the City Circle Line , to avoid a multitude @-@ higher construction cost and long interruptions of operations later . This did not involve a final decision , only an option for future construction . The Herlev / Brønshøj line was ultimately dropped as the City of Copenhagen withdrew its share of the cost of the Nørrebro branch chamber in its 2009 budget , and the state refused to continue the project . Any branch to the Herlev / Brønshøj region would now require a shutdown of the City Circle Line for an extended period of time ."
