  "In July 2009 , the police installed closed circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras for \" safety and security \" . The police said that the cameras complemented the presence of their officers on the ground and did not record audio inputs . The move drew some negative reactions from the public . Former Nominated Member of Parliament Siew Kum Hong felt that the installation of CCTV cameras was \" pretty ridiculous \" , and wondered if the move might feed the perception in some quarters that Singapore is a police state , since Speakers ' Corner is \" the one place in Singapore \" where people can demonstrate . Nevertheless , the cameras have not affected various events from being held . With effect from 1 December 2009 , the size of Speakers ' Corner was reduced so that it only occupies the half of Hong Lim Park nearer New Bridge Road . From 1 March 2012 , Speakers ' Corner was expanded to include an area behind Kreta Ayer NPP , near the junction of North Canal Road and South Bridge Road .",

Between September 1996 and February 2014 , the team received 100 red cards .

One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha @-@ synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells .

  "The little owl is territorial , the male normally remaining in one territory for life . However the boundaries may expand and contract , being largest in the courtship season in spring . The home range , in which the bird actually hunts for food , varies with the type of habitat and time of year . If a male intrudes into the territory of another , the occupier approaches and emits its territorial calls . If the intruder persists , the occupier flies at him aggressively . If this is unsuccessful , the occupier repeats the attack , this time trying to make contact with his claws . In retreat , an owl often drops to the ground and makes a low @-@ level escape . The territory is more actively defended against a strange male as compared to a known male from a neighbouring territory ; it has been shown that the little owl can recognise familiar birds by voice .",

  "Anderson claimed to be initiated into a tradition of witchcraft in 1926 by a woman \" of the Fairy race \" , whom he elsewhere referred to as \" a priestess from Africa \" . Anderson informed the journalist Margot Adler that when he was nine years old he encountered a small old woman sitting in the centre of a circle containing brass bowls of herbs . He alleged that he instinctively stripped naked and that she then sexually initiated him into a witchcraft tradition , during which he had a vision of a goddess and a horned god . After the vision , he claimed that they sat in the circle and she instructed him in the magical use of the various herbs , after which he was washed in butter , oil , and salt , before putting his clothes on and returning home . The Pagan studies scholar Ethan Doyle White described this as being \" difficult to accept as a literal account \" , but suggested that Anderson may have undergone a significant spiritual experience with an older woman in 1926 , which was subsequently \" embellished into the later tale \" that he told Adler .

  "In East Asia , where polished white rice was the common staple food of the middle class , beriberi resulting from lack of vitamin B1 was endemic . In 1884 , Takaki Kanehiro , a British trained medical doctor of the Imperial Japanese Navy , observed that beriberi was endemic among low @-@ ranking crew who often ate nothing but rice , but not among officers who consumed a Western @-@ style diet . With the support of the Japanese navy , he experimented using crews of two battleships ; one crew was fed only white rice , while the other was fed a diet of meat , fish , barley , rice , and beans . The group that ate only white rice documented 161 crew members with beriberi and 25 deaths , while the latter group had only 14 cases of beriberi and no deaths . This convinced Takaki and the Japanese Navy that diet was the cause of beriberi , but they mistakenly believed that sufficient amounts of protein prevented it . That diseases could result from some dietary deficiencies was further investigated by Christiaan Eijkman , who in 1897 discovered that feeding unpolished rice instead of the polished variety to chickens helped to prevent beriberi in the chickens . The following year , Frederick Hopkins postulated that some foods contained \" accessory factors \" — in addition to proteins , carbohydrates , fats etc . — that are necessary for the functions of the human body .

Baker further notes that Aaronson 's poetry deals with several issues of his time , such as the rise of fascism and the Second World War , but points out that Aaronson did not directly write about the Holocaust . Upon Aaronson 's death , the poet Arthur Chaim Jacobs , compared him with Isaac Rosenberg , the more celebrated poet of the same Anglo @-@ Jewish generation . According to Jacobs , Aaronson was \" clearly influenced by him in terms of diction , and in a kind of verbal energy which runs through a lot of his poetry .

He supported the French Revolution from the outset while serving in the French army , and tried to spread its ideals to his native Corsica . He rose rapidly through the ranks during the Revolution , ending up as commander of the Army of Italy after saving the governing Directory by suppressing a revolt from royalist insurgents . At age 26 , he began his first military campaign against the Austrians and their Italian allies , scoring a series of decisive victories , conquering the Italian Peninsula in a year , and becoming a national hero . In 1798 , he led a military expedition to Egypt that served as a springboard to political power . He engineered a coup in November 1799 and became First Consul of the Republic . His rising ambition and popularity inspired him to go further , and in 1804 he became the first Emperor of the French .

Napoleon shattered this coalition with decisive victories in the Ulm Campaign and a historic triumph at the Battle of Austerlitz , which led to the elimination of the Holy Roman Empire .

  "By March 1944 , No. 77 Wing 's Vengeances had been withdrawn from operations due to their inferiority to newer equipment .

No. 78 Wing 's Kittyhawks shadowed the main task force while heavier aircraft from NWA conducted bombing and mining sorties to indirectly support the operation .

  "The castle builders of Western Europe were aware of and influenced by Roman design ; late Roman coastal forts on the English \" Saxon Shore \" were reused and in Spain the wall around the city of Ávila imitated Roman architecture when it was built in 1091 .

  "Henson was fourteen before his father allowed him either to be baptised or to attend a school . The Rector of Broadstairs conducted the baptism ; there were no godparents , and Henson undertook their functions himself . He took religious instruction from the rector leading to his confirmation as a communicant member of the Church of England in 1878 . At Broadstairs Collegiate School he derived little educational benefit , having already educated himself widely and deeply from books in his father 's library . He rose to be head boy of the school , but after a dispute with the headmaster during which Henson expressed \" with more passion than respect \" his opinion of the head , he ran away from the school in 1879 . He gained employment as an assistant master at Brigg grammar school in Lincolnshire ; the headmaster there recognised his talent and recommended that he should apply for admission to the University of Oxford . Thomas Henson was against the idea , partly because his financial means had declined , but was talked round by his wife and gave his consent . Thomas agreed to fund his son 's studies , but the sum he allowed was too little to pay the substantial fees for residence at any of the colleges of the university . In 1881 Henson applied successfully for admission as an \" unattached \" student , a member of none of the Oxford colleges , but eligible for the full range of university tuition . Cut off from the camaraderie of college life , Henson felt seriously isolated . He concentrated on his studies , and gained a first class honours degree in Modern History in June 1884 .",
  "Some critics interpret Maria 's story ironically , arguing that the juxtaposition of Maria 's sentimental and romantic narrative with Jemima 's harsh and bleak narrative encourages such a reading . In this interpretation , Maria 's narrative is read as a parody of sentimental fiction that aims to demonstrate the \" wrongs \" that women inflict upon themselves when they overindulge in sensibility . Although Wollstonecraft promotes sensibility in this text , it is not the same kind that she condemns in the Rights of Woman ; proper sensibility , she contends , rests on sympathy and , most importantly , is controlled by reason . A woman with this kind of sensibility would not be \" blown about by every gust of momentary feeling \" . Other critics see The Wrongs of Woman as a \" negation \" of the anti @-@ sentimental arguments offered in the Rights of Woman . Citing Jemima 's infrequent appearances in the narrative and the narrator 's own use of the language of sensibility , they have difficulty in accepting the claim that the novel is undercutting or questioning the rhetoric of sensibility .",

  "A magnetostrictive material is one which changes shape when a magnetic field is applied . In reverse , it produces a magnetic field when distorted . The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil of conducting wire around the magnetostrictive material . The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from the motion of the transducer at the filter output . It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range . It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal , but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design .",

  "In 1984 , the statue was closed to the public for the duration of the renovation . Workers erected the world 's largest free @-@ standing scaffold , which obscured the statue from view . Liquid nitrogen was used to remove layers of paint that had been applied to the interior of the copper skin over decades , leaving two layers of coal tar , originally applied to plug leaks and prevent corrosion . Blasting with baking soda powder removed the tar without further damaging the copper . The restorers ' work was hampered by the asbestos @-@ based substance that Bartholdi had used — ineffectively , as inspections showed — to prevent galvanic corrosion . Workers within the statue had to wear protective gear , dubbed \" moon suits \" , with self @-@ contained breathing circuits . Larger holes in the copper skin were repaired , and new copper was added where necessary . The replacement skin was taken from a copper rooftop at Bell Labs , which had a patina that closely resembled the statue 's ; in exchange , the laboratory was provided some of the old copper skin for testing . The torch , found to have been leaking water since the 1916 alterations , was replaced with an exact replica of Bartholdi 's unaltered torch .

Between December 1941 and April 1942 , Dangić engaged in direct negotiations with the Germans . During the latter half of December he met with Abwehr representatives numerous times in an effort to reach an agreement with them . In January 1942 , Dangić and other Chetnik leaders met with Renzo Dalmazzo , the commander of the Italian 6th Army Corps . By this time , Dangić 's cooperation with the Germans came to be seen as being even more valuable because of the arrival of Tito and his First Proletarian Brigade to eastern Bosnia . The Germans and Croats launched Operation Southeast Croatia on 17 January . Dangić and Todorović advised other Chetnik commanders that the operation was targeted at the Partisans , and there was no need for the Chetniks to get involved . Following this , their units withdrew from their positions on the front line , let the Germans pass through their areas , or went home . Many withdrew across the Drina river into the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia to avoid being engaged .

Within a few days , the Germans and Croats succeeded in pushing the Partisans out of eastern Bosnia and southward into the Italian @-@ occupied zone of the NDH .

Writer Benjamin Filene sees this and Dixon 's desire to tell complete stories , with the verses building on each other , as sharing elements of pop music . The chorus , \" But you know I 'm here , everybody knows I 'm here , Well you know I 'm the hoochie coochie man , everybody knows I 'm here \" , confirms the narrator 's identity as both the subject of the gypsy 's prophecy as well as an omnipotent seer himself . Dixon felt that the lyrics expressed part of the audience 's unfulfilled desire to brag , while Waters later admitted that they were supposed to have a comic effect . Music historian Ted Gioia points to the underlying theme of sexuality and virility as sociologically significant . He sees it as challenge to the fear of miscegenation in the dying days of racial segregation in the United States . Record producer Marshall Chess took a simpler view : \" It was sex .

Coonley chose an unusual mascot to represent the ideals of the school . She felt a seahorse was an example of a unique creature who was also a member of a larger community — an analogy for her vision for Avery Coonley . The seahorse swims upright , from which derives the school motto : \" Onward and Upward \" , and representations of seahorses are reflected in decorative ironwork and the weather vane on the 1929 building .",

  "As with many other actinides , self @-@ damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha @-@ particle irradiation is intrinsic to americium . It is especially noticeable at low temperatures , where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low , by broadening of X @-@ ray diffraction peaks . This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium and some of its properties , such as electrical resistivity . So for americium @-@ 241 , the resistivity at 4 @.@ 2 K increases with time from about 2 µOhm · cm to 10 µOhm · cm after 40 hours , and saturates at about 16 µOhm · cm after 140 hours . This effect is less pronounced at room temperature , due to annihilation of radiation defects ; also heating to room temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity . In fresh samples , the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm · cm at liquid helium to 69 µOhm · cm at room temperature ; this behavior is similar to that of neptunium , uranium , thorium and protactinium , but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60 K followed by saturation . The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium , plutonium and curium , but higher than for uranium , thorium and protactinium .",

Convinced the airmen were not spies , but bona @-@ fide airmen , Trautloft reported his findings to command . After reading the report , an outraged Hermann Göring demanded ' at the highest level ' the transfer of the airmen to Luftwaffe control . Unknown to all airmen except Lamason , their execution had been scheduled for 26 October , if they remained at Buchenwald .

Lamason discussed the information at length with Yeo @-@ Thomas , Burney and Robert and they concluded there was little that could be done to avert the mass execution . Lamason decided not to inform the airmen , but to keep this information to himself to keep morale high and in the slight hope the Luftwaffe would intervene in time . Then , on the night of 19 October , seven days before their scheduled execution , 156 of the 168 airmen , including Lamason , were transferred from Buchenwald to Stalag Luft III by the Luftwaffe .",

  "Society throughout Europe was disturbed by the dislocations caused by the Black Death . Lands that had been marginally productive were abandoned , as the survivors were able to acquire more fertile areas . Although serfdom declined in Western Europe it became more common in Eastern Europe , as landlords imposed it on those of their tenants who had previously been free . Most peasants in Western Europe managed to change the work they had previously owed to their landlords into cash rents . The percentage of serfs amongst the peasantry declined from a high of 90 to closer to 50 per cent by the end of the period . Landlords also became more conscious of common interests with other landholders , and they joined together to extort privileges from their governments . Partly at the urging of landlords , governments attempted to legislate a return to the economic conditions that existed before the Black Death .

Alongside Thomas were two other young spatharioi in Bardanes 's retinue , who formed a fraternal association : Leo the Armenian , the future Leo V , and Michael the Amorian , the future Michael II . According to a later hagiographic tradition , before launching his revolt , Bardanes , in the company of his three young protégés , is said to have visited a monk near Philomelion who was reputed to foresee the future . The monk predicted what would indeed happen : that Bardanes 's revolt would fail , that Leo and Michael would both become emperors , and that Thomas would be acclaimed emperor and killed . When Bardanes did in fact rise up , he failed to win any widespread support . Leo and Michael soon abandoned him and defected to the imperial camp and were rewarded with senior military posts . Thomas alone remained loyal to Bardanes until his surrender . In the aftermath of Bardanes 's failure , Thomas disappears from the sources for ten years . Bury suggests that he fled ( for a second time according to his interpretation ) to the Arabs , a view accepted by a number of other scholars , such as Romilly James Heald Jenkins . The historian Warren Treadgold , however , argues that Thomas stayed in the empire and that may have even remained in active military service , and explains his obscurity by Thomas 's association with Bardanes , which hampered his career .",

  "In Greek the gesture was known as the katapygon ( κατάπυγον , from kata – κατά , \" downwards \" and pugē – πυγή , \" rump , buttocks \" ) . In ancient Greek comedy , the finger was a gesture of insult toward another person , with the term katapugon also referring to \" a male who submits to anal penetration \" or katapygaina to a female . In Aristophanes 's comedy The Clouds ( 423 BC ) , when the character Socrates is quizzing his student on poetic meters , Strepsiades declares that he knows quite well what a dactyl is , and gives the finger . The gesture is a visual pun on the two meanings of the Greek word dactylos , both \" finger \" and the rhythmic measure composed of a long syllable and two short , like the joints of a finger ( — ‿ ‿ , which also appears as a visual pun on the penis and testicles in a medieval Latin text ) . Socrates reacts to the gesture as boorish and childish . The gesture recurs as a form of mockery in Peace , alongside farting in someone 's face ; the usage is later explained in the Suda and included in the Adagia of Erasmus . The verb \" to play the Siphnian \" appears in a fragment of Aristophanes and has a similar meaning ; the usage is once again explained in the Suda , where it is said to mean \" to touch the anus with a finger \" . Diogenes Laertius records how the Cynic philosopher Diogenes directed the gesture at the orator Demosthenes in 4th @-@ century BC Athens . In the Discourses of Epictetus , Diogenes 's target is instead one of the sophists .",

After playing through Steins ; Gate on the recommendation of another staff member , Asano decided that Hayashi would be able to create the appealing characters and surprising scenario needed for the story , and asked 5pb. if Hayashi could work on Bravely Default .

  "The Monster was Crane 's first story to feature the fictional town of Whilomville ; it would eventually serve as the setting of 14 stories , 13 of which would appear in the 1900 anthology Whilomville Stories . The town was based on Port Jervis , New York , where the author lived from the age of six to eleven . Although Crane and his mother relocated to Asbury Park , New Jersey , in 1880 , until 1896 he frequently stayed with his older brother and Port Jervis resident William Howe Crane . Crane admitted to his publishers that while he readily used Port Jervis as inspiration while writing The Monster , he was anxious to ensure that the residents of his previous hometown did not recognize themselves in the fictional Whilomville . While Crane biographer Thomas Beer claimed to trace the prototype of Henry Johnson to a Port Jervis teamster named Levi Hume , Crane 's niece , Edna Crane Sidbury , believed the character and his disfigurement were influenced by a local waste collector whose face was damaged by cancer . In Black Frankenstein : The Making of an American Metaphor , author Elizabeth Young theorized that Crane may also have been inspired by popular freak show attractions such as Zip the Pinhead , whose real name was William Henry Johnson , and Joseph Merrick , the Elephant Man . It is also possible that Crane found thematic inspiration in Henrik Ibsen 's An Enemy of the People ; although first published in 1882 , the play — about a physician who finds himself ostracized by his community — first became popular in the United States in the mid @-@ 1890s .",

  "Across the course of the game 's development , the races and graphics of StarCraft have changed drastically from Chris Metzen 's original concept art . In particular , since their initial public debut at E3 1996 , the Zerg have seen extensive changes to their visual design .

  "Having , in his view , perfected many of his ideas and designs for steam engines , Evans turned his attention once more to the commercial propagation of his inventions . His first steam engines had been constructed on an ad @-@ hoc basis , often with improvised tools and workers , and he had relied heavily on blacksmiths and other metal @-@ working shops in Philadelphia with little experience in the more precise metal @-@ work required to build steam engines . In particular , Evans soon realized that unlike his milling machines of wood and leather he would need specialist skills , precision tools and a large foundry in order to build steam machines on a commercial basis . Thus , Evans constructed the Mars Works on a large site a few blocks north of his store in Philadelphia . The choice of name , after the Roman god of war , is thought to have been aspirational and a challenge to the Soho Foundry near Birmingham in the United Kingdom , famous for building the Watt and Boulton engines . Indeed , the completed Mars Works was one of the largest and best equipped outfits of its kind in the United States — by contemporary accounts it featured a substantial foundry , moldmaker 's shop , blacksmith 's shops , millstone maker , a steam engine works and a large steam engine of its own to grind materials and work wrought iron . With over thirty @-@ five staff , the Mars Works produced a wide range of manufactures ranging from working steam engines to cast iron fittings , as well as milling and farming machines for Evans 's now well @-@ established agricultural clientele . Steam engine orders alone proved insufficient to support the extensive business costs ; hence the works became highly experienced in producing all kinds of heavy machinery , contributing to Philadelphia 's emergence as a leading center for such work in the 19th century . Indeed , the works even received military orders , casting naval cannons during the War of 1812 . Evans also proved highly innovative in designing steam power solutions for his clients . In one example where the Mars Works was commissioned to build engines for wool processing factories in Middletown , Connecticut , Evans designed a network of accompanying pipes with radiators to heat the factory with engine exhaust .",

  "I , the Supreme ( orig . Spanish Yo el supremo ) is a historical novel written by exiled Paraguayan author Augusto Roa Bastos .

The central themes of the novel are power and language and the relation between the two . The Supreme believes himself to be above all power and history : \" I don 't write history . I make it . I can remake it as I please , adjusting , stressing , enriching its meaning and truth . \" Yet this assertion is constantly challenged by the very fact that while he achieves power by means of writing and dictating , these very same methods can be used by others to dispute his authority . Not even his own identity , represented by the personal pronoun I , is safe and can easily be usurped as is demonstrated by the incident of the pasquinade . Language , as powerful as it is , can never be controlled and can just as easily be used as an instrument of coercion as an instrument of resistance .",

  "The Libellus is a reply by Pope Gregory I to questions posed by Augustine of Canterbury about certain disciplinary , administrative , and sacral problems he was facing as he tried to establish a bishopric amongst the Kentish people following the initial success of the Gregorian mission in 596 . Modern historians , including Ian Wood and Rob Meens , have seen the Libellus as indicating that Augustine had more contact with native British Christians than is indicated by Bede 's narrative in the Historia Ecclesia . Augustine 's original questions would have been sent to Rome around 598 , but Gregory 's reply was delayed some years due to illness , and was not composed until perhaps the summer of 601 . The Libellus may have been brought back to Augustine by Laurence and Peter , along with letters to the king of Kent and his wife and other items for the mission . However , some scholars have pointed out that the Libellus may in fact never have reached its intended recipient ( Augustine ) in Canterbury . Paul Meyvaert , for example , has noted that no early Anglo @-@ Saxon copy of the Libellus survives that is earlier than Bede 's Historia ecclesiastica ( ca 731 ) , and Bede 's copy appears to derive not from a Canterbury file copy but rather from a Continental canon law collection . This would be strange had the letter arrived in Canterbury in the first place . A document as important to the fledgling mission and to the history of the Canterbury church as the Libellus is likely to have been protected and preserved quite carefully by Canterbury scribes ; yet this seems not to have been the case . Meyvaert therefore suggested that the Libellus may have been waylaid on its journey north in 601 from Rome to England , and only later arrived in England , long after Augustine 's death . This theory is supported well by the surviving manuscript and textual evidence , which strongly suggests that the Libellus circulated widely on the Continent for perhaps nearly a century before finally arriving in England ( see below ) . Still , the exact time , place , and vector by which the Libellus arrived in England and fell into Bede 's hands is still far from certain , and scholars continue to explore these questions .",

The remaining 25 % of the Everglades in its original state is protected in Everglades National Park , but the park was established before the C & SF , and it depended upon the actions of the C & SF to release water . As Miami and other metropolitan areas began to intrude on the Everglades in the 1960s , political battles took place between park management and the C & SF when insufficient water in the park threw ecosystems into chaos .

Emphasizing union with God , it states : \" Meditation engages thought , imagination , emotion , and desire . This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith , prompt the conversion of our heart , and strengthen our will to follow Christ .

  "The determination of stature by anthropologists is based off a series of formulas that have been developed over time by the examination of multiple different skeletons from a multitude of different regions and backgrounds . Stature is given as a range of possible values , in centimeters , and typically computed by measuring the bones of the leg . The three bones that are used are the femur , the tibia , and the fibula . In addition to the leg bones , the bones of the arm , the humerus , ulna , and radius can be used . The formulas that are used to determine stature rely on various information regarding the individual . Sex , ancestry , and age should be determined before attempting to ascertain height , if possible . This is due to the differences that occur between populations , sexes , and age groups . By knowing all the variables associated with height , a more accurate estimate can be made . For example , a male formula for stature estimation using the femur is 2 @.@ 32 × femur length + 65 @.@ 53 ± 3 @.@ 94 cm . A female of the same ancestry would use the formula , 2 @.@ 47 × femur length + 54 @.@ 10 ± 3 @.@ 72 cm . It is also important to note an individual 's approximate age when determining stature . This is due to the shrinkage of the skeleton that naturally occurs as a person ages . After age 30 , a person loses approximately one centimeter of their height every decade .",

She actually spotted the German fleet the night after the battle , but her report was not passed to Jellicoe for fear of giving away the position of the Grand Fleet . Woollcombe was relieved by Captain Algernon Candy on 8 September . The ship was relieved in the squadron by her sister ship Bellona in October 1917 and was on detached duties , probably in preparation for her conversion into a minelayer in December 1917 . Boadicea was assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron in January 1918 and she laid mines at the entrance to the Kattegat on the nights of 18 / 19 and 24 / 25 February 1918 , part of her total of 184 mines laid in three missions . The ship remained with the 4th Battle Squadron for the rest of the war .",

  "To locate a second point on the lines L1 , L2 and L3 , Gergonne noted a reciprocal relationship between those lines and the radical axis R of the solution circles , CA and CB . To understand this reciprocal relationship , consider the two tangent lines to the circle C1 drawn at its tangent points A1 and B1 with the solution circles ; the intersection of these tangent lines is the pole point of L1 in C1 . Since the distances from that pole point to the tangent points A1 and B1 are equal , this pole point must also lie on the radical axis R of the solution circles , by definition ( Figure 9 ) . The relationship between pole points and their polar lines is reciprocal ; if the pole of L1 in C1 lies on R , the pole of R in C1 must conversely lie on L1 . Thus , if we can construct R , we can find its pole P1 in C1 , giving the needed second point on L1 ( Figure 10 ) .",

  "Fernandez , Garfinkel & Arbiol ( 1998 ) use undirected bottleneck shortest paths in order to form composite aerial photographs that combine multiple images of overlapping areas . In the subproblem to which the widest path problem applies , two images have already been transformed into a common coordinate system ; the remaining task is to select a seam , a curve that passes through the region of overlap and divides one of the two images from the other . Pixels on one side of the seam will be copied from one of the images , and pixels on the other side of the seam will be copied from the other image . Unlike other compositing methods that average pixels from both images , this produces a valid photographic image of every part of the region being photographed . They weight the edges of a grid graph by a numeric estimate of how visually apparent a seam across that edge would be , and find a bottleneck shortest path for these weights . Using this path as the seam , rather than a more conventional shortest path , causes their system to find a seam that is difficult to discern at all of its points , rather than allowing it to trade off greater visibility in one part of the image for lesser visibility elsewhere .",

  "Even though Croatia has sufficient water resources at its disposal , these are not uniformly distributed and public water supply network losses remain high — estimated at 44 % . Between 2004 and 2008 , the number of stations monitoring surface water pollution increased by 20 % ; the CEA reported 476 cases of water pollution in this period . At the same time organic waste pollution levels decreased slightly , which is attributed to the completion of new sewage treatment plants ; their number increased 20 % , reaching a total of 101 . Nearly all of Croatia 's groundwater aquifers are top quality , unlike the available surface water ; the latter 's quality varies in terms of biochemical oxygen demand and bacteriological water analysis results . As of 2008 , 80 % of the Croatian population are served by the public water supply system , but only 44 % of the population have access to the public sewerage network , with septic systems in use .

  "Banksia grossa is one of five closely related Banksia species that have highly unusual flower nectar . Whereas other Banksia species produce nectar that is clear and watery , the nectar of these species is pale yellow initially , but gradually becomes darker and thicker , changing to a thick , olive @-@ green mucilage within one to two days of secretion , and eventually becoming \" an almost black , gelatinous lump adhering to the base of the flowers \" . It was first noted by Byron Lamont in 1980 ; he attributed it to cyanobacteria that feed off the nectar sugars . Noting that many of these cyanobacteria had heterocysts , he speculated that they aid the plant by fixing atmospheric nitrogen , which is then washed off the flower heads by rain , and absorbed by the proteoid root mat . This purported symbiosis was investigated by Barrett and Lamont in 1985 , but no evidence of nitrogen fixing was found . Further investigation by Markey and Lamont in 1996 suggested that the discolouration is not caused by cyanobacteria or other microorganisms in the nectar , but is rather \" a chemical phenomenon of plant origin \" . Their analyses indicated that the nectar had unusually high levels of sugar and free amino acids , but three of these species , including B. sphaerocarpa , have since been shown to have normal nectar sugar compositions . The purpose of coloured nectar is unclear , especially as pollinators such as nocturnal mammals are not thought to forage by sight . However , nectar that becomes more obvious by appearance or smell as it ages might encourage pollinators to prioritise it over newer nectar . It is possible the colour change is unrelated to pollination .",

It is difficult to determine whether the Shunzhi Emperor had really named these four Manchu nobles as regents , because they and Empress Dowager Xiaozhuang clearly tampered with the emperor 's testament before promulgating it . The emperor 's will expressed his regret about his Chinese @-@ style ruling ( his reliance on eunuchs and his favoritism toward Chinese officials ) , his neglect of Manchu nobles and traditions , and his headstrong devotion to his consort rather than to his mother . Though the emperor had often issued self @-@ deprecating edicts during his reign , the policies his will rejected had been central to his government since he had assumed personal rule in the early 1650s . The will as it was formulated gave \" the mantle of imperial authority \" to the four regents , and served to support their pro @-@ Manchu policies during the period known as the Oboi regency , which lasted from 1661 to 1669 .",
  "Partial agonists are defined as drugs that , at a given receptor , might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy . Although they are agonists , partial agonists can act as a competitive antagonist in the presence of a full agonist , as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy , thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone . Clinically , their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity . Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant , weak level of activity , whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels . In addition , it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists . Buprenorphine , a partial agonist of the μ @-@ opioid receptor , binds with weak morphine @-@ like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence .",

  "After breaking camp in the morning , the carters set out across the prairie ; transits of the unprotected open prairie between places of refuge were known as traverses .

  "Shortly thereafter , Hugh Arnold @-@ Forster was appointed Secretary of State for War . One of his first acts was to appoint Lord Esher to chair a committee on War Office reform ; this would culminate in the Esher Report of 1904 , which called for a number of administrative reforms , including the formation of the Army Council . In the summer of 1904 , the Norfolk Commission , which had been set up to consider the existing state of the Militia and Volunteers , issued its report . It advocated a form of compulsory service — which was swiftly rejected by the Government — but also offered various more pragmatic reforms which were later taken up as part of the Haldane Reforms . The state of the Militia was reported as \" unfit to take the field \" , and the Volunteer Force was \" not qualified .. against a Regular Army \" . For the time being , however , Arnold @-@ Forster pressed ahead with his reforms , proposing on 14 July 1904 — to strong opposition — that the Regular Army be split into a General Service Army ( liable for peacetime service at home and overseas ) and a Home Service Army ( for peacetime service at home , and able to be sent overseas in time of crisis ) . The Militia was not discussed in the proposals , but he undertook to reduce the strength of the Volunteers and split them into first and second @-@ class units . When the debate resumed in the 1905 session , Parliament having been adjourned shortly after the original announcement , it continued to be attacked , and very little progress was made in implementing it ; an attempt in June 1905 to confidentially identify Volunteer units likely to be disbanded was reported by the Daily Chronicle , and questions were asked in both Houses of Parliament . Arnold @-@ Forster was forced to back down , suggesting that he only wished to determine what proportion of the Volunteers were capable of foreign service .",

Brown Inc analysts figured that selling one million copies of Turok could bring Acclaim as much as $ 45 million . Due to cash flow issues , much of the money planned for marketing Turok was contingent on strong sales of Magic : The Gathering : BattleMage . Endangering Turok 's sales was its high price — $ 79 @.@ 99 in the US , £ 70 in the UK , and $ 129 @.@ 95 in Australia — and Entertainment Software Rating Board 's \" mature \" rating , which suggested lower sales as parents would not buy the game for their children .",

  "Archibald and colleagues suggested that the behavioural habits for Myrmeciites ants , like that of other extinct Myrmeciinae taxa , may have been similar to its extant relatives . Workers would forage onto trees or vegetation to capture arthropod prey or to feed on nectar , soiling either in the ground or in the trees , making them an arboreal nesting insect . Like other Myrmeciine ants , Myrmeciites most likely did not lay pheromone trails or recruit nestmates to food sources ; these ants may have been solitary foragers , relying on their eyes to hunt for prey and for navigational purposes . The nuptial flight of M. ( ? ) tabanifluviensis probably occurred during the late spring or summer , as in extant relatives .",

  "The symptoms of ADHD arise from a deficiency in certain executive functions ( e.g. , attentional control , inhibitory control , and working memory ) . Executive functions are a set of cognitive processes that are required to successfully select and monitor behaviors that facilitate the attainment of one 's chosen goals . The executive function impairments that occur in ADHD individuals result in problems with staying organized , time keeping , excessive procrastination , maintaining concentration , paying attention , ignoring distractions , regulating emotions , and remembering details . People with ADHD appear to have unimpaired long @-@ term memory , and deficits in long @-@ term recall appear to be attributed to impairments in working memory . The criteria for an executive function deficit are met in 30 – 50 % of children and adolescents with ADHD . One study found that 80 % of individuals with ADHD were impaired in at least one executive function task , compared to 50 % for individuals without ADHD . Due to the rates of brain maturation and the increasing demands for executive control as a person gets older , ADHD impairments may not fully manifest themselves until adolescence or even early adulthood .",

The soil was so fertile that a farmer could have three maize harvests a year , or grow cash crops such as sugar or tobacco without hardship ; detailed projections at the Sketch 's end forecast profits of millions of dollars .

  "After the establishment of Scottish independence , Robert I turned his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity .

Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal man @-@ of @-@ war near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde .

After his return to Scotland in 1424 he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith , a house for marine stores , and a workshop . King 's ships , one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429 , were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war , and the office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period .

  "The history of video games spans a period of time between the invention of the first electronic games and today , covering a long period of invention and changes .

Since then , video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern culture in most parts of the world . The early history of video games , therefore , covers the period of time between the first interactive electronic game with an electronic display in 1947 , the first true video games in the early 1950s , and the rise of early arcade video games in the 1970s ( Pong and the beginning of the first generation of video game consoles with the Magnavox Odyssey , both in 1972 ) . During this time there were a wide range of devices and inventions corresponding with large advances in computing technology , and the actual first video game is dependent on the definition of \" video game \" used .",

  "The following year in August 2007 , the battalion made its second Iraq deployment , this time to the Fallujah area where they served under the Regimental Combat Team 6 during the closing phases of Operation Alljah . Their mission was to complete the Clear Hold Build operation in the areas of Karmah and Zaidon which the 2nd Battalion , 5th Marines and 2nd Battalion , 7th Marines had begun two months earlier . Karmah had become an important insurgent stronghold due its proximity both Baghdad and Fallujah . Unlike other cities , Karmah had no definable perimeter to hold , making it easy for outsiders to access . In addition , as insurgents were pushed out of Baghdad by other offensives they found it easy to flee to Karmah . In early September , Kilo Company moved into a cluster of villages northeast of Karmah that was the last major insurgent staging ground in Anbar . The insurgents fled without firing a shot . For the first few months the Marines took small @-@ arms and mortar fire nightly . A 20 @-@ minute attack on 5 October against the Iraqi Police station in Karmah was repulsed by Jim Lanham , now a First Sergeant .

Frogs must be able to move quickly through their environment to catch prey and escape predators , and numerous adaptations help them to do so . Most frogs are either proficient at jumping or are descended from ancestors that were , with much of the musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose . The tibia , fibula , and tarsals have been fused into a single , strong bone , as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs ( which must absorb the impact on landing ) . The metatarsals have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow the frog to push against the ground for a longer period on take @-@ off . The illium has elongated and formed a mobile joint with the sacrum which , in specialist jumpers such as ranids and hylids , functions as an additional limb joint to further power the leaps .

  "Because of their ability to quickly grow and the relative ease with which they can be manipulated , bacteria are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology , genetics and biochemistry . By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes , scientists can determine the function of genes , enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria , then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms .

  "The characters were designed by regular Final Fantasy designer Tetsuya Nomura , art director Yusuke Naora , co @-@ art director Yusaku Nakaaki , and sub @-@ character designer Roberto Ferrari . Naora asked Nomura to contribute to the character designs . Naora and Nomura did the main cast , while Nakaaki and Ferrari handled secondary characters . Each player character was initially given a basic design trait drawn by Nomura . The design was gradually expanded upon during the creative process , working to avoid making them appear similar . Part of this was giving each character a unique weapon : Deuce 's flute and Ace 's cards were the most difficult to realize from a technical standpoint . After the world and setting were created , the characters ' personalities and traits were finalized : for each character , the team planned how each character originated and the events which happened around them .

  "Lundy was granted to the Knights Templar by Henry II in 1160 . The Templars were a major international maritime force at this time , with interests in North Devon , and almost certainly an important port at Bideford or on the River Taw in Barnstaple .

Ownership was disputed by the Marisco family who may have already been on the island during King Stephen 's reign . The Mariscos were fined , and the island was cut off from necessary supplies .

In so doing , he missed three greatly superior passes in the near vicinity , which would be the ones eventually used for railroads and interstate highways . The governor ordered McClellan to turn over his expedition logbooks , but McClellan steadfastly refused , most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout .",

  "Governor Eden was certainly embarrassed by Spotswood 's invasion of North Carolina , while Spotswood disavowed himself of any part of the seizure . He defended his actions , writing to Lord Carteret , a shareholder of the Province of Carolina , that he might benefit from the sale of the seized property and reminding the Earl of the number of Virginians who had died to protect his interests . He argued for the secrecy of the operation by suggesting that Eden \" could contribute nothing to the Success of the Design \" , and told Eden that his authority to capture the pirates came from the king . Eden was heavily criticised for his involvement with Teach and was accused of being his accomplice . By criticising Eden , Spotswood intended to bolster the legitimacy of his invasion . Lee ( 1974 ) concludes that although Spotswood may have thought that the ends justified the means , he had no legal authority to invade North Carolina , to capture the pirates and to seize and auction their goods . Eden doubtless shared the same view . As Spotswood had also accused Tobias Knight of being in league with Teach , on 4 April 1719 , Eden had Knight brought in for questioning . Israel Hands had , weeks earlier , testified that Knight had been on board the Adventure in August 1718 , shortly after Teach had brought a French ship to North Carolina as a prize . Four pirates had testified that with Teach , they had visited Knight 's home to give him presents . This testimony and the letter found on Teach 's body by Maynard appeared compelling , but Knight conducted his defence with competence . Despite being very sick and close to death , he questioned the reliability of Spotswood 's witnesses . He claimed that Israel Hands had talked under duress , and that under North Carolinian law , the other witness , an African , was unable to testify . The sugar , he argued , was stored at his house legally , and Teach had visited him only on business , in his official capacity . The board found Knight innocent of all charges .

  "The Chalukya era may be seen as the beginning in the fusion of cultures of northern and southern India , making way for the transmission of ideas between the two regions .

During this period , the expanding Sanskritic culture mingled with local Dravidian vernaculars which were already popular . Dravidian languages maintain these influences even today . This influence helped to enrich literature in these languages .

  "Most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders . Typically , prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site , the males usually arriving first , calling and setting up territories . Other satellite males remain quietly nearby , waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory . The females arrive sporadically , mate selection takes place and eggs are laid . The females depart and territories may change hands . More females appear and in due course , the breeding season comes to an end . Explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall . These frogs are typically fossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site . They are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place , perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season . The assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues , the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females .",

Thus , Quenya lacks the vowel harmony and consonant gradation present in Finnish , and accent is not always on the first syllable of a word . Typical Finnish elements like the front vowels ö , ä and y are lacking in Quenya , but phonological similarities include the absence of aspirated unvoiced stops or the development of the syllables ti > si in both languages .

  "Fourth Amendment protections expanded significantly with Katz v. United States ( 1967 ) . In Katz , the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual 's right to privacy , and ruled that a search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached to the outside of the glass . While there was no physical intrusion into the booth , the Court reasoned that : 1 ) Katz , by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him , had exhibited his expectation that \" the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world \" ; and 2 ) society believes that his expectation was reasonable . Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that \" the Fourth Amendment protects people , not places \" . A \" search \" occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person 's \" reasonable expectation of privacy . \" Katz 's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government 's intrusion , though electronic rather than physical , was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment , and thus necessitated a warrant . The Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment , and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed .",

Henry imprisoned Margaret 's nephew Edward , Earl of Warwick , the son of her brother George , in the Tower of London , but in 1487 Margaret financed a rebellion led by Lambert Simnel pretending to be Edward . John de la Pole , 1st Earl of Lincoln , joined the revolt , probably anticipating that it would further his own ambitions to the throne , but he was killed in the suppression of the uprising at the Battle of Stoke Field in 1487 . Warwick was implicated by two further failed invasions supported by Margaret using Perkin Warbeck pretending to be Edward IV 's son Richard of Shrewsbury , and Warbeck 's later planned escape for them both ; Warwick was executed in 1499 . Edward 's execution may simply have been a precondition for the marriage of Arthur , Prince of Wales to Katherine of Aragon in 1501 .",

  "Hurricane Kyle began as a weak area of low pressure associated with a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on September 12 . The system tracked in a general westward direction with little convective development and tracked over the Leeward Islands on September 18 . An upper @-@ level trough situated over the eastern Caribbean Sea interacted with the wave , resulting in an increase in shower and thunderstorm activity . The following day , a larger surface circulation developed as the low moved towards the northwest . The wave later became separated from the low , with the wave continuing towards the west and the low tracking to the northwest . The National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) , at this time , were not anticipating significant development of the low as strong wind shear inhibited deep convection from forming .

  "Retiarii first appeared in the arena during the 1st century AD and had become standard attractions by the 2nd or 3rd century . The gladiator 's lack of armour and his reliance on evasive tactics meant that many considered the retiarius the lowliest ( and most effeminate ) of an already stigmatised ( i.e. gladiators ) class . Passages from the works of Juvenal , Seneca , and Suetonius suggest that those retiarii who fought in tunics may have constituted an even more demeaned subtype ( retiarii tunicati ) who were not viewed as legitimate retiarii fighters but as arena clowns . Nevertheless , Roman artwork , graffiti , and grave markers include examples of specific net @-@ men who apparently had reputations as skilled combatants and lovers .",
