  "The speed of Pine Island Glacier increased by 73 percent from 1974 to the end of 2007 , with an 8 percent increase over the last 16 months of this period alone . This speed up has meant that by the end of 2007 the Pine Island Glacier system had a negative mass balance of 46 gigatonnes per year , which is equivalent to 0 @.@ 13 mm ( 0 @.@ 0051 in ) per year global sea level rise . In other words , much more water was being put into the sea by PIG than was being replaced by snowfall . Measurements along the centre of the ice stream by GPS demonstrated that this acceleration is still high nearly 200 km ( 120 mi ) inland , at around 4 percent over 2007 . It has been suggested that this recent acceleration could have been triggered by warm ocean waters at the end of PIG , where it has a floating section ( ice shelf ) approximately 50 km ( 31 mi ) long . It has also been shown that PIG underwent rapid thinning during the Holocene , and that this process may continue for centuries after it is initiated .",
  "By day four , 20 September , the brigade still holding out at the bridge had been split into two groups during the night by the Germans who had managed to infiltrate close enough to separate them into positions east and west of the bridge road . Any movement was subjected to machine @-@ gun and sniper fire and they were under almost constant mortar and artillery attack . Added to this were probes by tanks and self propelled guns , which approached the defenders ' buildings and opened fire at point blank range . The brigade , out of anti @-@ tank ammunition , could do nothing to stop them in the east , but the 6 pounders in the west still proved an effective deterrent . During the day , Lieutenant John Grayburn of the 2nd Battalion was killed and later posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his bravery during the fighting at the bridge . That morning , communications with 1st Airborne Division were established and Frost , on asking for reinforcements and supplies , was informed that the division was surrounded at Oosterbeek and the brigade was on their own . Frost was later wounded and command of the brigade assumed by Major Frederick Gough of the reconnaissance squadron . By midday the brigade position was untenable and the last defenders were withdrawn into what had been the Headquarters Company , 2nd Battalion 's position . By nightfall they were still holding out , and in the darkness some men tried unsuccessfully to break out . At dawn on day five , what was left of the brigade was forced to surrender .",

  "Red Dead Redemption is one of the first games by Rockstar to use an original score . Music supervisor Ivan Pavlovich has cited the large scale of the game as one of the largest difficulties when producing the score . He said that , in order to achieve an effective gaming experience , the game could not solely feature licensed music , like previous Rockstar games . \" We figured we 'd need to write an original score , \" Pavlovich said . To work on the score , Rockstar engaged Bill Elm and Woody Jackson , member and former member of Friends of Dean Martinez , respectively . In collaboration with each other , the duo composed over fourteen hours of music , which scores the game 's missions , across fifteen months . The original score and subsequent album were both recorded and mixed at Jackson 's personal recording studio in Los Angeles , and mastered at Capitol Studios . Following the recording , Irish producer and composer David Holmes listened to the original score , and subsequently spent three weeks compiling fifteen instrumental tracks that could be used as standalone songs for the game 's official soundtrack . Holmes attempted to make the soundtrack representative of the variety of sounds and moods in the game . Four vocal performances were also recorded for use in the soundtrack .",
  "According to mainstream scholarly consensus , the Hungarians are not the autochthonous population of the Carpathian Basin . Their ancestors arrived there through a series of westward migrations across the Eurasian steppes around 894 , centuries after their departure from their original homeland located somewhere in the East . Many details of the Magyars ' prehistory – the location of their original homeland , the ancient Magyars ' connections with the Turkic peoples and the Khazar Khaganate , their lifestyle and political organization , and the background of their conquest of the Carpathian Basin – are still subject to scholarly debates . With regard of the connections between the Magyars and the Turkic tribes , archaeologist Gyula László mooted an alternative theory in the 1960s . According to his theory of the \" double conquest \" , a large group of people who spoke a Finno @-@ Ugrian language arrived in the Carpathian Basin in 670 , and a Turkic @-@ speaking people conquered the same territory in the late 9th century .

  "The significance of Aalborg 's industry began to decline in the 1970s , precipitating a fall in the city 's population until about 1990 when it again began to increase . By the year 2000 , the service and education sectors accounted for about 60 percent of the workforce , partly as a result of the founding of Aalborg University in 1974 .

  "Attitudes of the Russian space program and NASA towards Phase One were also of concern to the astronauts involved . Because of Russia 's financial issues , many workers at the TsUP felt that the mission hardware and continuation of Mir was more important than the lives of the cosmonauts aboard the station . As such the program was run very differently compared to American programs : cosmonauts had their days being planned for them to the minute , actions ( such as docking ) which would be performed manually by shuttle pilots were all carried out automatically , and cosmonauts had their pay docked if they made any errors during their flights . Americans learned aboard Skylab and earlier space missions that this level of control was not productive and had since made mission plans more flexible . The Russians , however , would not budge , and many felt that significant work time was lost because of this .",

In all previous episodes , and the majority of those following it , the episode starts after the opening credits and follows a three @-@ act model , more in the style of a short film than a traditional television episode . \" Pinkeye \" was the first episode in which Kenny 's death was a key element of the episode and a catalyst of the plot , rather than a throwaway gag . It was also the first time Kenny died multiple times : once in the beginning , once as a zombie and once at the end when he is resurrected a second time . The blood featured in the episode was deliberately designed to look primitive as a reference to The Spirit of Christmas , the 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone that served as a precursor to South Park , in which the blood was literally drawn with a Sharpie marker . For the final scene when Kenny comes back to life a second time , the dramatic music was inserted at the last moment by Parker with a synthesizer .",

  "The Puerto Rico Campaign , which began with the Yales 's capture of the Rita on May 8 and ended on August 13 after the Treaty of Paris was signed , was short compared to the other campaigns in the Spanish – American War , because the war came to an end before the military objective of the campaign was completed . Among the factors which benefited the invaders in the short campaign was that the Puerto Ricans who resided in the southern and western towns and villages resented Spanish rule and tended to view the Americans as their liberators . Some Puerto Rican leaders such as José de Diego and Eugenio María de Hostos expected the United States to grant the island its independence and in the case of Rosendo Matienzo Cintrón and the committee which he headed , greeted General Miles and the invaders in Ponce with banquets . Believing that Puerto Rico would gain its independence , a group of men staged an uprising in Ciales which became known as \" El Levantamiento de Ciales \" or the \" Ciales Uprising of 1898 \" and proclaimed Puerto Rico to be a republic .

  "The story is set during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I , a period of religious conflict in England . Not only was there the threat of a Catholic resurgence but there were also disputes within the Protestant Church . When Gonsales first encounters the Lunars he exclaims \" Jesu Maria \" , at which the Lunars fall to their knees , but although they revere the name of Jesus they are unfamiliar with the name Maria , suggesting that they are Protestants rather than Catholics ; Poole is of the same opinion : \" their lack of reaction to the name of Mary suggests that they have not fallen into the errors of the Catholic Church , despite some otherwise rather Catholic @-@ looking institutions on the moon \" . Beginning in the 1580s , when Godwin was a student at Oxford University , many publications criticising the governance of the established Church of England circulated widely , until in 1586 censorship was introduced , resulting in the Martin Marprelate controversy . Martin Marprelate was the name used by the anonymous author or authors of the illegal tracts attacking the Church published between 1588 and 1589 . A number of commentators , including Grant McColley , have suggested that Godwin strongly objected to the imposition of censorship , expressed in Gonsales 's hope that the publication of his account may not prove \" prejudicial to the Catholic faith \" . John Clark has suggested that the Martin Marprelate controversy may have inspired Godwin to give the name Martin to the Lunar 's god , but as a bishop of the Church of England it is perhaps unlikely that he was generally sympathetic to the Martin Marprelate position . Critics do not agree on the precise denomination of Godwin 's Lunars . In contrast with Clark and Poole , David Cressy argues that the Lunars falling to their knees after Gonsales 's exclamation ( a similar ritual takes place at the court of Irdonozur ) is evidence of \" a fairly mechanical form of religion ( as most of Godwin 's Protestant contemporaries judged Roman Catholicism ) \" .",

  "The passenger pigeon was an important source of food for the people of North America . The indigenous peoples ate pigeons , and tribes near nesting colonies would sometimes move to live closer to them and eat the juveniles , killing them at night with long poles . Many Native Americans were careful not to disturb the adult pigeons , and instead ate only the juveniles as they were afraid that the adults might desert their nesting grounds ; in some tribes , disturbing the adult pigeons was considered a crime . Away from the nests , large nets were used to capture adult pigeons , sometimes up to 800 at a time . Low @-@ flying pigeons could be killed by throwing sticks or stones . At one site in Oklahoma , the pigeons leaving their roost every morning flew low enough that the Cherokee could throw clubs into their midst , which caused the lead pigeons to try to turn aside and in the process created a blockade that resulted in a large mass of flying , easily hit pigeons . Among the game birds , passenger pigeons were second only to the wild turkey ( Meleagris gallopavo ) in terms of importance for the Native Americans living in the southeastern United States . The bird 's fat was stored , often in large quantities , and used as butter . Archaeological evidence supports the idea that Native Americans ate the pigeons frequently prior to colonization .",
  "The Court declined to accept Malaysia 's argument that the Singapore Colonial Secretary 's query about the status of Pedra Branca in 1953 indicated that the United Kingdom had no conviction that the island was part of its territory . It felt the letter of inquiry showed the Singapore authorities were not clear about events that had occurred over a century earlier and that they were unsure their records were complete , which was understandable in the circumstances . It also disagreed that the Acting State Secretary of Johor , who had stated in his letter of reply that Johor did not claim ownership of the island , had acted without authority . The Johor Agreement was irrelevant – as the Colonial Secretary was a representative of the United Kingdom government which was not a foreign state in relation to Johor at the time , there was no question of the United Kingdom having to consent to Johor issuing the reply . The Federation of Malaya Agreement also did not assist Malaysia because the action of responding to a request for information was not an \" exercise \" of \" executive authority \" . Further , since Malaysia had not invoked this argument in its negotiations with Singapore and in the ICJ proceedings until late in the oral phase , Singapore was entitled to presume that the Acting State Secretary had acted within his authority . The meaning of the reply was clear – as of 1953 , Johor understood it did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca , and thus the Singapore authorities had no reason to doubt that the island belonged to the United Kingdom .",

For the scene in which the Expendables crash their Canadair CL @-@ 215 amphibious plane into a cave , the effects team intended to use Miniature effects , filming using a 1 / 3 scale model of the 90 @-@ feet wing span plane . Production constraints and the limited shooting schedule meant the miniature shoot was abandoned and the entire sequence was rendered digitally . The plane itself was also digitally modified , adding a nose mounted gun which in practice could have stalled the engine with its recoil . A rear hatch door was required for jet skis to drive into the plane but the crafts design made such a door impractical ; visual trickery was used to obscure this fact and make the door fit into the existing plane design . A helicopter used in the opening sequence was required to perform more dynamic moves and so it was digitally removed entirely and replaced with a digital recreation that better fit the scene 's requirements . The helicopter which decapitates Hector during his fight with Christmas had no rotors and they were digitally added . WWFX later enhanced it more , modifying lighting and stabilizing the helicopter 's body which shook unnaturally when struck during the fight . The Sangs Mi @-@ 8 helicopter was a civilian variant , but it was digitally replaced with the gunship variant , the Hip @-@ E , to make it look meaner and more fitting for Van Damme 's villainous mercenary , with a black reflective coating and armaments .

  "Sayf al @-@ Dawla entered the fray against the Byzantines in 936 , when he led an expedition to the aid of Samosata , at the time besieged by the Byzantines . A revolt in his rear forced him to abandon the campaign , and he only managed to send a few supplies to the town , which fell soon after . In 938 , he raided the region around Malatya and captured the Byzantine fort of Charpete . Some Arab sources report a major victory over Kourkouas himself , but the Byzantine advance does not seem to have been affected . His most important campaign in these early years was in 939 – 940 , when he invaded southwestern Armenia and secured a pledge of allegiance and the surrender of a few fortresses from the local princes — the Muslim Kaysites of Manzikert and the Christian Bagratids of Taron and Gagik Artsruni of Vaspurakan — who had begun defecting to Byzantium , before turning west and raiding Byzantine territory up to Koloneia . This expedition temporarily broke the Byzantine leaguer around Qaliqala , but Sayf al @-@ Dawla 's preoccupation with his brother 's wars in Iraq over the next years meant that it was not followed up . This was a major missed chance ; as the historian Mark Whittow comments , a more sustained policy could have made use of the Armenian princes ' distrust of Byzantine expansionism , to form a network of clients and contain the Byzantines . Instead , the latter were given a free hand , which allowed them to press on and capture Qaliqala , cementing their dominance over the region .",

  "Fi was created before the implantation of Wii MotionPlus , when she was going to be part of some different undefined gameplay concepts unrelated to motion control . Her design was based on the design of the Master Sword , referencing her origins as the sword 's spirit . She also served as an alternative explanatory voice as Link was a silent protagonist . According to staff , Fi 's technical dialogue for each area of the game was written by different people , verbal inconsistencies arose that needed addressing , so Fujibayashi adjusted them all so she sounded consistent . Nearly all of Fi 's dialogue was ultimately written by Fujibayashi . Ghirahim was designed to be similar to the Dark Link character from Ocarina of Time : he could read Link 's movements , requiring players to think strategically to defeat him rather than simply swinging Link 's sword around randomly . Character designs were far more detailed than in previous Zelda titles . Clothing was frequently designed to complement backgrounds , such as Zelda 's pink and red dress in the opening . The game 's use of warm colors and brushstroke @-@ like aesthetics was inspired by impressionist artwork , pioneered in the 19th century by painters such as Claude Monet : a particular element cited by Miyamoto was the sky , which he called a tribute to the work of Paul Cézanne . The basic starting point for the art style was the fact of it being a fantasy world . The final version was referred to as a balance between the more overt cartoon styling of The Legend of Zelda : The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess , where the cartoon shading was transferred onto an older version of Link . The team settled this artstyle as it would properly portray the more exaggerated actions of some characters and general swordplay while preserving Link 's mature appearance .",

  "The Pure Food and Drug Act was then passed by the United States Congress in 1906 and required that certain special drugs , including cannabis , be accurately labeled with contents . Previously , many drugs had been sold as patent medicines with secret ingredients or misleading labels . Even after the passage of regulations , there continued to be criticisms about the availability of narcotics and around 1910 there was a wave of legislation aimed to strengthen requirements for their sale and remove what were commonly referred to as \" loopholes \" in poison laws . The new revisions aimed to restrict all narcotics , including cannabis , as poisons , limit their sale to pharmacies , and require doctor 's prescriptions . The first instance was in the District of Columbia in 1906 , under ' An act to regulate the practice of pharmacy and the sale of poisons in the District of Columbia , and for other purposes ' .

  "Where Rimsky @-@ Korsakov changed between these two sets of works was in orchestration . While his pieces were always celebrated for their imaginative use of instrumental forces , the sparser textures of Sadko and Antar pale compared to the luxuriance of the more popular works of the 1880s . While a principle of highlighting \" primary hues \" of instrumental color remained in place , it was augmented in the later works by a sophisticated cachet of orchestral effects , some gleaned from other composers including Wagner , but many invented by himself . As a result , these works resemble brightly colored mosaics , striking in their own right and often scored with a juxtaposition of pure orchestral groups . The final tutti of Scheherazade is a prime example of this scoring . The theme is assigned to trombones playing in unison , and is accompanied by a combination of string patterns . Meanwhile , another pattern alternates with chromatic scales in the woodwinds and a third pattern of rhythms is played by percussion .",

The book Norsk bondereisning , published in 1926 as a compilation of Koht 's presented material in his university lectures , represented the culmination of Koht 's work on the topic of class conflict between the agrarian and the urban population .

There is little documentary evidence for his early years ; historians Warren Hollister and Kathleen Thompson suggest he was brought up predominantly in England , while Judith Green argues he was initially brought up in the Duchy . He was probably educated by the Church , possibly by Bishop Osmund , the King 's chancellor , at Salisbury Cathedral ; it is uncertain if this indicated an intent by his parents for Henry to become a member of the clergy . It is also uncertain how far Henry 's education extended , but he was probably able to read Latin and had some background in the liberal arts . He was given military training by an instructor called Robert Achard , and Henry was knighted by his father on 24 May 1086 .",

The Finnish language had been a major source of inspiration , but Tolkien was also familiar with Latin , Greek , and ancient Germanic languages when he began constructing Quenya . Another notable feature of Tolkien 's Elvish languages was his development of a complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe .

  "In critiquing the rise of Internet @-@ based computing , the philosophical question of whether or not a society can control technological progress was raised . At the online scientific magazine Edge , Wikipedia co @-@ founder Larry Sanger argued that individual will was all that was necessary to maintain the cognitive capacity to read a book all the way through , and computer scientist and writer Jaron Lanier rebuked the idea that technological progress is an \" autonomous process that will proceed in its chosen direction independently of us \" . Lanier echoed a view stated by American historian Lewis Mumford in his 1970 book The Pentagon of Power , in which Mumford suggested that the technological advances that shape a society could be controlled if the full might of a society 's free will were employed . Lanier believed that technology was significantly hindered by the idea that \" there is only one axis of choice \" which is either pro- or anti- when it comes to technology adoption . Yet Carr had stated in The Big Switch that he believed an individual 's personal choice toward a technology had little effect on technological progress . According to Carr , the view expressed by Mumford about technological progress was incorrect because it regarded technology solely as advances in science and engineering rather than as an influence on the costs of production and consumption . Economics were a more significant consideration in Carr 's opinion because in a competitive marketplace the most efficient methods of providing an important resource will prevail . As technological advances shape society , an individual might be able to resist the effects but his lifestyle will \" always be lonely and in the end futile \" ; despite a few holdouts , technology will nevertheless shape economics which , in turn , will shape society .",

  "There are four fundamental steps in the fusion process . First , the involved membranes must aggregate , approaching each other to within several nanometers . Second , the two bilayers must come into very close contact ( within a few angstroms ) . To achieve this close contact , the two surfaces must become at least partially dehydrated , as the bound surface water normally present causes bilayers to strongly repel . The presence of ions , in particular divalent cations like magnesium and calcium , strongly affects this step . One of the critical roles of calcium in the body is regulating membrane fusion . Third , a destabilization must form at one point between the two bilayers , locally distorting their structures . The exact nature of this distortion is not known . One theory is that a highly curved \" stalk \" must form between the two bilayers . Proponents of this theory believe that it explains why phosphatidylethanolamine , a highly curved lipid , promotes fusion . Finally , in the last step of fusion , this point defect grows and the components of the two bilayers mix and diffuse away from the site of contact .",

  "Employment in public transport aviation was difficult to find in 1931 , but Koch was able to continue flying with the Citizen Air Force at No. 1 Squadron , Laverton . He flew as second pilot without pay for Australian National Airways in 1931 , to gain experience , and was lucky not to be aboard the ill @-@ fated Southern Cloud , when family commitments prevented him taking his position . In mid @-@ 1933 he was appointed instructor with the Australian Aero Club , based at Essendon Aerodrome . In November 1933 , he was recruited by Guinea Airways as an aircraft captain , and was to spend the next five years in Papua and New Guinea . He flew the Junkers W 34 , the Junkers G 31 , and the Ford Tri @-@ Motor during this time , gaining much experience with sea operations when the W34 was float equipped . He gained some fame from his efforts to deliver supplies to the second ( 1936 – 37 ) Archbold Expedition . The expedition had become isolated when its own aircraft was accidentally destroyed in Port Moresby harbour , and was thought to be camped in the Blucher Mountains near the headwaters of the Strickland River , low on supplies and without fuel for its generators . Koch , operating out of Mt Hagen in a Ford fitted with long range tanks , found the party and resupplied it by parachute with food and gasoline . Among his many photographs taken during this period are several of the last known days of Amelia Earhart at Lae aerodrome . He married Clarice Grant on 1 June 1933 , in Melbourne ; the couple were to have a daughter and two sons .",
  "In 1978 , when Vietnamese leaders launched their invasion of Kampuchea to remove the Khmer Rouge regime , they did not expect a negative reaction from the international community . However , the events that followed the invasion showed that Vietnamese leaders had severely miscalculated international sympathies towards their cause . Instead of backing Vietnam , most United Nations member countries denounced the Vietnamese use of force against Kampuchea , and even moved to revive the battered Khmer Rouge organisation that had once governed the country with such brutality . Thus , more than just a military problem , Kampuchea quickly evolved into an economic and diplomatic problem for Vietnam on the international arena . Throughout the decade in which Vietnam occupied neighbouring Kampuchea , the Vietnamese Government , and the PRK regime which it installed , were placed on the periphery of the international community .",

  "The abilities of the Emperor and the newly appointed conservative cabinet were tested by three crises between 1848 and 1852 . The first crisis was a confrontation over the illegal importation of slaves . Importing slaves had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with Britain . Trafficking continued unabated , however , and the British government 's passage of the Aberdeen Act of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian ships and seize anyone who was found to be involved in the slave trade . While Brazil grappled with this problem , the Praieira revolt , a conflict between local political factions within Pernambuco province ( and one in which liberal and courtier supporters were involved ) , erupted on 6 November 1848 , but was suppressed by March 1849 . It was the last rebellion to occur during the monarchy , and its end marked the beginning of forty years of internal peace in Brazil . The Eusébio de Queirós Law was promulgated on 4 September 1850 giving the government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade . With this new tool Brazil moved to eliminate the importation of slaves , and by 1852 this first crisis was over , with Britain accepting that the trade had been suppressed .",

  "The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus and upper soil of pine forests . This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees , and can cover an area of several square meters . These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses ; reindeer lichens often occur in the center of large mats . The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil , resulting in a thinner humus layer , decreased groundwater penetration , decreased soil pH , and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots . The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations . Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil . Similar to some other Hydnellum species , H. ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear @-@ cutting , a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe . The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at the leading edge of the mycelial mat , but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge , showing saprophytic tendencies .",

  "Scotland appeared to be fertile ground for Methodism in the 1740s and 1750s , when visits from figures such as John Wesley and George Whitfield attracted large audiences of presbyterians . Methodist societies were established in textile and fishing villages , particularly in Shetland , where Methodism was to enjoy its greatest relative popularity . Most members were to be in the large cities , with Glasgow and Airdrie accounting for 43 per cent of all members in 1819 . However , in the 1760s the growth of the movement did not keep pace with that elsewhere in the United Kingdom , with an average annual increase of only 0 @.@ 2 per cent , compared with 5 , nearly 6 and nearly 8 per cent in England , Wales and Ireland respectively . The reasons for the relative failure of Methodism in Scotland have been debated by historians . The Scots preferred an ordained clergy , rather than the lay preachers common elsewhere , and when Wesley granted this concession in 1785 membership doubled in four years , but it was rescinded after this death in 1791 and adherence reduced . The middle classes may also have seen the lay positions in the church as not carrying the same status as did offices like that of elder within the presbyterian churches . Allan MacLaren has argued that the doctrinal Arminianism of Methodism conflicted with the dominant Calvinism of Scotland . The place that Methodism occupied elsewhere in the kingdom may also have been taken by the Secession and Relief churches , the last of which were seen as \" Scots Methodists \" .",

  "The Mikea are not remnants of an early hunter @-@ gatherer society .

Colonial French documents dating to 1901 describe hunter gatherers by the name of Mikea living in the southwest of the island . The population is believed to have swelled during the 1947 uprising against French colonial rule , when many Malagasy families left towns and villages to hide in forests across the country .

  "The castle 's structure shows the results of its redesign at the start of the 14th century , using two very different forms of architecture .

  "Techniques that rely on homologous recombination have been used to engineer new proteins . In a study published in 2007 , researchers were able to create chimeras of two enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids , a diverse class of compounds including hormones , visual pigments and certain pheromones . The chimeric proteins acquired an ability to catalyze an essential reaction in isoprenoid biosynthesis — one of the most diverse pathways of biosynthesis found in nature — that was absent in the parent proteins . Protein engineering through recombination has also produced chimeric enzymes with new function in members of a group of proteins known as the cytochrome P450 family , which in humans is involved in detoxifying foreign compounds like drugs , food additives and preservatives .",

  "Apollonius ' problem can be extended from the plane to the sphere and other quadratic surfaces . For the sphere , the problem is to construct all the circles ( the boundaries of spherical caps ) that are tangent to three given circles on the sphere . This spherical problem can be rendered into a corresponding planar problem using stereographic projection . Once the solutions to the planar problem have been constructed , the corresponding solutions to the spherical problem can be determined by inverting the stereographic projection . Even more generally , one can consider the problem of four tangent curves that result from the intersections of an arbitrary quadratic surface and four planes , a problem first considered by Charles Dupin .",

  "Joint attention is an important mechanism through which children learn to map words @-@ to @-@ world , and vice versa . Adults commonly make an attempt to establish joint attention with a child before they convey something to the child . Joint attention is often accompanied by physical co @-@ presence , since children are often focused on what is in their immediate environment . As well , conversational co @-@ presence is likely to occur ; the caregiver and child typically talk together about whatever is taking place at their locus of joint attention . Social pragmatic perspectives often present children as covariation detectors , who simply associate the words that they hear with whatever they are attending to in the world at the same time . The co @-@ variation detection model of joint attention seems problematic when we consider that many caregiver utterances do not refer to things that occupy the immediate attentional focus of infants . For instance , caregivers among the Kaluli , a group of indigenous peoples living in New Guinea , rarely provide labels in the context of their referents . While the covariation detection model emphasizes the caregiver 's role in the meaning @-@ making process , some theorists argue that infants also play an important role in their own word learning , actively avoiding mapping errors . When infants are in situations where their own attentional focus differs from that of a speaker , they seek out information about the speaker 's focus , and then use that information to establish correct word @-@ referent mappings . Joint attention can be created through infant agency , in an attempt to gather information about a speaker 's intent .",

  "The loss of a royal court also meant there was no force to counter the Kirk 's dislike of theatre , which struggled to survive in Scotland . However , it was not entirely extinguished . The Kirk used theatre for its own purposes in schools and was slow to suppress popular folk dramas . Surviving plays for the period include William Alexander 's Monarchicke Tragedies , written just before his departure with the king for England in 1603 . They were closet dramas , designed to be read rather than performed , and already indicate Alexander 's preference for southern English over the Scots language . There were some attempts to revive Scottish drama .

It was performed at the Tennis @-@ Court Theatre at Holyrood Palace before the parliamentary high commissioner John Leslie , Earl of Rothes .

  "Coconut Crabs are considered one of the most terrestrial decapods , with most aspects of its life linked to a terrestrial existence ; they will drown in sea water in less than a day . Coconut crabs live alone in underground burrows and rock crevices , depending on the local terrain . They dig their own burrows in sand or loose soil . During the day , the animal stays hidden to reduce water loss from heat . The coconut crabs ' burrows contain very fine yet strong fibres of the coconut husk which the animal uses as bedding . While resting in its burrow , the coconut crab closes the entrances with one of its claws to create the moist microclimate within the burrow necessary for its breathing organs . In areas with a large coconut crab population , some may come out during the day , perhaps to gain an advantage in the search for food . Other times they will emerge if it is moist or raining , since these conditions allow them to breathe more easily . They live almost exclusively on land , returning to the sea only to release their eggs ; on Christmas Island , for instance , B. latro is abundant 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) from the sea .",

  "By July , it was becoming obvious that the ice was likely to crush the Endurance , which creaked and trembled under the pressure , and Shackleton instructed Worsley to be prepared to quickly abandon ship if the need arose . Worsley was initially incredulous , asking Shackleton : \" You seriously mean to tell me that the ship is doomed ? \" Shackleton responded \" The ship can 't live in this , Skipper . \" Finally , on 24 October , the pressure of the ice caused the stern post of the Endurance to twist and the ship began to quickly let in water .

  "The winter of 1906 – 07 was the coldest in Alberta history ; this was exacerbated by a shortage of coal .

  "Cnidaria have no brains or even central nervous systems . Instead they have decentralized nerve nets consisting of sensory neurons that generate signals in response to various types of stimulus , such as odors , motor neurons that tell muscles to contract , and \" cobwebs \" of intermediate neurons to connect them . As well as forming the \" signal cables \" , intermediate neurons also form ganglia that act as local coordination centers . The cilia of the cnidocytes detect physical contact . Nerves inform cnidocytes when odors from prey or attackers are detected and when neighbouring cnidocytes fire . Most of the communications between nerve cells are via chemical synapses , small gaps across which chemicals flow . As this process is too slow to ensure that the muscles round the rim of a medusa 's bell contract simultaneously in swimming the neurons which control this communicate by much faster electrical signals across gap junctions .",
  "Stage 4 , again mostly flat with an uphill finish , was another important day for the team . Evans approached the finish with a select group at the head of the race , including most of the race 's overall favorites and race leader Hushovd . Evans outsprinted Alberto Contador at the finish to claim his second career Tour stage win . After finishing safely in the peloton on the next three stages , all of them favoring sprinters , Evans took third , just behind Gilbert , on Super Besse in stage 8 . Despite the uphill finish and the stage 's bumpy profile , Hushovd also finished in this group , meaning Evans did not , as was expected , take the yellow jersey . Though the next day featured a change of race leader , when a breakaway including Thomas Voeckler gained almost four minutes against the peloton , Evans remained well @-@ placed in third overall . There were then no significant changes to the overall standings until stage 16 .

Schroeder , who shepherded Tim Burton 's Edward Scissorhands as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990 , suggested that Burton direct the film . Francis Ford Coppola 's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope ; Burton only became aware of Coppola 's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of Sleepy Hollow 's trailer and saw Coppola 's name on it . Burton , coming off the troubled production of Superman Lives , was hired to direct in June 1998 . \" I had never really done something that was more of a horror film , \" he explained , \" and it 's funny , because those are the kind of movies that I like probably more than any other genre . \" His interest in directing a horror film influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday — particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages . As a result , Sleepy Hollow is a homage to various Hammer Film Productions , including Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde , and other films such as Frankenstein , Bride of Frankenstein , various Roger Corman horror films , Jason and the Argonauts , and Scream Blacula Scream . The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s . \" One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase , and he brought in some layouts from it , so that was exciting . It was one of the things that maybe shaped what I like to do . \" Burton worked with Walker on rewrites , but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod 's bumbling mannerisms , and emphasize the character 's romance with Katrina .

  "The barn owl is nocturnal over most of its range , but in Britain and some Pacific islands , it also hunts by day . Barn owls specialise in hunting animals on the ground and nearly all of their food consists of small mammals which they locate by sound , their hearing being very acute . They mate for life unless one of the pair gets killed , when a new pair bond may be formed . Breeding takes place at varying times of year according to locality , with a clutch , averaging about four eggs , being laid in a nest in a hollow tree , old building or fissure in a cliff . The female does all the incubation , and she and the young chicks are reliant on the male for food . When large numbers of small prey are readily available , barn owl populations can expand rapidly , and globally the bird is considered to be of least conservation concern . Some subspecies with restricted ranges are more threatened .",

  "There is considerable evidence that the cerebellum plays an essential role in some types of motor learning . The tasks where the cerebellum most clearly comes into play are those in which it is necessary to make fine adjustments to the way an action is performed . There has , however , been much dispute about whether learning takes place within the cerebellum itself , or whether it merely serves to provide signals that promote learning in other brain structures . Most theories that assign learning to the circuitry of the cerebellum are derived from the ideas of David Marr and James Albus , who postulated that climbing fibers provide a teaching signal that induces synaptic modification in parallel fiber – Purkinje cell synapses . Marr assumed that climbing fiber input would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be strengthened . Most subsequent cerebellar @-@ learning models , however , have followed Albus in assuming that climbing fiber activity would be an error signal , and would cause synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs to be weakened . Some of these later models , such as the Adaptive Filter model of Fujita made attempts to understand cerebellar function in terms of optimal control theory .",

  "There is no simple way of differentiating a venomous snake from a non @-@ venomous one merely by using a scale character . Finding out whether a snake is venomous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of a snake with the help of experts , or in their absence , close examination of the snake and using authoritative references on the snakes of the particular geographical region to identify it . Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references , it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not .",

  "Like Charles II , Wycherley had spent some Commonwealth years in France and become interested in French drama , and throughout his short playwriting career ( 1671 – 1676 ) he would borrow plotlines and techniques from French plays , particularly Molière . However , in contrast to the French , English audiences of the 1670s had no enthusiasm for structurally simple comedies or for the neoclassical unities of time , place , and action , but demanded fast pace , many complications , and above all \" variety \" . To achieve the much denser texture and more complex plotting that pleased in London , Wycherley would combine several source plays to produce bustling action and clashing moods , ranging from farce through paradox to satire .",
  "Upon Carroll 's return to Maryland , Hart was incensed both at the threat to his own power and the idea of a Catholic officeholder in the colony . Hart demanded that Carroll take the oath of allegiance , which he was willing to do , and the oath of abjuration confirming the Protestant succession to the English throne , which Carroll was not willing to do . Carroll began to act in the capacity authorized by the proprietor 's commission , and Hart turned to the upper house of the colonial legislature for relief . Rejecting Carroll 's arguments in support of his right to hold government offices , the assembly resisted his attempts to exercise the commission and , near the end of 1716 , passed a series of laws confirming and restricting the oath requirements for officeholders , which were anti @-@ Catholic by intent . Carroll 's case may have been undermined when he came to the defense of his nephew , who had raised a toast to the Catholic James Stuart . Stuart had tried to take the British throne during a rebellion in 1715 and was extremely unpopular with Protestants in the colony . The proprietor , whose position had been so recently restored and who did not want to risk the loss of the colony , confirmed the decision of the assembly . Carroll 's commission was formally revoked on February 20 , 1717 . According to a later account Hart gave to the assembly , Carroll began a campaign to undermine the Governor . There is no evidence that Hart was accurate , but the assembly passed stricter anti @-@ Catholic laws in 1718 , including disfranchisement , stripping Catholic males of the right to vote .",

  "Other causes of a UHI are due to geometric effects . The tall buildings within many urban areas provide multiple surfaces for the reflection and absorption of sunlight , increasing the efficiency with which urban areas are heated . This is called the \" urban canyon effect \" . Another effect of buildings is the blocking of wind , which also inhibits cooling by convection and prevents pollution from dissipating . Waste heat from automobiles , air conditioning , industry , and other sources also contributes to the UHI . High levels of pollution in urban areas can also increase the UHI , as many forms of pollution change the radiative properties of the atmosphere .

  "The bushing plate is the most important part of the machinery for making the fiber . This is a small metal furnace containing nozzles for the fiber to be formed through . It is almost always made of platinum alloyed with rhodium for durability . Platinum is used because the glass melt has a natural affinity for wetting it . When bushings were first used they were 100 % platinum , and the glass wetted the bushing so easily that it ran under the plate after exiting the nozzle and accumulated on the underside . Also , due to its cost and the tendency to wear , the platinum was alloyed with rhodium . In the direct melt process , the bushing serves as a collector for the molten glass . It is heated slightly to keep the glass at the correct temperature for fiber formation . In the marble melt process , the bushing acts more like a furnace as it melts more of the material .",
  "The first attempts to regulate competitive ice hockey matches came in the late 1880s . Before then , teams competed in tournaments and infrequent challenge contests that prevailed in the Canadian sports world at the time . In 1887 , four clubs from Montreal formed the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada ( AHAC ) and developed a structured schedule . In 1892 , Lord Stanley donated the Stanley Cup to be symbolic of the Canadian championship and appointed Philip Dansken Ross and Sheriff John Sweetland as its trustees . It was awarded to the AHAC champion Montreal Hockey Club and thereafter awarded to the league champions , or to any pre @-@ approved team that won it in a challenge . In 1904 , the International Hockey League ( IHL ) , based around Lake Michigan , was created as the first fully professional league , which lasted for two seasons . In recruiting players , the IHL caused an \" Athletic War \" that drained amateur clubs of top players , most noticeably in the Ontario Hockey Association ( OHA ) . In the 1905 – 06 season , the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association ( ECAHA ) was formed , which mixed paid and amateur players in its rosters , which led to the demise of the IHL . Bidding wars for players led many ECAHA teams to lose money , and it eventually folded on November 25 , 1909 . As a result of the dissolution of the ECAHA , two leagues were formed — the Canadian Hockey Association ( CHA ) and the National Hockey Association ( NHA ) . Since the NHA 's owners were notable , wealthy businessmen , the CHA did not complete a season , as the NHA easily recruited the top players , and interest in the CHA teams faded . By 1914 , the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association ( PCHA ) league was launched and the NHA champion would play off each season against the PCHA champion for the Stanley Cup , ending the challenge era .",

  "Franco 's death in 1975 led to the beginnings of diplomatic movement between Britain and Spain on the Gibraltar issue , though not immediately . Spain applied to join the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and NATO , for which it needed British support . In 1980 , talks between British and Spanish ministers led to the Lisbon Agreement , a statement on co @-@ operation between the two countries which committed them to starting negotiations on Gibraltar 's future and lifting the Spanish restrictions on communications with Gibraltar . Although Britain promised to \" honour the freely and democratically expressed wishes of the people of Gibraltar \" , Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher indicated in the House of Commons that sovereignty would be on the table , in a change from the previous policy . However , the border was not reopened due to \" technical issues \" – code for unresolved issues between the two governments – and the agreement was strongly opposed by many Gibraltarians , who did not wish their sovereignty to be under discussion and objected to the lack of Gibraltarian representatives at the talks . The outbreak of the Falklands War in 1982 caused a further delay . Argentina carried out an unsuccessful sabotage operation , kept secret at the time , that was intended to sink a Royal Navy frigate in Gibraltar 's harbour ; the saboteurs were captured by the Spanish police in Algeciras before they could carry out their attack . A further agreement was reached in Brussels in 1984 which clarified the Lisbon Agreement and required that Britain allow Spaniards to live and work in Gibraltar , which they would have the right to do anyway as EEC citizens . The border was finally fully reopened on 4 – 5 February 1985 .",
  "As Jon Mee , a scholar of British radicalism , writes : \" Paine believed . . . a revolution in religion was the natural corollary , even prerequisite , of a fully successful political revolution . \" Paine lays out a vision of , in Davidson and Scheick 's words , \" an age of intellectual freedom , when reason would triumph over superstition , when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship , which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions . \" It is this vision that scholars have called Paine 's \" secular millennialism \" and it appears in all of his works — he ends the Rights of Man , for example , with the statement : \" From what we now see , nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable .

  "The skins or heads of taiko are generally made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged about three or four years . Skins also come from horses , and bull skin is preferred for larger drums . Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko , and thicker skins are used for larger ones . On some drumheads , a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance . Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month ; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal . To stretch the skin over the drum properly , one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several hydraulic jacks underneath it . The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks , and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead . Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension . Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes . Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers , clad in stockings , hop rhythmically atop it , forming a circle along the edge . After the skin has dried , tacks , called byō , are added to the appropriate drums to secure it ; chū @-@ daiko require about 300 of them for each side . After the body and skin have been finished , excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed .",

  "Another approach is to define a real number as the limit of a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers . This construction of the real numbers uses the ordering of rationals less directly . First , the distance between x and y is defined as the absolute value | x − y | , where the absolute value | z | is defined as the maximum of z and − z , thus never negative . Then the reals are defined to be the sequences of rationals that have the Cauchy sequence property using this distance . That is , in the sequence ( x0 , x1 , x2 , … ) , a mapping from natural numbers to rationals , for any positive rational δ there is an N such that | xm − xn | ≤ δ for all m , n > N.

Women in the video game industry describe the character as both a positive and negative influence . Ismini Roby of WomenGamers.com commented that Croft was not a sexist influence in 1996 , attributed to the lack of prominent female characters in video games at the time . She stated that the over @-@ sexualized appearance was overlooked because the character was a \" breath of fresh air \" . However , Roby felt that though Lara Croft 's proportions have become more realistic , the character 's personality was diluted by the developer 's actions to appeal to a male audience .

The density of impact craters across Io 's surface would have given clues to Io 's age .

Compared to most worlds observed to that point , Io 's surface was covered in a variety of colorful materials ( leading Io to be compared to a rotten orange or to pizza ) from various sulfurous compounds .

  "A combination of hieroglyphic texts from Tikal , Copán and Quiriguá , together with architectural styles and chemical tests of the bones of the founder of the Copán dynasty all suggest that Quiriguá and Copán were founded by elite colonists from the great city of Tikal as a part of its expansion into the southeastern border area of the Maya region . The recorded history of Quiriguá starts in 426 , in the Early Classic ( c . 200 – c . 600 ) ; according to hieroglyphic inscriptions at other sites , on 5 September of that year K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' was enthroned as king of Copán . Just three days later he installed \" Tok Casper \" , the first known king of Quiriguá , upon the throne . From this it is evident that right from the beginning of its recorded history Quiriguá was subservient to its southern neighbour , and was founded to bring the lucrative trade route of the Motagua River under the control of Copán and , indirectly , of Tikal . During the next few centuries , about which little is known , the ceremonial architecture at Quiriguá was limited to the hilltop Group A and a broad earthen platform on the valley floor . It is recorded that a stela , as yet undiscovered , was erected in 455 by Tutuum Yohl K 'inich , the second king of Quiriguá . An early monument records the supervision of a ritual in 480 by the then overlord from Copán , demonstrating Quiriguá 's continued status as a vassal of that city . A hieroglyphic text dating to 493 mentions two further kings of Quiriguá , but interruptions in the text make the reading and decipherment of their names particularly difficult .",

Anti @-@ colonialist and anti @-@ racist , the organisation demanded better working conditions , higher wages , and the abolition of unfree labor . The union quickly received the support of nearly 20 @,@ 000 plantation workers , together with that of the left @-@ wing French administrators placed in office by the Provisional Government . Its success irritated colonists to the extent that they took legal action against Houphouët , accusing him of being anti @-@ French for never seeking French citizenship . However , Houphouët befriended the Inspector Minister of the Colonies , who ordered the charges dropped . They were more successful in obtaining the replacement of the sympathetic Governor André Latrille with the hostile Governor Henry de Mauduit .",
  "TV Squad 's Bob Sassone enjoyed Jan Hooks ' appearance , and said that her role as Jenna 's mother was \" good casting . \" His only complaint was that this episode had nothing to do with The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan , the fictional show on 30 Rock , and hoped that no other characters have to stay at Liz 's apartment . \" Laughter wasn 't constant during [ ' Verna ' ] , but the direction it moved in kept interest even when jokes were sparse .

  "Little is known about the Beirut law school 's curriculum before the 5th century . The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide glimpses of the school 's teaching method , comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time . The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments , which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists , such as Ulpian . He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual , practical cases . This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies .",
  "On the north façade the mint building features a central projecting Ionic portico , supported by four monumental columns that are flanked at the ends by square pillars . The top of the portico contains a simple entablature , crowned by a flat roof in front of a simple , unadorned pediment . This entrance , which sits on top of a basement story , fronts the rectangular central core of the facility and is flanked by two large wings of multiple bays of rectangular windows . These wings wrap around the central rectangular core to form a \" W \" -shaped structure with two square courtyards at the rear . Balconies framed by iron railings and posts adorn the sections of the building 's south façade that adjoin the courtyards . Architectural historian Talbot Hamlin described it thus : \" it has those graceful , original proportions so characteristic of Strickland 's work . Even today [ 1944 ] , condemned to a use so different from that for which it was designed , it remains one of the most distinguished of the earlier buildings of New Orleans . \"",

  "Vieuxpont was one of only a few supporters of the king in northern England and he most likely began construction of Brougham Castle as soon as he acquired the land . At this stage , the castle would have been enclosed by an earthen bank surmounted by a timber palisade . The first three storeys of the stone keep date from this period . It was entered through the first floor via a forebuilding . To the east of this was a stone structure which was probably a hall . Building in stone was an expensive and time @-@ consuming process .

  "In Occupy , Chomsky explores both the context to the Occupy movement , and highlights its primary aims . He describes it as a reaction by members of the working and middle classes to the \" class war \" that has been waged against them by the upper class who control the commercial sector since the 1970s . During those 30 years , Chomsky argues , the nation 's wealth has become increasingly concentrated among a tiny percentage of the population , primarily those in control of the financial sector . Chomsky argues that this process has been furthered by government policies implemented by both the Republican and Democrat administrations , with both parties being financed by that same financial and commercial sector . According to Chomsky , while the wealth has been increasingly focused in the socio @-@ economic elite who control the financial sector , the rest of the population have suffered higher workloads , unsustainable debt , a weakening benefits system and stagnating incomes and real wages , causing them to be \" angry , frustrated , [ and ] bitter \" .

  "The Rhinemaidens have been described as the drama 's \" most seductive but most elusive characters \" , and in one analysis as representatives of \" seduction by infantile fantasy \" . They act essentially as a unity , with a composite yet elusive personality . Apart from Flosshilde ’ s implied seniority , demonstrated by occasional light rebukes and illustrated musically by awarding the role to a deeper @-@ voiced contralto or mezzo , their characters are undifferentiated . In The Perfect Wagnerite , his 1886 analysis of the Ring drama as political allegory , George Bernard Shaw describes the Rhinemaidens as \" thoughtless , elemental , only half @-@ real things , very much like modern young ladies \" . The attributes most apparent initially are charm and playfulness , combined with a natural innocence ; their joy in the gold they guard derives from its beauty alone , even though they know its latent power . However , this veneer of childlike simplicity is misleading ; aside from proving themselves irresponsible as guardians , they are also provocative , sarcastic and cruel in their interaction with Alberich . When the demigod Loge reports that the Rhinemaidens need Wotan 's help to regain the gold , Fricka , the goddess of marriage , calls them a \" watery brood \" ( Wassergezücht ) and complains about the many men they have lured away with their \" treacherous bathing \" . They are beguiling and flirtatious with Siegfried , but finally wise as revealed by the undisclosed counsel which they give to Brünnhilde .

Thus when examining sites for lunar significance the data can appear sparse due the extremely variable nature of the moon . See Moon for more details .",

The number of the quires is often found in the margin . Originally it must have been composed of 830 parchment leaves , but it appears that 71 leaves have been lost . Currently , the Old Testament consists of 617 sheets and the New Testament of 142 sheets . The parchment is fine and thin . The actual size of the pages is 27 cm by 27 cm ; although the original was bigger . The codex is written in three columns per page , with 40 – 44 lines per page , and 16 – 18 letters per line .

  "At the time of the Salisbury parliament , Hereford was accompanying two of the king 's daughters to Brabant , and could not be present . On his return , however , as Constable of England , he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service . The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick . The main reasons for the magnates ' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward 's continuous warfare in Wales , France and Scotland . In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey , the Archbishop of Canterbury , who was in the midst of an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation . At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm . For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king , after the humiliation and the affront to his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches . At a meeting just outside London , Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king 's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties . The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances .",

  "Construction of a connection between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875 . Because of the difference in level , a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark , using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system . A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank . The design was a success , but the fluid became contaminated , resulting in corrosion of the pistons . The lift was replaced by a new design , where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys , with small electric motors to overcome friction . The new lift was built over the top of the old one , so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready , and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation , supervised by the engineer J A Saner . It was completed in 1906 , and continued in use until 1983 , when it was closed on safety grounds due to corrosion .",

  "The development of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom , and this continued through the 1920s . In 1929 , King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , at which time the army became the VKJ . The army budget remained tight , and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s , it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries . Consequently , at the time World War II broke out in September 1939 , the VKJ had several serious weaknesses , which included reliance on draught animals for transport , and the large size of its formations . For example , Yugoslav infantry divisions had twice the number of men of contemporary British infantry divisions . These characteristics resulted in slow , unwieldy formations , and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower . Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast @-@ moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France .",

  "Upon his return to America , his newly imported horses became part of his Davenport Desert Arabian Stud in Morris Plains , New Jersey . By 1908 , however , the Davenport Desert Arabian Stud was listed in the Arabian Stud Book as located in Hingham , Massachusetts , and he remained closely affiliated with Bradley 's Hingham Stock Farm , which became the sole owner of the horses after Davenport 's death in 1912 .

Prior to that time , the Thoroughbred stud books of both the United Kingdom and the United States also handled the registration of Arabian horses . The reason a new organization , separate from the American Jockey Club , was needed to register Arabians came about largely because of Davenport . He had meticulously sought horses with pure bloodlines and known breeding strains with the expert assistance of Haffez , but once out of the desert , he was not aware that he also needed to obtain written affidavits and other paperwork to document their bloodlines . Additionally , because his Arabians were not shipped via Britain , they were not certified by the United Kingdom 's Jockey Club before arriving in America , and without that authentication , the American Jockey Club refused to register his imported horses . Another factor may have influenced the organization 's stance : in a cartoon , Davenport had satirized Jockey Club President August Belmont .",

Kydland and Prescott ( 1982 ) offered no formal evaluation of their model , but noted how variables like hours worked did not match real data well while the variances of other elements of the model did . When estimation methods are used , models are evaluated based on standard statistical goodness of fit criteria . Calibration is generally associated with real business cycle modelers of the new classical school , but methodological differences cut across ideology . While Lucas , Prescott , and Kydland are calibration advocates , another prominent new classical , Sargent , favors estimation .",

  "The commentary alternates between blank verse , free verse , and prose . Although Betjeman had accompanied the production on most of its shoots , his poetic commentary was only written in the weeks after the film had already been edited by Roberts . According to Mirzoeff , he would run sequences from the film for hours , searching for inspiration in the rhythm of the editing , sometimes sitting in a small cupboard to help himself concentrate . Mirzoeff notes that he found writing the text for A Passion for Churches more of a strain than for his previous film since he had to take into consideration both his own beliefs and those of his friends . Sometimes members of the crew would help him by writing their own verses for him to use or modify . One particular sequence proved so difficult to write that Betjeman flew into a rage after the director pressured him to hurry the composition along .

At the other extreme , the person with the white leśyā , having a pure disposition , thinks of picking up the fallen fruit , in order to spare the tree .",
  "Titania 's surface is intersected by a system of enormous faults , or scarps .

The most prominent among Titania 's canyons is Messina Chasma , which runs for about 1 @,@ 500 kilometres ( 930 mi ) from the equator almost to the south pole . The grabens on Titania are 20 – 50 kilometres ( 12 – 31 mi ) wide and have a relief of about 2 – 5 km . The scarps that are not related to canyons are called rupes , such as Rousillon Rupes near Ursula crater . The regions along some scarps and near Ursula appear smooth at Voyager 's image resolution . These smooth plains were probably resurfaced later in Titania 's geological history , after the majority of craters formed . The resurfacing may have been either endogenic in nature , involving the eruption of fluid material from the interior ( cryovolcanism ) , or , alternatively it may be due to blanking by the impact ejecta from nearby large craters . The grabens are probably the youngest geological features on Titania — they cut all craters and even smooth plains .",

  "The initial outline of what would become Licence to Kill was drawn up by Wilson and Maibaum . Before the pair could develop the script , the Writers Guild of America ( WGA ) went on strike and Maibaum was unable to continue writing , leaving Wilson to work on the script on his own . Although both the main plot and title of Licence to Kill owe nothing to any of the Fleming novels , there are elements from the books that are used in the storyline , including a number of aspects of the short story \" The Hildebrand Rarity \" , such as the character Milton Krest . The novel Live and Let Die provided the material surrounding Felix Leiter 's mauling by a shark , whilst the film version of the book provided the close similarity between the main villain , Kananga , and Licence to Kill 's main villain Sanchez . The screenplay was not ready by the time casting had begun , with Carey Lowell being auditioned with lines from A View to a Kill .",

  "Keyes was also criticized for his views on homosexuality . In an interview with Michelangelo Signorile , a gay radio host , Keyes defined homosexuality as centering in the pursuit of pleasure , literally \" selfish hedonism \" . When Signorile asked if Mary Cheney , Vice President Dick Cheney 's lesbian daughter , fit the description and was therefore a \" selfish hedonist \" , Keyes replied , \" Of course she is . That goes by definition . \" Media sources picked up on the exchange , reporting that Keyes had \" trashed \" , \" attacked , \" and \" lashed out at \" Mary Cheney , and had called her a \" sinner \" — provoking condemnation of Keyes by LGBT Republicans and several GOP leaders . Keyes noted that it was an interviewer , not he , who brought up Mary Cheney 's name in the above incident , and he told reporters , \" You have tried to personalize the discussion of an issue that I did not personalize . The people asking me the question did so , and if that 's inappropriate , blame the media . Do not blame me . \"",
  "Despite the great human cost , the Soviet Union under Molotov 's nominal premiership made great strides in the adoption and widespread implementation of agrarian and industrial technology . In a document written by Molotov he noted how cannibalism and starvation were still serious problems even in 1937 in the Soviet Union . Andrey Vyshinsky , the Procurator General , even told Molotov personally of incidents involving mothers eating their newly born children . The rise of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany precipitated the development of a modern armaments industry on the orders of the Soviet government . Ultimately , it was this arms industry , along with American Lend @-@ Lease aid , which helped the Soviet Union to prevail in World War II ( Great Patriotic War ) . Set against this , the purges of the Red Army leadership , in which Molotov participated , weakened the Soviet Union 's defence capacity and contributed to the military disasters of 1941 and 1942 , which were mostly caused by unreadiness for war . The purges also led to the dismantling of privatised agriculture and its replacement by collectivised agriculture . This left a legacy of chronic agricultural inefficiencies and under @-@ production which the Soviet regime never fully rectified .",

After the Battle of Wörth , a London journalist witnessed the Crown Prince 's many visits to wounded Prussian soldiers and lauded his deeds , extolling the love and respect the soldiers held for Frederick . Following his victory , Frederick had remarked to two Paris journalists , \" I do not like war gentlemen .

  "Published in 8 A.D. the Metamorphoses of Ovid has become one of the most influential poems by the Latin writers . The Metamorphoses showed that Ovid was more interested in questioning how the laws interfered with people 's lives than in writing epic tales like Virgil 's Aeneid and Homer 's Odyssey . The Metamorphoses is not narrated by Ovid , but rather by the characters inside the stories . The myth of Myrrha and Cinyras is sung by Orpheus in the tenth book of Metamorphoses after he has told the myth of Pygmalion and before he turns to the tale of Venus and Adonis . As the myth of Myrrha is also the longest tale sung by Orpheus ( 205 lines ) and the only story that corresponds to his announced theme of girls punished for forbidden desire , it is considered the centerpiece of the song . Ovid opens the myth with a warning to the audience that this is a myth of great horror , especially to fathers and daughters :",
