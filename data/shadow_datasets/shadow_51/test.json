  "Like other fairywrens , the superb fairywren is notable for its marked sexual dimorphism , males adopting a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue contrasting with black and grey @-@ brown . The brightly coloured crown and ear tufts are prominently featured in breeding displays . The breeding male has a bright @-@ blue forehead , ear coverts , mantle and tail , brown wings , and black throat , eye band , breast and bill . Females , immatures , and non @-@ breeding males are a plain fawn colour with a lighter underbelly and a fawn ( females and immatures ) or dull greyish blue ( males ) tail . The bill is brown in females and juveniles and black in males after their first winter . Immature males moult into breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching , though incomplete moulting sometimes leaves residual brownish plumage that takes another year or two to perfect . Both sexes moult in autumn after breeding , with males assuming an eclipse non @-@ breeding plumage . They moult again into nuptial plumage in winter or spring . Breeding males ' blue plumage , particularly the ear @-@ coverts , is highly iridescent because of the flattened and twisted surface of the barbules . The blue plumage also reflects ultraviolet light strongly , and so may be even more prominent to other fairywrens , whose colour vision extends into this part of the spectrum .",

  "The Percheron is a breed of draft horse that originated in the Huisne river valley in western France , part of the former Perche province from which the breed takes its name . Usually gray or black in color , Percherons are well muscled , and known for their intelligence and willingness to work . Although their exact origins are unknown , the ancestors of the breed were present in the valley by the 17th century . They were originally bred for use as war horses . Over time , they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods . In the late 18th and early 19th centuries , Arabian blood was added to the breed .

  "Eggs are almost invariably laid on plants . Each species of butterfly has its own hostplant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant , others use a range of plant species , often including members of a common family . In some species , such as the great spangled fritillary , the eggs are deposited close to but not on the food plant . This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter , as do violets in this example .",

  "Borscht 's westward expansion was less successful ; Germans used to scoff at the soup along with other East European fare . What helped familiarize Western Europe with borscht was the practice of Russian emperors , as well as Russian and Polish aristocrats , to employ celebrated French chefs , who later presented their own versions of the dish as a foreign curiosity back in France . One of the first French chefs to do so was Marie @-@ Antoine Carême , who worked briefly for Emperor Alexander I in 1819 . In his take on borscht , the original Russian soup served only as inspiration for an extravagant haute cuisine dish with an air of eastern exoticism . Apart from vegetables and beet sour , his recipe calls for a roast chicken , a fried chicken , a duck , a piece of veal , an oxtail , a marrow bone , one pound of bacon , and six large sausages , and suggests serving with beef quenelles , deviled eggs , and croûtons . Auguste Escoffier , Carême 's apprentice , who was mostly fascinated by the soup 's vivid ruby @-@ red color , simplified his master 's recipe , while also securing the place of potage bortsch ( \" borscht soup \" ) in French cuisine . Urbain Dubois and Émile Bernard , both of whom had been employed at Polish aristocratic courts , presented borscht to the French public as a Polish soup ; their cookbook , La cuisine classique , published in 1856 , contains a borscht recipe under the descriptive name , potage au jus de betteraves à la polonaise ( \" Polish @-@ style beet @-@ juice soup \" ) , which had been changed to potage barsch à la polonaise by the third edition in 1868 .

  "In early 1774 , he was appointed military governor of Massachusetts , replacing Hutchinson . He arrived from Britain in early May , first stopping at Castle William on Castle Island in Boston Harbour . He then arrived in Boston on 13 May 1774 , having been carried there by HMS Lively . His arrival was met with little pomp and circumstance , but was generally well received at first as Bostonians were happy to see Hutchinson go . Local attitudes toward him rapidly deteriorated as he began implementing the various acts , including the Boston Port Act , which put many people out of work , and the Massachusetts Government Act , which formally rescinded the provincial assembly 's right to nominate members of the Governor 's Council , though it retained the elected General Court . Gage dissolved the Assembly in June 1774 after he discovered the Massachusetts representatives were sending delegates to the extralegal Continental Congress . He called for new elections to be held as per the Massachusetts Government Act , but his authority was undermined by the representatives who refused to meet with the new , appointed Governor 's Council . He attempted to buy off political leaders in Massachusetts , notably Benjamin Church and Samuel Adams .

He announced that Constantine was dead , and took up the imperial purple . In spite of a large donative pledge to any who would support him as emperor , most of Constantine 's army remained loyal to their emperor , and Maximian was soon compelled to leave .

  "The ship struck another mine off Terschelling on the starboard side at 22 : 34 . The mine briefly knocked out the power system and temporarily disabled the rudders . Two of the three turbines were jammed , and the third had to be turned off . Another 300 t ( 300 long tons ; 330 short tons ) tons of water flooded ten watertight spaces in four main compartments . Only the centerline shaft was operational , which permitted a speed of only 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . Partial power was eventually restored to the starboard turbine , which allowed speed to be increased to 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . The shock damaged the rotating parts of all of the ship 's gun turrets , and three of the 15 cm turrets were seriously jammed . By 08 : 00 , Scharnhorst had reached the Jade Bight but ice prevented the ship from entering Wilhelmshaven . While waiting outside the port , Admiral Ciliax returned to the ship .

Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate , causing more attraction . This results in fights between males , in which their hard horns are used . It is 2 – 4 hours before a female allows a male to mount . Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period . The dominant male can mate with more than one female . Females have a gestation period of 9 months , and give birth to only one calf each time .",
  "The design of the He 111 A @-@ L initially had a conventional stepped cockpit , with a separate pair of windscreen @-@ like panels just for the pilot and co @-@ pilot . The introduction of the P variant triggered a complete re @-@ design of the cockpit . The He 111P , and subsequent production variants , were fitted with a fully glazed cockpits , laterally asymmetric nose , with the port side having the greater curvature for the pilot , offsetting the bombardier to starboard . The resulting stepless cockpit , which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats , no longer had the separate windscreen panels for the pilot . The pilot had to view their exterior flight environment through the same bullet @-@ like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator . The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator / bomb aimer on the right .

There was no cockpit floor below the pilot 's feet — the rudder pedals being on arms — giving very good visibility below .

  "Fictional invocations of Arnold 's name also carried strongly negative overtones . A moralistic children 's tale entitled \" The Cruel Boy \" was widely circulated in the 19th century . It described a boy who stole eggs from birds ' nests , pulled wings off insects , and engaged in other sorts of wanton cruelty , who then grew up to become a traitor to his country . The boy is not identified until the end of the story , when his place of birth is given as Norwich , Connecticut , and his name is given as Benedict Arnold . However , not all depictions of Arnold were so negative . Some theatrical treatments of the 19th century explored his duplicity , seeking to understand rather than demonize it .",

On the basis of this effect , he and Rossi demonstrated that the behaviour of these interactions is similar to that of penetrating showers .",

  "With the outbreak of World War I on 28 July 1914 , The Oceanides languished . Wartime politics being what they were , Sibelius 's music was seldom played outside the Nordic countries and the United States : in Germany , there was little demand for the music of an \" enemy national \" , while in Russia , Finns were viewed as being \" less than loyal subjects of the Tsar \" . In any case , many of Sibelius 's works had been printed by German publishing houses , a detail that harmed Sibelius 's reputation not only in Russia , but also Britain and the United States .

  "Discrete modern track and field competitions , separate from general sporting festivals , were first recorded in the 19th century . These were typically organised by educational institutions , military organisations and sports clubs as competitions between rival establishments . Competitions in the English public schools were conceived as human equivalents of horse racing , fox hunting and hare coursing , influenced by a Classics @-@ rich curriculum . The Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt is the oldest running club in the world , with written records going back to 1831 and evidence that it was established by 1819 . The school organised Paper Chase races in which runners followed a trail of paper shreds left by two \" foxes \" ; even today RSSH runners are called \" hounds \" and a race victory is a \" kill \" . The first definite record of Shrewsbury 's ( cross @-@ country ) Annual Steeplechase is in 1834 , making it the oldest running race of the modern era . The school also lays claim to the oldest track and field meeting still in existence , originating in the Second Spring Meeting first documented in 1840 . This featured a series of throwing and jumping events with mock horse races including the Derby Stakes , the Hurdle Race and the Trial Stakes . Runners were entered by \" owners \" and named as though they were horses . 13 miles ( 21 km ) away and a decade later , the first Wenlock Olympian Games were held at Much Wenlock racecourse . Events at the 1851 Wenlock Games included a \" half @-@ mile foot race \" ( 805 m ) and a \" leaping in distance \" competition .",
  "For the most part Cage avoids using lower registers of the piano , and much of the music 's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range . Of the forty @-@ five prepared notes , only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F # 3 : D3 , D2 and D1 . Furthermore , D2 is prepared in such a way that the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 ( resulting in two variants of D4 available , one more prepared than the other ) . The portion of the keyboard above F # 3 is divided into roughly three registers : low , middle , and high . The low register has the heaviest preparation , and the high register the lightest . Different methods are used : certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character ; others become drum @-@ like sounds , detuned versions of the original notes , or metallic , rattling sounds that have no sense of the fundamental frequency at all . The use of the soft pedal , which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note ( or one , for notes with only two strings ) , complicates the matter further . For example , the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed , but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released . It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this : certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note , others place special emphasis on particular notes , and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations .",

  "Some , such as Clark biographer Antonia Felix , have speculated that Clark 's inexperience at giving \" soundbite \" answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign .

He cited the off @-@ field problems as evidence that no UT player has been able to show the superior leadership skills of Vince Young . Mandel said that McCoy , still only a sophomore , had not been able to completely fill that gap and that McCoy 's play had not been as good as during 2006 . He also said part of the blame should be placed on an offensive line that lost several starters and had not been able to consistently protect McCoy . Finally , he noted that the running game had been \" equally inconsistent \" . The win over UT was the Wildcats ' first road victory over a top – ten team in school history .",

  "There are two schools of thought surrounding the decision to scuttle the battlecruiser . The first is that sinking Australia was a major blow to the nation 's ability to defend herself . Following the battlecruiser 's scuttling , the most powerful warships in the RAN were four old light cruisers . The battlecruiser had served as a deterrent to German naval action against Australia during the war , and with growing tensions between Japan and the United States of America , that deterrence may have been required if the nations became openly hostile towards each other or towards Australia . The opposing argument is that , while an emotive and symbolic loss , the ship was obsolete , and would have been a drain on resources . Operating and maintaining the warship was beyond the capabilities of the RAN 's post @-@ war budgets , necessitating the ship 's reduction in status in 1920 and assignment to reserve in 1921 .

  "The most characteristic initial physical symptoms are jerky , random , and uncontrollable movements called chorea . Chorea may be initially exhibited as general restlessness , small unintentionally initiated or uncompleted motions , lack of coordination , or slowed saccadic eye movements . These minor motor abnormalities usually precede more obvious signs of motor dysfunction by at least three years . The clear appearance of symptoms such as rigidity , writhing motions or abnormal posturing appear as the disorder progresses . These are signs that the system in the brain that is responsible for movement has been affected . Psychomotor functions become increasingly impaired , such that any action that requires muscle control is affected . Common consequences are physical instability , abnormal facial expression , and difficulties chewing , swallowing , and speaking . Eating difficulties commonly cause weight loss and may lead to malnutrition . Sleep disturbances are also associated symptoms . Juvenile HD differs from these symptoms in that it generally progresses faster and chorea is exhibited briefly , if at all , with rigidity being the dominant symptom . Seizures are also a common symptom of this form of HD .",

This then results in a specific area from which seizures may develop , known as a \" seizure focus \" . Another mechanism of epilepsy may be the up @-@ regulation of excitatory circuits or down @-@ regulation of inhibitory circuits following an injury to the brain . These secondary epilepsies occur through processes known as epileptogenesis . Failure of the blood – brain barrier may also be a causal mechanism as it would allow substances in the blood to enter the brain .",

There were no crimes committed , no trials , and no convictions : the Japanese Americans were political incarcerees . To detain American citizens in a site under armed guard surely constitutes a \" concentration camp . \" But what were the terms used by the government officials who were involved in the process and who had to justify these actions ? Raymond Okamura provides us with a detailed list of terms . Let 's consider three such euphemisms : \" evacuation , \" \" relocation , \" and \" non @-@ aliens . \" Earthquake and flood victims are evacuated and relocated . The words refer to moving people in order to rescue and protect them from danger .

  "Throughout the campaign , Lee was influenced by the belief that his men were invincible ; most of Lee 's experiences with the Army of Northern Virginia had convinced him of this , including the great victory at Chancellorsville in early May and the rout of the Union troops at Gettysburg on July 1 . Since morale plays an important role in military victory when other factors are equal , Lee did not want to dampen his army 's desire to fight and resisted suggestions , principally by Longstreet , to withdraw from the recently captured Gettysburg to select a ground more favorable to his army . War correspondent Peter W. Alexander wrote that Lee \" acted , probably , under the impression that his troops were able to carry any position however formidable . If such was the case , he committed an error , such however as the ablest commanders will sometimes fall into . \" Lee himself concurred with this judgment , writing to President Davis , \" No blame can be attached to the army for its failure to accomplish what was projected by me , nor should it be censured for the unreasonable expectations of the public — I am alone to blame , in perhaps expecting too much of its prowess and valor . \"",
  "The defence 's witnesses included some of those who had cared for Elizabeth Parsons and who presumably still believed that the ghost was real . Other witnesses included the carpenter responsible for removing the wainscotting from Parsons ' apartment and Catherine Friend , who to escape the knocking noises had left the property . One witness 's testimony caused the court to burst into laughter , at which she replied \" I assure you gentlemen , it is no laughing matter , whatever you may think of it . \" Thomas Broughton was also called , as was a priest surnamed Ross , one of those who had questioned the ghost . Judge Murray asked him \" Whether he thought he had puzzled the Ghost , or the Ghost had puzzled him ? \" John Moore was offered support by several esteemed gentlemen and presented Murray with a letter from Thomas Secker , Archbishop of Canterbury , who sought to intercede on his behalf . Murray placed the letter in his pocket , unopened , and told the court \" it was impossible it could relate to the cause in question . \" Richard James and Richard Parsons also received support from various witnesses , some of whom although acknowledging Parsons ' drink problem , told the court they could not believe he was guilty .",
  "The title Mother India was inspired by American author Katherine Mayo 's 1927 polemical book of the same name , in which she attacked Indian society , religion and culture . Written against the Indian demands for self @-@ rule and independence from British rule , the book pointed to the treatment of India 's women , the untouchables , animals , dirt , and the character of its nationalistic politicians . Mayo singled out the rampant and fatally weakening sexuality of its males to be at the core of all problems , leading to masturbation , rape , homosexuality , prostitution , venereal diseases , and , most importantly , premature sexual intercourse and maternity . The book created an outrage across India , and it was burned along with her effigy . It was criticised by Mahatma Gandhi as a \" report of a drain inspector sent out with the one purpose of opening and examining the drains of the country to be reported upon \" . The book prompted over fifty angry books and pamphlets to be published to highlight Mayo 's errors and false perception of Indian society , which had become a powerful influence on the American people 's view of India .",

Somewhat unusually , it is oriented in a North / South direction . A large proportion of the funding to build the chapel was provided by Lord Barnard , the local nobleman and a leading freemason ( with the remainder made up from public subscription ) , and accordingly the foundation ceremony was performed in full masonic regalia . The Grade II * listed building contains a painting by Ary Scheffer and a Father Willis organ .

  "While his captains enforced the blockade of Malta and Alexandria during September and October , Nelson was anchored in the Bay of Naples , enjoying the hospitality of King Ferdinand and Queen Maria Carolina of the Kingdom of Naples . Arriving on 22 September , Vanguard was greeted with over 500 small vessels organised by the royal family and led by a barge carrying Sir William and Lady Emma Hamilton . Over the next weeks , Nelson was taken into the court as an honoured guest , and has subsequently been accused of neglecting his naval responsibilities . It was at this time that his mutual attraction to Lady Emma Hamilton developed into a romantic affair . He also began to dabble in Neapolitan politics , successfully combining with Maria Carolina , the francophobe Queen , to encourage Ferdinand to go to war with France . Ferdinand ordered the Neapolitan army under General Mack to drive the French out of Rome . The resulting campaign was a disaster for the Neapolitans ; the French counterattacked and forced Ferdinand and his court to flee to Palermo in Sicily . The French established the Parthenopean Republic in Naples to replace the monarchy .",
  "Solitary and nocturnal , the Atlantic torpedo is capable of generating up to 220 volts of electricity to subdue its prey or defend itself against predators . Its diet consists mainly of bony fishes , though it also feeds on small sharks and crustaceans . It is an aplacental viviparous species , wherein the developing embryos are nourished by yolk and later maternally provided histotroph ( \" uterine milk \" ) . Females give birth to up to 60 young following a gestation period of one year . The electric shock of this species can be quite severe and painful , though it is not fatal . Because of its electrogenic properties , the Atlantic torpedo was used in medicine by the Ancient Greeks and Romans and became the namesake of the naval weapon . Prior to the 19th century , its liver oil was used as lamp fuel , but it is no longer of any economic value . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has listed this species as Data Deficient ; it is caught unintentionally by commercial and recreational fishers , but the impact of these activities on its population is unknown .",

  "The Era of Martyrs ( Latin : anno martyrum or AM ) , also known as the Diocletian era ( Latin : anno Diocletiani ) , is a method of numbering years used by the Church of Alexandria beginning in the 4th century anno Domini and by the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria from the 5th century to the present . In this system of counting , the beginning of Diocletian 's reign in 284 was used as the epoch , making Diocletian 's first year in power into the Year 1 of that calendar . Western Christians were aware of this count but did not use it ; Dionysius Exiguus replaced the anno Diocletiani era with his anno Domini era because he did not wish to continue the memory of a tyrant who persecuted Christians .

  "First described by Danish naturalist Erik Pontoppidan in 1763 , the red @-@ throated loon is a monotypic species , with no distinctive subspecies despite its large Holarctic range . Pontoppidan initially placed the species in the now @-@ defunct genus Colymbus , which contained grebes as well as loons . By 1788 , however , German naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster realized that grebes and loons were different enough to warrant separate genera , and moved the red @-@ throated loon ( along with all other loon species ) to its present genus . Its relationship to the four other loons is complex ; although all belong to the same genus , it differs more than any of the others in terms of morphology , behaviour , ecology and breeding biology , and may be the basal lineage of the genus . It is thought to have evolved in the Palearctic , and then to have expanded into the Nearctic .",

  "According to inclusive fitness theory , organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output , but also that of close relatives . In evolutionary terms , individuals should help relatives when Cost < Relatedness * Benefit . The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure . In haplodiploid species , females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs . Because a male is haploid ( has only one copy of each gene ) , his daughters ( which are diploid , with two copies of each gene ) share 100 % of his genes and 50 % of their mother 's . Therefore , they share 75 % of their genes with each other . This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what W. D. Hamilton termed \" supersisters \" , more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring . Workers often do not reproduce , but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters ( as queens ) than they would by having their own offspring ( each of which would only have 50 % of their genes ) . This unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality ( arising at least nine separate times ) within the Hymenoptera . However , some eusocial species such as termites are not haplodiploid . Conversely , many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial , and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males , creating half @-@ sisters that share only 25 % of their genes . Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality . But , monogamy ( queens mating singly ) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated , so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees .",

At 400 yards ( 370 m ) , the gunners shifted targets . Now aiming at the tracks and undercarriages , when the tanks raised up crossing low stone walls and rocks , seven tanks were disabled . For his conduct during this action , Rommel recommended that Montemurro be awarded the Iron Cross First Class .

A low voltage current is run through the water , and gaseous oxygen forms at the anode while gaseous hydrogen forms at the cathode . Typically the cathode is made from platinum or another inert metal when producing hydrogen for storage .

  "According to Genevieve Koski , Josh Modell , Noel Murray , Sean O 'Neal , Kyle Ryan , and Scott Tobias of The A.V Club , the ' 90s saw a \" dramatic increase \" in diagnoses of behavioral disorders , such as ADHD , in children , and debates over whether or not to medicate children with concentration difficulties were heated . Meyer , inspired by the debates , decided to write the episode to be about the subject . The episode criticizes how children with school issues are being misdiagnosed as having ADHD , as well as the prescription of psychostimulants to children in general . This in particular is shown in a scene in the Springfield Elementary schoolyard . In the scene , it is revealed that the general populace of the school is medicated for various misdiagnosed behavior disorders . Meyer himself was not entirely sure about his stance on the issue , however . He stated that \" for all I know , the drugs help [ the children ] and help the world . \" However , he went on to say that \" I just have a feeling they 're gonna be a disaster .

  "Several designs for new castles emerged that made keeps unnecessary . One such design was the concentric approach , involving exterior walls guarded with towers , and perhaps supported by further , concentric layered defenses : thus castles such as Framlingham never had a central keep . Military factors may well have driven this development : R. Brown , for example , suggests that designs with a separate keep and bailey system inherently lacked a co @-@ ordinated and combined defensive system , and that once bailey walls were sophisticated enough , a keep became militarily unnecessary . In England , gatehouses were also growing in size and sophistication until they too challenged the need for a keep in the same castle . The classic Edwardian gatehouse , with two large , flanking towers and multiple portcullises , designed to be defended from attacks both within and outside the main castle , has been often compared to the earlier Norman keeps : some of the largest gatehouses are called gatehouse keeps for this reason .",

  "Following the race the ACO and the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile ( FFSA ) national motorsport body investigated the incidents . The FFSA questioned the ACO 's decision to allow Mercedes to continue to compete after the two accidents prior to the race start , but the ACO argued that there were no indications that the problems that befell CLR No. 4 were shared by the other Mercedes entries . The ACO argued that the design of the CLR , with the longest front and rear overhang amongst the prototype field , was the cause of the problem . A Porsche 911 GT1 , similar in design to the CLR , had suffered a nearly identical accident the year before at Road Atlanta in the United States . The ACO changed the regulations for the LMGTP category in 2000 , decreasing the allowable length of overhang . The FIA also instructed its Advisory Expert Group to develop new regulations to prevent similar airborne accidents in other racing cars . The LMGTP class itself was abandoned by the teams in 2000 as Toyota cancelled its programme and Audi concentrated on open @-@ cockpit LMP cars ; the class reappeared in 2001 .",

  "The first threat from a railway came in 1825 , when there was a proposal for a line from Framilode Passage to Brimscombe Port . The canal tolls were reduced as a bargaining tool , but the promoters went ahead with their bill . The Stroudwater Company opposed it and it was defeated in Parliament . The Great Western Railway opened a line from Swindon to Gloucester in 1845 , which passed through Stroud , but the effects on the canal were rather less than the effects on the Thames and Severn . However , in 1863 the Stonehouse and Nailsworth Railway Act was passed , allowing the construction of a railway from Stonehouse to Dudbridge and Nailsworth that directly competed with the canal . Dividends fell below 5 per cent after 1880 although they did not cease entirely until 1922 . Around the same time the connection to the Severn at Framilode became blocked leaving the connection to the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal as the only link between the canal and the River Severn . The last toll was paid in 1941 , and most of the canal was formally abandoned by an Act of Parliament granted in 1954 . Although this removed the need to maintain the waterway for navigation , the Company of Proprietors was not disbanded , and retained most of their other powers . It consists of those who now own the original shares , although over half of the shares were transferred to a Trust in the 1950s , which prevents hostile takeovers and ensures that the company will always be run for the benefit of the communities through which the canal passes . After the closure of the canal the canal company continued to generate income for many years through the sale of water and some monies produced by property holdings .",

  "During the off @-@ season , Kariya became a restricted free agent before re @-@ signing with the Ducks to a one @-@ year , $ 10 million contract in July 2002 . Prior to the signing , the Ducks made two key acquisitions , signing playmaking centre Adam Oates to a one @-@ year deal and trading for winger Petr Sýkora from the New Jersey Devils . Both acquisitions were made with Kariya 's input , as well as with the expectation they would play on a line with him . Although Oates was injured at the beginning of the season ( during which time Kariya played with his usual centre , Rucchin ) , the trio formed the Ducks ' top line . Despite playing under a defensive system , implemented by new head coach Mike Babcock , the arrival of Kariya 's new linemates coincided with a resurgence in offensive production for him in 2002 – 03 . Several months into the campaign , however , his father died of a heart attack . The Ducks gave Kariya the option to sit out the following game against the Vancouver Canucks , which he played nonetheless on December 28 , 2002 . He recorded an assist in a 7 – 3 loss . At mid @-@ season , Kariya was selected as a reserve to his seventh and final NHL All @-@ Star Game , held in February 2003 . He scored the deciding shootout goal for the Western Conference , as his team beat the East 6 – 5 . While his 25 goals marked the lowest total of his career since his 22 @-@ game 1997 – 98 season , his 56 assists approached a personal best . With 81 points over 82 games , he led the Ducks in scoring for the fifth time .

Matching up against the second @-@ seeded Red Wings in the first round , Kariya opened the playoffs with a triple @-@ overtime winner in Game 1 , resulting in a 2 – 1 Ducks win .

It marked the second time in league history that a team eliminated the defending Stanley Cup champion in four @-@ straight games in the first round . The Mighty Ducks went on to eliminate the Dallas Stars and Minnesota Wild in the next two rounds to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in franchise history . During Game 6 of the series against New Jersey , a contest in which the Ducks faced elimination , Kariya received a hard open @-@ ice hit from opposing defenceman Scott Stevens . Laying motionless on the ice for several minutes , he needed to be helped to the dressing room . Many felt Kariya 's equipment changes following his first concussion may have saved him from being rendered unconscious from the Stevens hit . Four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minutes of playing time later , he returned to the game . Following his return , he scored on a slapshot while skating down the wing to give the Ducks a 4 – 1 lead . Anaheim went on to win the game 5 – 2 to force a Game 7 ; Kariya finished the contest with a goal and two assists . Reactions regarding Stevens ' hit were divided following the game . Kariya told reporters that after looking at replays that Stevens had used his elbow , while Ducks Head Coach Mike Babcock described it as a late hit . The play was not penalized during the game , however , and Stevens received no disciplinary measures from the League . Playing the deciding Game 7 in New Jersey , the Ducks lost the Stanley Cup by a 3 – 0 score . Over 21 games , Kariya finished third on the team in playoff scoring ( behind Adam Oates and Petr Sýkora ) , scoring six goals and 12 points .

For receptors located on neurons in the nervous system , the ultimate effect of D1 @-@ like activation ( D1 and D5 ) can be excitation ( via opening of sodium channels ) or inhibition ( via opening of potassium channels ) ; the ultimate effect of D2 @-@ like activation ( D2 , D3 , and D4 ) is usually inhibition of the target neuron . Consequently , it is incorrect to describe dopamine itself as either excitatory or inhibitory : its effect on a target neuron depends on which types of receptors are present on the membrane of that neuron and on the internal responses of that neuron to the second messenger cAMP . D1 receptors are the most numerous dopamine receptors in the human nervous system ; D2 receptors are next ; D3 , D4 , and D5 receptors are present at significantly lower levels .",

  "Natural selection within a population for a trait that can vary across a range of values , such as height , can be categorised into three different types . The first is directional selection , which is a shift in the average value of a trait over time — for example , organisms slowly getting taller . Secondly , disruptive selection is selection for extreme trait values and often results in two different values becoming most common , with selection against the average value . This would be when either short or tall organisms had an advantage , but not those of medium height . Finally , in stabilising selection there is selection against extreme trait values on both ends , which causes a decrease in variance around the average value and less diversity .

  "At the Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1994 , Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller took a phone call from Nakayama , in which Nakayama stressed the importance of coming up with a quick response to the Jaguar . Included on this call were Bayless , Sega hardware team head Hideki Sato , and Sega of America vice president of technology Marty Franz . One potential idea for this came from a concept from Sega Enterprises in Japan , later known as \" Project Jupiter \" , an entirely new independent console . Project Jupiter was initially slated to be a new version of the Genesis , with an upgraded color palette and a lower cost than the upcoming Saturn , as well as with some limited 3D capabilities thanks to integration of ideas from the development of the Sega Virtua Processor chip . Miller suggested an alternative strategy , citing concerns with releasing a new console with no previous design specifications within six to nine months . According to former Sega of America producer Michael Latham , Miller said , \" Oh , that 's just a horrible idea . If all you 're going to do is enhance the system , you should make it an add @-@ on . If it 's a new system with legitimate new software , great . But if the only thing it does is double the colors .... \" Miller , however , insists that the decision was made collectively to talk about alternative solutions . One idea was to leverage the existing Genesis as a way to keep from alienating Sega customers , who would otherwise be required to discard their Genesis systems entirely to play 32 @-@ bit games , and to control the cost of the new system . This would come in the form of an add @-@ on . From these discussions , Project Jupiter was discontinued and the new add @-@ on , codenamed \" Project Mars \" , was advanced .",

Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food . After Stanton had completed a draft of the script , he came to doubt one of the story 's main pillars – that the circus bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight . He felt the circus bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change . Also no particularly good reason existed for circus bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act .

  "In his judgment , Justice T. S. Sinnathuray considered Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs ( 1968 ) , decided by the Court of Appeal of England and Wales . He found that the procedural principles that govern the administration of Singapore 's immigration laws were similar to those in the UK . In Schmidt it was decided that an alien has no right to enter the country except by leave and the Home Secretary can refuse leave without giving any reason ; that if an alien is given leave to enter the country for a limited period he has no right to stay , and no legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay , for a day longer than the permitted period ; and that an alien 's application for an extension of his stay can be refused without reasons and without a hearing as the rules of natural justice do not apply . Furthermore , in Schmidt Lord Denning had espoused the obiter view that where an alien 's permit to stay \" is revoked before the time limit expires , he ought ... to be given the opportunity of making representations : for he would have a legitimate expectation of being allowed to stay for a permitted time \" . This argument was advanced by Siah 's counsel to persuade the court that \" an alien who is in possession of an entry permit which has not yet expired is in the country lawfully until the date of expiry and , therefore , he has an interest during the unexpired portion that carries with it a public law right to a fair procedure , if and when the minister desires to terminate that leave to stay prematurely \" . The High Court judge considered this proposition and conceded that it was an \" attractive \" one . However , he ultimately dismissed the argument by saying that it had \" not been supported by any English authority \" , and that the position in Singapore is \" quite different \" . He stated that Parliament had already provided in the Immigration Act for appeals and the right to be heard has been given statutory recognition and protection in the Act , and the applicant had already availed herself of the right to appeal . The Minister was not required to give reasons for his rejection of the appeal under the common law or the Immigration Act .",

  "The Endurance left England on 8 August 1914 destined for Buenos Aires , where Shackleton , travelling separately , would join the expedition . The departure of the expedition was troubled ; the impending outbreak of the First World War prompted some members including Worsley , anticipating a call up to the RNR , to propose a postponement of the voyage . However , the Admiralty advised Shackleton to proceed with his plans even after Britain declared war on Imperial Germany on 4 August . Just prior to the departure of the Endurance Worsley approached the authorities and was advised that RNR personnel were not being called up at the time . While steaming to South America , fuel ran low and wood intended for planned buildings at the expedition 's base in Antarctica was used to keep the engine running . Worsley ran a relatively relaxed ship with little discipline or control of alcohol consumption . Four crew members got into a barroom brawl at a stopover in Madeira , a neutral port . While anchored in the harbour , a neighbouring German ship swung into the Endurance , damaging it . Worsley , enraged , boarded the German ship with some other members of the expedition and forced the crew to repair the damage caused .",

  "Language serves as \" a vehicle for corruption \" , as Dussander tells Bowden horrific stories of his service at the fictional Death Camp of Patin . Bowden , in listening to the stories , becomes \" a vampiric extension of the evil \" that Dussander exhibits . The sharing of stories lead both Dussander and Bowden to have nightmares , and for Bowden , the nightmares are \" a past that is becoming ever more present \" . One of the key motifs of the film is that \" a door was opened that could not be shut \" , referring to Dussander 's confession about following orders and being unable to hold back . The motif is also conveyed in the scene in which Bowden forces Dussander to put on a Schutzstaffel uniform and to march to Bowden 's commands . Dussander continues marching despite Bowden 's insistences to stop , emulating the premise of the poem The Sorcerer 's Apprentice in which the untrained apprentice uses magic to enchant brooms and lacks the skill to stop them .

  "As Kainen ( 1990 ) described , a book embedding may be used to describe the phases of a traffic signal at a controlled intersection . At an intersection , the incoming and outgoing lanes of traffic ( including the ends of pedestrian crosswalks and bicycle lanes as well as lanes for motor vehicles ) may be represented as the vertices of a graph , placed on the spine of a book embedding in their clockwise order around the junction . The paths through the intersection taken by traffic to get from an incoming lane to an outgoing lane may be represented as the edges of an undirected graph . For instance , this graph might have an edge from an incoming to an outgoing lane of traffic that both belong to the same segment of road , representing a U @-@ turn from that segment back to that segment , only if U @-@ turns are allowed at the junction . For a given subset of these edges , the subset represents a collection of paths that can all be traversed without interference from each other if and only if the subset does not include any pair of edges that would cross if the two edges were placed in a single page of a book embedding . Thus , a book embedding of this graph describes a partition of the paths into non @-@ interfering subsets , and the book thickness of this graph ( with its fixed embedding on the spine ) gives the minimum number of distinct phases needed for a signalling schedule that includes all possible traffic paths through the junction .",

  "Viewership increased exponentially from the 1960s until the end of the century . This was due to the use of satellites to broadcast live television worldwide in 1964 , and the introduction of color television in 1968 . Global audience estimates for the 1968 Mexico City Games was 600 million , whereas at the Los Angeles Games of 1984 , the audience numbers had increased to 900 million ; that number swelled to 3 @.@ 5 billion by the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona . However , at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney , NBC drew the lowest ratings for any Summer or Winter Olympics since 1968 . This was attributed to two factors : one was the increased competition from cable channels , the second was the internet , which was able to display results and video in real time . Television companies were still relying on tape @-@ delayed content , which was becoming outdated in the information era . A drop in ratings meant that television studios had to give away free advertising time . With such high costs charged to broadcast the Games , the added pressure of the internet , and increased competition from cable , the television lobby demanded concessions from the IOC to boost ratings . The IOC responded by making a number of changes to the Olympic program . At the Summer Games , the gymnastics competition was expanded from seven to nine nights , and a Champions Gala was added to draw greater interest . The IOC also expanded the swimming and diving programs , both popular sports with a broad base of television viewers . Finally , the American television lobby was able to dictate when certain events were held so that they could be broadcast live during prime time in the United States . The results of these efforts were mixed : ratings for the 2006 Winter Games were significantly lower than those for the 2002 Games , while there was a sharp increase in viewership for the 2008 Summer Olympics , and the 2012 Summer Games became the most watched event in US television history .",

  "Very little is known about sea snake vision . A study of retinal photoreceptors of spine @-@ bellied , Lapemis curtus , and horned , Acalyptophis peronii , sea snakes found three classes of visual pigments all from cone cells .

However , behavioural observations indicate that vision has a limited role for catching prey and mate selection , but sound ( i.e. vibration ) and chemoreception may be important . One study identified small sensory organs on the head of Lapemis curtus similar to the mechanoreceptors in alligators and aquatic snake Acrochodus that are used to sense the movement of fish prey . Westhoff et al. recorded auditory brain responses to vibration underwater in Lapemis curtus , which are sensitive enough to detect movement in prey but were not as sensitive as fish lateral line systems .

  "The Tasmanian devil is the largest surviving carnivorous marsupial . It has a squat , thick build , with a large head and a tail which is about half its body length . Unusually for a marsupial , its forelegs are slightly longer than its hind legs , and devils can run up to 13 km / h ( 8 @.@ 1 mph ) for short distances . The fur is usually black , often with irregular white patches on the chest and rump ( although approximately 16 % of wild devils do not have white patches ) . These markings suggest that the devil is most active at dawn and dusk , and they are thought to draw biting attacks toward less important areas of the body , as fighting between devils often leads to a concentration of scars in that region .

  "The original \" old time \" or \" old type \" Appaloosa was a tall , narrow @-@ bodied , rangy horse .

  "Most states had placed restrictions on fisher trapping by the 1930s , coincidental with the end of the logging boom . A combination of forest regrowth in abandoned farmlands and improved forest management practices increased available habitat and allowed remnant populations to recover . Populations have since recovered sufficiently that the species is no longer endangered . Increasing forest cover in eastern North America means that fisher populations will remain sufficiently robust for the near future . Between 1955 and 1985 , some states had allowed limited trapping to resume . In areas where fishers were eliminated , porcupine populations subsequently increased . Areas with a high density of porcupines were found to have extensive damage to timber crops . In these cases , fishers were reintroduced by releasing adults relocated from other places into the forest . Once the fisher populations became reestablished , porcupine numbers returned to natural levels . In Washington State , fisher sightings were reported into the 1980s , but an extensive survey in the 1990s did not locate any .",

  "After the ship 's return from its cruise , a conference was convened aboard Argus on 19 May to consider revised landing arrangements . It was decided that a longer system of wires was needed , and the landing well system was abandoned in favour of ramps that could be raised and lowered as needed . Powered palisades were also needed on the side of the flight deck to help retain aircraft aboard that had not engaged a wire . The revised system was successfully tested aboard the carrier Eagle later in the year and Argus ' arresting gear was modified accordingly in time for the 1921 Spring Cruise , during which the ship carried ten Parnall Panther spotter and reconnaissance aircraft and three Fairey IIIC reconnaissance aircraft . In addition , the ship 's after lift was permanently locked in the raised position and 150 long tons ( 150 t ) of ballast were added to compensate for the additional weight of the equipment high in the ship . This cruise was deemed very successful as 45 landings were made , only two of which resulted in serious accidents , an accident rate comparable to those of land @-@ based units . The time required to launch two aircraft and land one aboard was forty minutes during this cruise , primarily because the rotary engines of the time were very difficult to start .",

  "Much of a temple 's economic support came from its own resources . These included large tracts of land beyond the temple enclosure , sometimes in a completely different region than the temple itself . The most important type of property was farmland , producing grain , fruit , or wine , or supporting herds of livestock . The temple either managed these lands directly , rented them out to farmers for a share of the produce , or managed them jointly with the royal administration . Temples also launched expeditions into the desert to collect resources such as salt , honey , or wild game , or to mine precious minerals . Some owned fleets of ships with which to conduct their own trade across the country or even beyond Egypt 's borders . Thus , as Richard H.

The RAAF team was officially formed in preparation for the 1943 season and Miller was selected . The captain was flying officer Keith Carmody . Miller played his first match at Lord 's , the home of cricket , against Warner 's XI , a team that included former England captains Bob Wyatt and Gubby Allen and future Test players Alec and Eric Bedser and Trevor Bailey . Oblivious to authority , Miller pushed a person in the dressing room out of his way before the match started , unaware that it was Warner , the secretary of the Marylebone Cricket Club himself . Warner 's XI batted first , and Miller dismissed Wyatt and Allen in taking 2 / 20 from ten overs as the hosts made 201 . Miller came to the crease at the fall of the first wicket and hit consecutive fours off the bowling of Dick Pollard from the Royal Air Force ( RAF ) . The RAAF were bowled out for 100 , with Miller top @-@ scoring with 45 . In the second innings , he made 21 not out with two sixes as time ran out and the match ended in a draw . In a match for the United Services against Sussex , Miller top @-@ scored with 134 not out in 120 minutes , striking 12 fours and three sixes .

He also played one match for Sussex against the RAF , scoring 11 and taking 3 / 41 .",
  "The three decades after the 1952 Grey Cup victory have been called the Argonauts ' Dark Ages . The team went thirty @-@ one years between championship victories and nineteen without even making an appearance in the final . Part of the reason was a salary cap introduced in 1953 that cost them many talented players . For the first time in decades , they began ranking at the bottom of the Eastern Division .

The second phase , which began in 1975 , was exactly the opposite ; the economy stopped growing , the collective leadership ended with Nikolai Podgorny 's removal , Brezhnev developed a cult of personality and the Soviet Union itself started to stagnate . Historians Jiří Valenta and Frank Cibulka noted in their book Gorbachev 's New Thinking and Third World Conflicts that Brezhnev 's legacy was a \" mixture of achievements and failures in both domestic and foreign policy \" . However , they argue that by the time of his death his failures had become severe chronic systematic problems . Brezhnev 's main achievements , according to Valenta and Cibulka , was his foreign and defence policies , however , with the economy in decline these achievements were not durable in the long @-@ run . They also note that the Soviet Union was able to consolidate itself as a superpower , which in turn increased their influence in non @-@ communist Third World countries .",

It also shifted airfields from Veurne in Belgium to Chipilly in France , leaving behind RNAS control by transferring to No. 14 Wing , 4th Brigade of the RFC .

The last three weeks of March were also filled with Dallas 's responsibilities for flight and gunnery testing . As British losses in the air began to mount during Bloody April , Dallas and his squadron moved airfields once again , to La Bellevue . They were thus positioned to take a prominent part in the subsequent Battle of Arras , where the intense aerial fighting saw Dallas add to his burgeoning score . The combat of 23 April became known as one of the classic air battles of the war . Dallas and his wingman Thomas Culling took on a squadron @-@ sized formation of 14 German aircraft , having gained an altitude edge over their foes . The naval aces exploited this edge by making quick diving attacks from opposite sides , culminating in short bursts of machine @-@ gun fire . Using the Triplane 's superior climbing ability , they would then bob back up to position themselves for the next assault . In contrast to the usual hit @-@ and @-@ run tactics of most dogfights , the RNAS duo launched at least 20 gunnery runs over 45 minutes . The Germans were forced progressively lower , into disarray , and then chased back over their own lines . While they shot down three of the Germans , Dallas and Culling also achieved a more important outcome by blocking and then breaking up a determined enemy effort against the British ground offensive . The action led to the award of a Bar to the Distinguished Service Cross for Dallas , and a Distinguished Service Cross for Culling , which were gazetted on 29 June .",

  "The British moved three fresh brigades up to the Red Line by 9 : 30 am on 10 April to support the advance of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division , whereupon they were to leapfrog existing units occupying the Red line and advance to the Blue Line . Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support the advance of the 2nd Canadian Division . By approximately 11 : 00 am , the Blue Line , including Hill 135 and the town of Thélus , had been captured . To permit the troops time to consolidate the Blue Line , the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward .

  "Mercury 's core has a higher iron content than that of any other major planet in the Solar System , and several theories have been proposed to explain this .

A similar process , known as the giant impact hypothesis , has been proposed to explain the formation of the Moon .",

  "Two main theories have emerged to explain the formation and evolution of the Jupiter trojans . The first suggests that the Jupiter trojans formed in the same part of the Solar System as Jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming . The last stage of Jupiter 's formation involved runaway growth of its mass through the accretion of large amounts of hydrogen and helium from the protoplanetary disk ; during this growth , which lasted for only about 10 @,@ 000 years , the mass of Jupiter increased by a factor of ten . The planetesimals that had approximately the same orbits as Jupiter were caught by the increased gravity of the planet . The capture mechanism was very efficient — about 50 % of all remaining planetesimals were trapped . This hypothesis has two major problems : the number of trapped bodies exceeds the observed population of Jupiter trojans by four orders of magnitude , and the present Jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by the capture model . However , simulations of this scenario show that such a mode of formation also would inhibit the creation of similar trojans for Saturn , and this has been borne out by observation : to date no trojans have been found near Saturn .",

  "One of the first mentions of a wall built against northern invaders is found in a poem , dated from the seventh century BC , recorded in the Classic of Poetry . The poem tells of a king , now identified as King Xuan ( r . 827 – 782 BC ) of the Western Zhou dynasty ( 1046 – 771 BC ) , who commanded General Nan Zhong ( 南仲 ) to build a wall in the northern regions to fend off the Xianyun . The Xianyun , whose base of power was in the Ordos region , were regarded as part of the charioteering Rong tribes , and their attacks aimed at the early Zhou capital region of Haojing were probably the reason for King Xuan 's response . Nan Zhong 's campaign was recorded as a great victory . However , only a few years later in 771 BC another branch of the Rong people , the Quanrong , responded to a summons by the renegade Marquess of Shen by over @-@ running the Zhou defences and laying waste to the capital . The cataclysmic event killed King Xuan 's successor King You ( 795 – 771 BC ) , forced the court to move the capital east to Chengzhou ( 成周 , later known as Luoyang ) a year later , and thus ushered in the Eastern Zhou dynasty ( 770 – 256 BC ) . Most importantly , the fall of Western Zhou redistributed power to the states that had acknowledged Zhou 's nominal rulership . The rule of the Eastern Zhou dynasty was marked by bloody interstate anarchy . With smaller states being annexed and larger states waging constant war upon one another , many rulers came to feel the need to erect walls to protect their borders .

Creed ( navigator ) , intercepted a Luftwaffe Ju 88 . The Beaufighter was guided to the Ju 88 approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) northeast of Whitby on the Yorkshire coast . The attack damaged the Ju 88 , but did not destroy it . Since the aircraft was not destroyed , this did not count as the squadron 's first outright victory . That came on 22 January 1943 , when Flight Sergeant B.M. Haight and Sergeant T. Kipling ( RAF , observer ) , flying a Mosquito II from RAF Acklington , were credited with a Dornier Do 217 , which was destroyed near Hartlepool . This was made possible because of \" night readiness \" , the ability to fly at a moment 's notice at night . By the end of the war , 75 3 ⁄ 4 victories had been claimed . The squadron flew 2 @,@ 972 sorties and accumulated 28 @,@ 150 hours of flight time . The squadron 's victories included 75 3 ⁄ 4 destroyed , 2 probably destroyed , and 9 damaged .

  "With Brezhnev 's position consolidated in the early 1970s , he used Podgorny to weaken Kosygin 's position as Chairman of the Council of Ministers by giving the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet some executive powers . With the help from Brezhnev Podgorny managed to make the Council of Ministers subordinate to the Presidium . However , these changes threatened Brezhnev , and Brezhnev would later order Konstantin Chernenko to take a look at the 1936 Soviet Constitution to find a way to weaken Podgorny 's position . As it turned out there were none , Podgorny 's position as head of state meant that he could in fact block any measures taken by Brezhnev to circumscribe his powers . Chernenko did come up with a solution , to make it law that the Party leader would also become the leader of the Government apparatus . The 1977 Soviet Constitution was drafted to weaken the position of Podgorny by making it law that the Party leader was in fact also leader of the Government . The draft which dealt with the leading role of the Party , and its clear supremacy , in Soviet society was approved by the Soviet leadership . The approval of the 1977 Soviet Constitution is considered Podgorny 's death knell .",
  "In adults and children over the age of 12 , linezolid is usually given every 12 hours , whether orally or intravenously . In younger children and infants , it is given every eight hours .

  "Fortunately , definitions of the SI units are quite different from their practical realizations . For instance , the meter is defined as the distance light travels in a vacuum during a time interval of 1 ⁄ 299 @,@ 792 @,@ 458 of a second . However , the meter 's practical realization typically takes the form of a helium – neon laser , and the meter 's length is delineated — not defined — as 1579800 @.@ 298728 wavelengths of light from this laser . Now suppose that the official measurement of the second was found to have drifted by a few parts per billion ( it is actually extremely stable with a reproducibility of a few parts in 1015 ) . There would be no automatic effect on the meter because the second — and thus the meter 's length — is abstracted via the laser comprising the meter 's practical realization . Scientists performing meter calibrations would simply continue to measure out the same number of laser wavelengths until an agreement was reached to do otherwise . The same is true with regard to the real @-@ world dependency on the kilogram : if the mass of the IPK was found to have changed slightly , there would be no automatic effect upon the other units of measure because their practical realizations provide an insulating layer of abstraction . Any discrepancy would eventually have to be reconciled though , because the virtue of the SI system is its precise mathematical and logical harmony amongst its units . If the IPK 's value were definitively proven to have changed , one solution would be to simply redefine the kilogram as being equal to the mass of the IPK plus an offset value , similarly to what is currently done with its replicas ; e.g. , \" the kilogram is equal to the mass of the IPK + 42 parts per billion \" ( equivalent to 42 µg ) .",

  "Isotype or class switching is a biological process occurring after activation of the B cell , which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody ( IgA , IgE , or IgG ) . The different classes of antibody , and thus effector functions , are defined by the constant ( C ) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain . Initially , naive B cells express only cell @-@ surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions . Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function ; therefore , after activation , an antibody with an IgG , IgA , or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen . Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes . Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching ; the variable regions , and therefore antigen specificity , remain unchanged . Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies , all specific for the same antigen , but with the ability to produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge . Class switching is triggered by cytokines ; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment .",

  "Although castle construction faded towards the end of the 16th century , castles did not necessarily all fall out of use . Some retained a role in local administration and became law courts , while others are still handed down in aristocratic families as hereditary seats . A particularly famous example of this is Windsor Castle in England which was founded in the 11th century and is home to the monarch of the United Kingdom . In other cases they still had a role in defence . Tower houses , which are closely related to castles and include pele towers , were defended towers that were permanent residences built in the 14th to 17th centuries .

He was taken next to a Field Ambulance post and from there to the Tafelburg hotel in Oosterbeek , now being used as a Main Dressing Station . Here he was operated on in the hotel 's billiard room where Major Guy Rigby Jones used the billiard table to perform surgery . A day later he was moved to a house opposite as the number of casualties increased . Because the aid stations were in the front lines of the Oosterbeek perimeter , they came under constant fire and he was wounded twice more . A mortar round shell fragment lodged in his left foot , and a later hit caused splinter injuries to his face and shoulder . On another occasion , as the battle seesawed around the aid post , Germans occupied his building . A British sniper shot a German rifleman , prompting a German sergeant to lecture the British about shooting at a Red Cross house . When the house caught fire he was taken outside and driven to a collection point from where German medics took him to Apeldoorn .",

  "Rodents , like all placental mammals except primates , have just two types of light receptive cones in their retina , a short wavelength \" blue @-@ UV \" type and a middle wavelength \" green \" type . They are therefore classified as dichromats ; however , they are visually sensitive into the ultraviolet ( UV ) spectrum and therefore can see light that humans can not . The functions of this UV sensitivity are not always clear . In degus , for example , the belly reflects more UV light than the back . Therefore , when a degu stands up on its hind legs , which it does when alarmed , it exposes its belly to other degus and ultraviolet vision may serve a purpose in communicating the alarm . When it stands on all fours , its low UV @-@ reflectance back could help make the degu less visible to predators . Ultraviolet light is abundant during the day but not at night .

  "Aside from the regular version of the song , an official remix of \" Loverboy \" was included on Glitter . The song 's main remix , titled \" Loverboy \" ( Remix ) , uses the same sample as the album version and retains all of Carey 's original vocals . It has a different introduction , the singing and spoken parts of Cameo are greatly reduced ( and are not credited ) , and additional raps are included by Da Brat , Ludacris , Shawnna , and Twenty II . Critics panned the song , agreeing that the inclusion on the former pair only made it more difficult to hear and understand Carey 's singing . Many described their inclusion as \" upstaging \" the singer , while others felt they made the song increasingly tumultuous . NME writer Elios Therepio rated the remix five out of ten stars , and claimed the song to have been a much weaker lead single than Carey 's \" Fantasy \" ( 1995 ) . Jim Farber from Daily News criticized Brat 's verse , writing how it \" cut right through \" the production . The Morning Call 's Len Righi described the remix as \" cloddish \" , while Jim Abbott from the Orlando Sentinel felt the song 's guests \" upstaged \" Carey .",

  "The conflicts between Moreno and Saavedra generated international reactions . Lord Strangford complained about the later actions of the Junta , such as the execution of Liniers , which were seen as more violent than the initial ones . Brazil was also concerned because many copies of the Gazeta were being distributed at Rio Grande do Sul , influencing their slaves with libertarian ideas . The Brazilian government sent Carlos José Guezzi to Buenos Aires , with the purpose of mediating in the conflict with the royalists at Montevideo and to ratify the aspirations of Carlota Joaquina to rule as regent . He met Saavedra in his first interview , in July , and got a positive impression of him . Saavedra said that if Carlota 's rights were confirmed by the Spanish monarchy , Buenos Aires would support her , even if it meant they had to stand against the other provinces . The following month he requested a representative for the Court of Brazil , offered Carlota 's mediation with Montevideo , and pointed out that Brazil had forces near the frontier , awaiting orders to attack the revolution . This time , Moreno resisted . Moreno rejected sending a representative , and told him that the Junta did not work for the interests of Brazil , but for those of the United Provinces . He rejected the mediation as well , considering that no mediation was possible under a military threat . Guezzi was immediately sent back to Rio de Janeiro on the first available ship . He described Moreno as \" the Robespierre of the day \" , and accused the Junta of attempting to build a republic .",

The 6th Army 's Chief of Staff — Major General Arthur Schmidt — argued that a breakout was unfeasible and instead suggested that Army Group Don take steps to better supply entrapped Axis forces by air .

  "For their first few years of service , the Invincibles entirely fulfilled Fisher 's vision of being able to sink any ship fast enough to catch them , and run from any ship capable of sinking them . An Invincible would also , in many circumstances , be able to take on an enemy pre @-@ dreadnought battleship . Naval circles concurred that the armoured cruiser in its current form had come to the logical end of its development and the Invincibles were so far ahead of any enemy armoured cruiser in firepower and speed that it proved difficult to justify building more or bigger cruisers . This lead was extended by the surprise both Dreadnought and Invincible produced by having been built in secret ; this prompted most other navies to delay their building programmes and radically revise their designs . This was particularly true for cruisers , because the details of the Invincible class were kept secret for longer ; this meant that the last German armoured cruiser , Blücher , was armed with only 21 @-@ centimetre ( 8 @.@ 3 in ) guns , and was no match for the new battlecruisers .",

  "The three dams , Rogers , Hardy , and Croton ( all owned and operated by Consumers Energy ) , are operated in different modes but in concert give a net run of river effect on water flow . The Rogers itself has little or no impoundment and runs in run of river mode , passing through as much water as it receives . The Croton and Hardy work in concert . The Hardy , which has a larger capacity reservoir , larger turbines , and is upstream of the Croton , runs in full peaking mode , meaning that the river flow is impounded and used to generate electricity during peak demand periods . This causes wide fluctuations in water flows and reservoir levels , typically with low outflow during the night when power demand is lowest . Full peaking was once very common but because of the outflow fluctuations , is now less common . However , with the Croton immediately downstream , and with no river segment ( the Croton impoundment stretches back to the Hardy outlet ) , it can be run in re @-@ regulation mode , allowing a natural flow rate to exit . The Croton reservoir level fluctuates inversely with the Hardy , rising during the day and lowering at night . Since the Hardy reservoir is so large , its reservoir level fluctuates about 4 inches ( 10 cm ) in total , while the Croton reservoir fluctuates about 9 inches ( 23 cm ) . During the winter and spring runoff , the Hardy is allowed to fluctuate much more . It can be drawn down up to 12 feet ( 4 m ) to meet winter power demand but is required to return to normal levels by the end of April each spring .",

Slaves of the god are always mentioned by name and own their own land ; their legal status is close to that of freemen . The nature and origin of their bond to the divinity is unclear . The names of common slaves show that some of them came from Kythera , Chios , Lemnos or Halicarnassus and were probably enslaved as a result of piracy . The tablets indicate that unions between slaves and freemen were common and that slaves could work and own land . It appears that the major division in Mycenaean civilization was not between a free individual and a slave but rather if the individual was in the palace . ·",

  "Whorf 's work began to fall out of favor less than a decade after his death , and he was subjected to severe criticism from scholars of language , culture and psychology . In 1953 and 1954 psychologists Roger Brown and Eric Lenneberg criticized Whorf for his reliance on anecdotal evidence , formulating a hypothesis to scientifically test his ideas , which they limited to an examination of a causal relation between grammatical or lexical structure and cognition or perception . Whorf himself did not advocate a straight causality between language and thought ; instead he wrote that \" Language and culture had grown up together \" ; that both were mutually shaped by the other . Hence , Lucy ( 1992a ) has argued that because the aim of the formulation of the Sapir @-@ Whorf hypothesis was to test simple causation , from the outset it failed to test Whorf 's ideas .",
  "Rope @-@ mounted teeth are important cultural objects throughout the Pacific . In New Zealand , the Māori know them as \" rei puta \" ; such whale tooth pendants were rare objects because sperm whales were not actively hunted in traditional Māori society . Whale ivory and bone were taken from beached whales . In Fiji the teeth are known as tabua , traditionally given as gifts for atonement or esteem ( called sevusevu ) , and were important in negotiations between rival chiefs . Friedrich Ratzel in The History of Mankind reported in 1896 that , in Fiji , whales ' or cachalots ' teeth were the most @-@ demanded article of ornament or value . They occurred often in necklaces . Today the tabua remains an important item in Fijian life .

Rosas had tried to remove him from power several times since 1845 , suspecting that the caudillo was nurturing designs for his overthrow . This was the trigger for military intervention , and Brazil sent a naval force to the Platine region , basing it near the port of Montevideo . The British Rear admiral John Pascoe Grenfell , a veteran of the Brazilian War of Independence and of the Cisplatine War , was appointed to lead the fleet , which reached Montevideo on 4 May 1851 .

  "The Spanish engaged in a strategy of concentrating native populations in newly founded colonial towns , or reducciones ( also known as congregaciones ) . Native resistance to the new nucleated settlements took the form of the flight of the indigenous inhabitants into inaccessible regions such as the forest or joining neighbouring Maya groups that had not yet submitted to the Spanish . Those that remained behind in the reducciones often fell victim to contagious diseases . An example of the effect on populations of this strategy is the province of Acalan , which occupied an area spanning southern Campeche and eastern Tabasco . When Hernán Cortés passed through Acalan in 1525 he estimated the population size as at least 10 @,@ 000 . In 1553 the population was recorded at around 4 @,@ 000 . In 1557 the population was forcibly moved to Tixchel on the Gulf coast , so as to be more easily accessible to the Spanish authorities . In 1561 the Spanish recorded only 250 tribute @-@ paying inhabitants of Tixchel , which probably had a total population of about 1 @,@ 100 . This indicates a 90 % drop in population over a 36 @-@ year span . Some of the inhabitants had fled Tixchel for the forest , while others had succumbed to disease , malnutrition and inadequate housing in the Spanish reducción . Coastal reducciones , while convenient for Spanish administration , were vulnerable to pirate attacks ; in the case of Tixchel , pirate attacks and contagious European diseases led to the eradication of the reducción town and the extinction of the Chontal Maya of Campeche . Among the Maya , ambush was a favoured tactic .",

  "Ivaylo left Tarnovo in the summer of 1278 , marched northwards and defeated the Mongols , pushing them across the Danube river . The situation to the south was more dangerous . The Byzantines launched an attack on a wide front along the Balkan Mountains from the Shipka Pass to the Black Sea . They failed to cross the mountains as the defenders held on until the Mongols were defeated and reinforcement could be sent . Despite the huge efforts and numerical superiority the Byzantines made few gains at very high cost . For instance , the fortress of Ktenia was seized after many assaults , the castles of Kran and Maglizh fell with heavy casualties for the invaders . The Bulgarian commander Stan fell valiantly during the defence of Boruy and many other of Ivaylo 's associates distinguished themselves in the war — Momchil , Kuman , Damyan , Kancho . All battles led personally by Ivaylo were successful — he fought at Studena and Pirgitsa — and by the autumn of 1278 the Bulgarians gained the upper hand forcing the Byzantines to abandon the campaign .

  "Typically , as a dead body decomposes , body tissues become depleted of oxygen and the body begins to putrefy ; anaerobic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract proliferate and as a result of increased metabolic activity , release gases such as carbon dioxide , methane , and hydrogen sulfide . These bacteria secrete exoenzymesNote c to break down body cells and proteins for ingestion which thus weakens organ tissues . Increasing pressure forces the diffusion of excessive gases into the weakened tissues where they enter the circulatory system and spread to other parts of the body , causing both torso and limbs to become bloated . These decompositional processes weaken the structural integrity of organs by separating necrotizing tissue layers . Bloating usually begins from two to five days after death , depending on external temperature , humidity , and other environmental conditions . As the volume of gas increases , the pressure begins to force various body fluids to exude from all natural orifices . It is at this point during the decomposition of a pregnant body that amniotic membranes become stretched and separated , and intraabdominal gas pressure may force the eversion and prolapse of the uterus , Note d which would result in the expulsion of the fetus through the vaginal canal . It has been observed that the bodies of multiparous womenNote e are more likely to spontaneously expel the fetus during decomposition than those who died during their first pregnancy , because of the more elastic nature of the cervix .",

  "In March 1907 , Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti , Ricordi 's representative in Naples , proposing three one @-@ act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky .

Finally , librettist Giovacchino Forzano presented the composer with two works of his own , which became Suor Angelica and Gianni Schicchi . The latter would be Puccini 's first setting of a comic text ; although his earlier operas , for example La bohème , contain comic episodes , these are merely ancillary to the drama to provide contrast .",

He did not join the Bolsheviks until 1918 , a year in which the Russian Civil War , between the Bolsheviks and a coalition of opponents known as the White Army , began in earnest . His biographer , William Taubman , suggests that Khrushchev 's delay in affiliating himself with the Bolsheviks was because he felt closer to the Mensheviks who prioritized economic progress , whereas the Bolsheviks sought political power . In his memoirs , Khrushchev indicated that he waited because there were many groups , and it was difficult to keep them all straight .",

  "Study has shown that the origin of charge is from certain types of subatomic particles which have the property of electric charge . Electric charge gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force , one of the four fundamental forces of nature . The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton . Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity , that is , the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system . Within the system , charge may be transferred between bodies , either by direct contact , or by passing along a conducting material , such as a wire . The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence ( or ' imbalance ' ) of charge on a body , usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together , transferring charge from one to the other .",
