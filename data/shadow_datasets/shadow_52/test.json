  "Don 't Look Now is particularly indebted to Alfred Hitchcock , exhibiting several characteristics of the director 's work . The aural match cut following Christine 's death from Laura 's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps , when a woman 's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train . When John reports Laura 's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes a suspect in the murder case they are investigating — an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait . The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène , by manifesting its protagonist 's psychology in plot developments : in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have run away from personal tragedy , and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice ; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings , and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her — both physical realisations of what is going on in his head .",
  "For the game , Crash Bandicoot co @-@ creator Andy Gavin programmed a new engine named \" Game @-@ Oriented Object LISP 2 \" ( GOOL 2 ) ; being three times faster than the previous game 's engine , it could handle ten times the animation frames and twice the polygon count . A flat plane z @-@ buffer was created for the game ; because the water surfaces and mud in the jungle had to be a flat plane and be exactly flat on the Y @-@ axis , there could be no waves and the subdividing plane could not be at an odd angle . The effect only worked on objects in the foreground and was only used on Crash , some enemies and a few boxes at the same time .",
  "Edward 's early demise caused great pain to both Richard and his parents : historian Alison Weir states that , from the time the Black Prince returned to England after Edward 's death , \" he was a broken man . \" Edward 's death also had a substantial impact on English history . Even during Edward 's lifetime , fears that John of Gaunt would claim the throne existed ; Parliament passed the Act of 1368 , which permitted children born in the English domains in France to inherit the Kingdom of England , perhaps fearing that the Act of 1351 , which established Edward and Richard 's citizenship as English , would not be enough to ensure their succession . After Edward III 's death and Richard 's ascension , a regency led by John of Gaunt was avoided . Nonetheless , Gaunt maintained his influential position in the years that followed , and acted as de facto regent until January 1380 .",

In 1847 , an edition of Lalande 's catalogue ( Francis Baily et al . ) was published , containing the majority of its observations , in which the stars were numbered in order of right ascension . Because every observation of every star was numbered and Epsilon Eridani was observed three times , it got three numbers : 6581 , 6582 and 6583 . ( Today numbers from this catalogue are used with the prefix \" Lalande \" , or \" Lal \" ) . Lalande assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3 . Also in 1801 it was included in the catalogue of Johann Bode , in which about 17 @,@ 000 stars were grouped into 102 constellations and numbered ( Epsilon Eridani got the number 159 in the constellation Eridanus ) . Bode 's catalogue was based on observations of various astronomers , including Bode himself , but mostly on Lalande 's and Lacaille 's ( for the southern sky ) , and an observer for Epsilon Eridani was Lalande . Bode assigned Epsilon Eridani magnitude 3 . In 1814 Giuseppe Piazzi published the second edition of his star catalogue ( its first edition was published in 1803 ) , based on observations during 1792 — 1813 , in which more than 7000 stars were grouped into 24 hours ( 0 — 23 ) . Epsilon Eridani is number 89 in hour 3 . Piazzi assigned it magnitude 4 . In 1918 Epsilon Eridani appeared in the Henry Draper Catalogue with the designation HD 22049 and a preliminary spectral classification of K0 .",

  "From the late 1940s to the early 1960s , the early days of the synthesis of heavier and heavier transuranium elements , it was predicted that since such heavy elements did not occur naturally , they would have shorter and shorter half @-@ lives to spontaneous fission , until they stopped existing altogether at around element 108 ( now known as hassium ) . Initial work in the synthesis of the actinides appeared to confirm this . The nuclear shell model , introduced in the late 1960s , stated that the protons and neutrons formed shells within a nucleus , somewhat analogous to electrons forming electron shells within an atom . The noble gases are unreactive due to their having full electron shells ; thus it was theorized that elements with full nuclear shells – having so @-@ called \" magic \" numbers of protons or neutrons – would be stabilized against radioactive decay . A doubly magic isotope , having magic numbers of both protons and neutrons , would be especially stabilized , and it was calculated that the next doubly magic isotope after lead @-@ 208 would be flerovium @-@ 298 with 114 protons and 184 neutrons , which would form the centre of a so @-@ called \" island of stability \" .

It took thirty years for the first isotopes of flerovium to be synthesized .

  "In the Shetland Islands , sand eels ( Ammodytes marinus ) normally form at least 90 % of the food fed to chicks . It was found that , in years where the availability of sand eels was low , breeding success rates fell , with many chicks starving to death . In Norway it is the herring ( Clupea harengus ) that is the mainstay of the diet . When herring numbers dwindled , so did puffin numbers . In Labrador the puffins seemed more flexible and when the staple forage fish capelin ( Mallotus villosus ) declined in availability , they were able to adapt and feed the chicks on other prey species .",

  "Antananarivo has expanded gradually from the royal palaces at its center , which dominate every view from their location at the peak of a curving ridge 200 m ( 660 ft ) above the surrounding Betsimitatatra plains . In the 17th century , the plains were transformed into paddy fields to meet the population 's need for rice ; they were covered with housing developments as the city 's population grew rapidly in the 20th century . Around the palaces , which were destroyed in a 1995 fire but have since been partially reconstructed , lies the historic district that was formerly populated by members of the andriana ( noble class ) ; many of their homes are preserved . The Analakely valley at the base of the ridge was the site of a Friday market established in the 18th century that , until being discontinued in 1997 due to traffic congestion , was considered the largest open air market in the world .

  "Developing neurons travel toward the olfactory bulb along the RMS via glial tubes , which mark the division between the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics . Uniquely , the cells travel tangential to the brain surface , parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons . Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe this is not the case . Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes . They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP ( glial fibrillary acidic protein ) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology . Furthermore , these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression , a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells . The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule , a polysialylated ( PSA ) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule ( NCAM ) called PSA @-@ NCAM , as well as β @-@ tubulin , a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts , proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb . With the removal of NCAM , the neuroblasts scatter , proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation . The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes . Once the developing neurons reach the core of the olfactory bulb , they detach from the RMS , which is initiated by Reelin and tenascin and move radially toward glomeruli , this migration is dependent on tenascin @-@ R , and differentiate into subtypes of interneurons . These neurons have been studied in vivo via electrophysiology and confocal imaging .",

  "The most obvious link between modern and ancient Greeks is their language , which has a documented tradition from at least the 14th century BC to the present day , albeit with a break during the Greek Dark Ages ( lasting from the 11th to the 8th century BC ) . Scholars compare its continuity of tradition to Chinese alone . Since its inception , Hellenism was primarily a matter of common culture and the national continuity of the Greek world is a lot more certain than its demographic . Yet , Hellenism also embodied an ancestral dimension through aspects of Athenian literature that developed and influenced ideas of descent based on autochthony . During the later years of the Eastern Roman Empire , areas such as Ionia and Constantinople experienced a Hellenic revival in language , philosophy , and literature and on classical models of thought and scholarship . This revival provided a powerful impetus to the sense of cultural affinity with ancient Greece and its classical heritage .

  "Britain had recognised Zanzibar 's sovereignty and its sultanate in 1886 , after a long period of friendly interaction , and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans . However , Germany was also interested in East Africa and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century . Sultan Khalifah had granted rights to the land of Kenya to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany , a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands . Many of the Arab ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade , which resulted in some unrest . In addition , the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate , which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population . One such conflict in Tanga claimed the lives of 20 Arabs .",

  "In October 1907 , the United States experienced a bank run on the Knickerbocker Trust Company , forcing the trust to close on October 23 , 1907 , provoking further reactions . The panic was alleviated when U.S. Secretary of the Treasury George B.

As well as preparing for airborne operations , the battalion also conducted amphibious training in late January and early February 1945 as part of a possible role in the amphibious landing at Balikpapan .

A few months later , the battalion was also warned to prepare for a mission to rescue thousands of Allied prisoners held by the Japanese at Sandakan in North Borneo . This operation , codenamed Operation Kingfisher , was controversially also cancelled due to a lack of aircraft , and the prisoners were subsequently killed by the Japanese in what subsequently became known as the Sandakan Death Marches .

  "Opinion over Mansfield 's intention in his ruling in Somerset 's Case is mixed , with the current prevailing view being that he did not intend to free the slaves . The judgment was particularly narrow , as it ruled only that a master could not carry his slave out of England by force , not that slaves who came to England were emancipated . This is seen as particularly telling because this was the primary argument of Davy and Hargrave . If Murray had wanted to emancipate the slaves completely , there were various bits of judicial precedent he could have based his decision on , such as Smith v Gould or Shanley v Harvey , but he did not . Various comments he made before and during the case also suggest that complete emancipation was not his intent ; in a preliminary judgment he said that \" the setting 14 @,@ 000 or 15 @,@ 000 men at once free loose by a solemn opinion , is much disagreeable in the effect it threatens ” , which one modern legal scholar interprets as indicative of his reluctance to make a decision for fear of economic consequences .

Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction ( low affinity ) with their antigen than the original antibody , and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction ( high affinity ) .

  "In the first half of the 19th century , Sleaford 's population more than doubled from 1 @,@ 596 in 1801 to 3 @,@ 539 in 1851 . Coinciding with this is the construction or extension of public buildings , often by the local contractors Charles Kirk and Thomas Parry . The gasworks opened in 1839 to provide gas lighting in the town . Sleaford 's Poor Law Union was formed in 1836 to cater for the town and the surrounding 54 parishes . The workhouse was constructed by 1838 and could house 181 inmates . Despite these advances , the slums around Westgate were over @-@ crowded , lacking sanitation and disease @-@ ridden ; the local administration failed to deal with the matter until 1850 , when a report on the town 's public health by the General Board of Health heavily criticised the situation and set up a Local Board of Health to undertake public works .

  "The walls stretch along the south of the town with eight towers and two gatehouses . The Upper Gate formed the main inland entrance to the town during the medieval period , and , in addition to its twin towers , was originally protected by a stone barbican , of which some stonework still remains – a rare survival for town barbicans of this period . A gatekeeper would have lived over the entrance during the medieval period . The original defensive ditch and drawbridge have been filled in , however , and replaced by a modern road . The second gatehouse , Mill Gate , was designed to allow access to the royal watermill that lay just outside the main town , and similarly features twin protective towers . In between the two gatehouses are the remains of Llywelyn 's Hall , a grand building originally built into the town walls by Edward I before being dismantled and moved to Caernarfon Castle in 1316 . Further along the walls is the mock @-@ Gothic archway built in 1846 to accommodate the local railway , possibly drawing on similar designs used in Chester . A unique set of twelve medieval latrines is built into the southern town walls , first constructed for the use of royal staff working in adjacent buildings in the 13th century .",

  "Religious language is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God . Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal , infinite , and timeless , ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity . This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult : a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good , yet also hold that God 's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness . This raises the problem of how ( and whether ) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all , which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life . The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God , in which she outlined her dilemma : she was simultaneously certain of God 's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him .",

Mirkin worked on the concept for a long time , basing the story on NASA 's Teacher in Space Project scheme to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public .

During re @-@ writes , Mirkin and the other writers placed greater emphasis on the relationship between Homer and his family and on Homer 's attempts to be a hero , but most of Mirkin 's original script was retained . The episode is considered one of the show 's best . Colin Kennedy of Empire magazine named it a \" contender for greatest ever episode \" , and in Chris Turner 's book , Planet Simpson , he says the episode is \" second to none \" . Regarding the long sequence that begins with Homer eating potato chips in the space shuttle and ends with Kent Brockman 's dramatic speech , Turner claimed that it was \" simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television \" . A copy of the episode was later sent to the International Space Station for astronauts to view .

  "A second important factor is the success of the IMF Stand @-@ By @-@ Arrangement in the country since November 2008 . The SBA includes three pillars . The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation , involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes . The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80 – 90 percent of GDP . A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out . A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world . An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010 . Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries , credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011 .

  "Griffiths sought a historical origin for the Horus – Set rivalry , and he posited two distinct predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus worshippers , similar to Sethe 's theory , to account for it . Yet the issue remains unresolved , partly because other political associations for Horus and Set complicate the picture further . Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler , two of its major cities were Nekhen , in the far south , and Naqada , many miles to the north . The rulers of Nekhen , where Horus was the patron deity , are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt , including Naqada , under their sway . Set was associated with Naqada , so it is possible that the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past . Much later , at the end of the Second Dynasty ( c . 2890 – 2686 BCE ) , King Peribsen used the Set animal in writing his serekh @-@ name , in place of the traditional falcon hieroglyph representing Horus .

Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age to those of the Como Bluff in Wyoming , from which Marsh described Brontosaurus .

Since Apatosaurus was the earlier name , Brontosaurus should be considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus . Because of this , Riggs recombined Brontosaurus excelsus as Apatosaurus excelsus . Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to Apatosaurus , Riggs also determined that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to A. excelsus .",

  "According to Hanegraaff , the question of death and afterlife is not a \" pressing problem requiring an answer \" in the New Age movement . A belief in reincarnation is very common , being viewed as part of humanity 's \" progressive spiritual evolution \" . In New Age literature the reality of reincarnation is usually treated as self @-@ evident , with no explanation as to why practitioners embrace this afterlife belief over others , although New Agers endorse it in the belief that it ensures cosmic justice . Many New Agers adopt a belief in karma , treating it as a law of cause and effect which assures cosmic balance , although in some cases they stress that it is not a system that enforces punishment for past actions . In much New Age literature discussing reincarnation , there is the claim that part of the human soul , that which carries the personality , perishes with the death of the body , while the Higher Self – that which connects with divinity – survives in order to be reborn into another body . It is believed that the Higher Self chooses the body and circumstances into which it will be born , in order to use it as a vessel through which to learn new lessons and thus advance its own spiritual evolution . Some prominent New Age writers such as Shakti Gawain and Louise Hay have thus expressed the view that humans are therefore totally responsible for the events that happen to them during their life , an idea that many New Agers characterise as empowering . At times , past life regression are employed within the New Age movement in order to reveal a Higher Soul 's previous incarnations , usually with an explicit healing purpose .",

Even so , Killer7 gained a significant cult following , effectively launching the career of creator Suda51 . Resident Evil 4 was the runaway success of the five , though its GameCube sales were undercut by the announcement of a Sony PlayStation 2 port to be released later in 2005 . Viewtiful Joe also saw a PlayStation 2 version with expanded features , and Killer7 debuted on multiple platforms simultaneously . Since the release of the Nintendo 64 , Nintendo has struggled to attract third @-@ party developers like Capcom to produce games for its systems .

  "In 1937 John Hicks published an article that incorporated Keynes 's thought into a general equilibrium framework where the markets for goods and money met in an overall equilibrium . Hick 's IS / LM ( Investment @-@ Savings / Liquidity preference @-@ Money supply ) model became the basis for decades of theorizing and policy analysis into the 1960s . The model represents the goods market with the IS curve , a set of points representing equilibrium in investment and savings . The money market equilibrium is represented with the LM curve , a set of points representing the equilibrium in supply and demand for money . The intersection of the curves identifies an aggregate equilibrium in the economy where there are unique equilibrium values for interest rates and economic output . The IS / LM model focused on interest rates as the \" monetary transmission mechanism , \" the channel through which money supply affects real variables like aggregate demand and employment . A decrease in money supply would lead to higher interest rates , which reduce investment and thereby lower output throughout the economy . Other economists built on the IS / LM framework . Notably , in 1944 , Franco Modigliani added a labor market . Modigliani 's model represented the economy as a system with general equilibrium across the interconnected markets for labor , finance , and goods , and it explained unemployment with rigid nominal wages .",

The population slowly grew to about 6 @,@ 500 . In the early 19th century Alexander , 10th Duke of Hamilton ( 1767 – 1852 ) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on the island 's population .

  "Kripke instead favored the \" unique and structurally interesting \" self @-@ enclosed episodes , which sometimes arose from the writers ' unused ideas . From the series ' beginning , Kripke desired to feature an evil clown because he felt that \" clowns in a context where they 're not supposed to be are friggin ' terrifying \" . To fit with the series , the clown became a shapeshifting Rakshasa of Hindu mythology . This decision made the clown \" less satisfying \" , to Kripke 's chagrin , because it limited the clown @-@ related scenes . Another element of folklore favored by Kripke was the story of Robert Johnson , which he focused on in his first screenplay as a writer .

To circumvent this , writer Sera Gamble suggested Johnson 's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks , with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more deals . Although Gamble envisioned the demon 's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a Rottweiler , Kripke felt it would \" look stupid \" .

  "Because of its low mass , the interior of the star is completely convective , causing energy to be transferred to the exterior by the physical movement of plasma rather than through radiative processes . This convection means that the helium ash left over from the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen does not accumulate at the core , but is instead circulated throughout the star . Unlike the Sun , which will only burn through about 10 % of its total hydrogen supply before leaving the main sequence , Proxima Centauri will consume nearly all of its fuel before the fusion of hydrogen comes to an end .",

  "Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms ( speech , fear , and religion ) ; this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration .

This was a slum where Irish immigrants and free black people lived amidst brothels , dance houses , and saloons where black people regularly danced . The Irish and black populations intermingled and borrowed elements of folk culture from each other . One area of exchange was dance , and the Irish jig blended with black folk steps . In this environment , Juba learned to dance from his peers , including \" Uncle \" Jim Lowe , a black jig and reel dancer who performed in low @-@ brow establishments . Juba was dancing for food and tossed coins by the early 1840s . Winter speculated that by about age 15 , Juba had no family .",

  "Carte 's first London season , at the Prince 's Theatre , 1919 – 20 , featured ten of the thirteen extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas . These included Princess Ida , which had its first London performances since the original production . The new productions retained the text and music of the original 1870s and 1880s productions , and director J. M. Gordon preserved much of Gilbert 's original direction . As his parents had done , Carte licensed the operas to the J. C. Williamson company and to amateur companies , but he required all licensees to present them in approved productions that closely followed the libretto , score and D 'Oyly Carte production stagings . In an interview with The Times in 1922 , Carte said that the Savoy \" tradition \" was an expression that was frequently misunderstood : \" It did not by any means imply any hidebound stage ' business ' or an attempt to standardize the performances of artists so as to check their individual method of expression . All that it implied , in his view , was the highest possible standard of production – with especial attention to clear enunciation ....

  "A photon is an elementary particle , the quantum of all forms of electromagnetic radiation including light . It is the force carrier for electromagnetic force , even when static via virtual photons . The photon has zero rest mass and as a result , the interactions of this force with matter at long distance are observable at the microscopic and macroscopic levels . Like all elementary particles , photons are currently best explained by quantum mechanics but exhibit wave – particle duality , exhibiting properties of both waves and particles . For example , a single photon may be refracted by a lens and exhibit wave interference with itself , and it can behave as a particle with definite and finite measurable position and momentum .

Kafur , the Ikhshidid army 's leader , did not press his advantage , but instead began negotiations . For the Ikhshidids , the maintenance of Aleppo was less important than southern Syria with Damascus , which was Egypt 's eastern bulwark .

Furthermore , the Ikhshidids realized that they would have difficulty in asserting and maintaining control over northern Syria and Cilicia , which were traditionally oriented more towards the Jazira and Iraq .

  "Some of the driest land in the Everglades is pineland ( also called pine rockland ) ecosystem , located in the highest part of the Everglades with little to no hydroperiod . Some floors , however , may have flooded solution holes or puddles for a few months at a time . The most significant feature of the pineland is the single species of South Florida slash pine ( Pinus elliottii ) . Pineland communities require fire to maintain them , and the trees have several adaptations that simultaneously promote and resist fire . The sandy floor of the pine forest is covered with dry pine needles that are highly flammable . South Florida slash pines are insulated by their bark to protect them from heat . Fire eliminates competing vegetation on the forest floor , and opens pine cones to germinate seeds . A period without significant fire can turn pineland into a hardwood hammock as larger trees overtake the slash pines . The understory shrubs in pine rocklands are the fire @-@ resistant saw palmetto ( Serenoa repens ) , cabbage palm ( Sabal palmetto ) , and West Indian lilac ( Tetrazygia bicolor ) .

  "The most basic step in evaluating a position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides . The point values used for this purpose are based on experience ; usually pawns are considered worth one point , knights and bishops about three points each , rooks about five points ( the value difference between a rook and a bishop or knight being known as the exchange ) , and queens about nine points . The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined , since its checkmate loses the game . But in practical terms , in the endgame the king as a fighting piece is generally more powerful than a bishop or knight but less powerful than a rook . These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece ( for example , advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares ) , coordination between pieces ( for example , a pair of bishops usually coordinate better than a bishop and a knight ) , or the type of position ( knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions ) .",

  "In 1885 – 87 the partnership designed Abbeystead House for the 4th Earl of Sefton in North Lancashire . Hubbard describes this as \" the finest of Douglas 's Elizabethan houses , and one of the largest which he ever designed \" . During this time additions were made to Jodrell Hall in Cheshire and Halkyn Castle in Flintshire . In 1885 the Castle Hotel at Conwy , Caernarfonshire , was remodelled , and in 1887 – 88 a strongroom was added to Hawarden Castle , followed by a porch in 1890 . During this period more buildings were added to the Eaton Hall estate , and these included houses and cottages , such as Eccleston Hill , and Eccleston Ferry House , and farms such as Saighton Lane Farm . In 1890 – 91 an obelisk was built in the Belgrave Avenue approach to Eaton Hall . The last house designed by Douglas on a large scale was Brocksford Hall ( 1893 ) in Derbyshire . This was a country house in Elizabethan style using diapered brick and stone dressings with a clock tower . In Chester city centre , 38 Bridge Street ( 1897 ) is a timber @-@ framed shop that incorporates a section of Chester Rows and contains heavily decorated carving . From 1892 the partnership designed houses and cottages in Port Sunlight for Lever Brothers . Also in the village they designed the Dell Bridge ( 1894 ) , and the school ( 1894 – 96 ) , which is now called the Lyceum . In 1896 Douglas designed a house for himself , Walmoor Hill in Dee Banks , Chester , in Elizabethan style . Between 1895 and 1897 he designed a range of buildings on the east side of St Werburgh Street in the centre of Chester . At its south end , on the corner of Eastgate Street , is a bank whose ground storey is built in stone , and behind this leading up St Werburgh Street , the ground storey consists of shop fronts . Above this the range consists of two storeys plus an attic , which are covered in highly ornamented timber @-@ framing . On the first floor is a series of oriel windows , the second floor is jettied , and at the top are eleven gables . Pevsner considers that this range of buildings is \" Douglas at his best ( though also at his showiest ) \" .

  "Isopoda is an order of crustaceans which includes woodlice and their relatives . Isopods live in the sea , in fresh water , or on land , and most are small greyish or whitish animals with rigid , segmented exoskeletons . They have two pairs of antennae , seven pairs of jointed limbs on the thorax , and five pairs of branching appendages on the abdomen that are used in respiration . Females brood their young in a pouch under their thorax . Isopods have various feeding methods : some eat dead or decaying plant and animal matter , others are grazers or strain food particles from the water around them , a few are predators , and some are internal or external parasites , mostly of fishes . Aquatic species mostly live on the seabed or bottom of freshwater bodies of water , but some more derived taxa can swim for a short distance . Terrestrial forms move around by crawling and tend to be found in cool , moist places . Some species are able to roll themselves into a ball to conserve moisture or as a defence mechanism .",

  "Titanosaurians were a flourishing group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times . The Spanish locality from the latest Cretaceous of “ Lo Hueco ” yielded a relatively well preserved , titanosaurian braincase , which shares a number of unique features with A. atacis from France . However , it appeared to differ from A. atacis in some traits also . The specimen has been provisionally identified as Ampelosaurus sp .. A. sp. is most likely a mature titanosaurian since the bones of the braincase have largely fused together .",
  "Grey herons have the ability to live in cities where habitats and nesting space are available . In the Netherlands , the grey heron has established itself over the past decades in great numbers in urban environments . In cities such as Amsterdam , they are ever present and well adapted to modern city life . They hunt as usual , but also visit street markets and snackbars . Some individuals make use of people feeding them at their homes or share the catch of recreational fishermen . Similar behaviour on a smaller scale has been reported in Ireland . Garden ponds stocked with ornamental fish are attractive to herons , and may provide young birds with a learning opportunity on how to catch easy prey .",
  "Herpetologist Wilfred T. Neill , reported in 1950 that he unearthed a bowfin aestivating in a chamber 4 inches ( 10 cm ) below the ground surface , 8 inches ( 20 cm ) in diameter , .25 miles ( 0 @.@ 4 km ) from a river . It was further noted that flood levels had previously reached the area , and receded . It is not unusual for riverine species like bowfin to move into backwaters with flood currents , and become trapped when water levels recede . While aestivation is anecdotally documented by multiple researchers , laboratory experiments have suggested instead that bowfin are physiologically incapable of surviving more than three to five days of air exposure . However , no field manipulation has been performed . Regardless of the lack of evidence confirming the bowfin 's ability to aestivate , it has been noted that bowfin can survive prolonged conditions of exposure to air because they have the ability to breathe air . Their gill filaments and lamellae are rigid in structure which helps prevent the lamellae from collapsing and aids gas exchange even during air exposure .",

  "The first ionisation energy of an element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge + 1 . The factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge , the amount of shielding by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus , which is always an outer electron in main group elements . The first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels . Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge ( + 1 ) , the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus . Since this distance increases down the group , the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases . ( This trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of the 7s orbital , bringing francium 's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non @-@ relativistic calculations . This makes francium 's outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus , increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium . )",

  "At the council , Walter de Lucy produced William I 's foundation charter and the confirmation by King Henry I of England , Henry II 's grandfather . Both documents were admitted as genuine , and as freeing the abbey from ecclesiastical oversight , as Henry II had at his coronation confirmed all his grandfather 's charters . Modern scholarship has shown , however , that at least one of the documents had been recently forged , shortly before 1155 . Hilary argued that only a papal privilege could exempt a monastery from episcopal oversight , and that the abbey had no such privilege . Hilary argued that no king could grant such an exemption , unless they had a licence from the papacy . Henry was unimpressed by this argument , for it impinged on his royal prerogative . Thomas Becket , then Henry 's chancellor but later to be famous for his dispute with Henry over ecclesiastical privileges , was one of Hilary 's chief opponents at this council . Eventually , the case was decided by persuading Hilary to renounce any episcopal claims on the abbey .",

  "The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual maturity at 4 years of age in the wild and at 3 years in captivity . The species usually reproduces once a year between the months of January and July ( the dry season ) . Copulation between pairs seems to be closely related to food transfers , with this possibly serving as a trigger for intercourse . Amazons have a copulation pattern similar to that found in other parrots throughout the Americas , with the male gripping a perch with one leg while passively placing the other in the female 's back . As the time for egg @-@ laying approaches the pair spends more time in the nest , with the male providing food to the female via regurgitation . The female lays 2 – 4 eggs that she exclusively incubates for a period of 24 to 28 days , while the male will be present in the vicinity of the nest when providing food . Females only leave the nest on rare occasions involving repelling predators or if the male has not brought food in an extended time frame . The chicks are fed by both parents until they leave the nest , usually 60 to 65 days after they hatch . Nonetheless , they remain dependent on their parents and travel with them until the next breeding season .",

  "Although Balzac did not draw specifically from the women in his life to create Valérie , parallels have been observed in some areas . The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is similar in some ways to Valérie 's manipulation of Steinbock . Critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska 's pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Valérie conceives and loses her child . Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Valérie 's treacherous character , he felt a devotion similar to that of Hulot .

  "A few of the Acadians migrating to the Miramichi River probably died of hypothermia during the trip due to the 1758 – 59 winter . Those who survived joined the refugees already present , who had been persuaded by Boishébert to seek refuge there . Inadequate housing and supplies , among other reasons , led to the deterioration of the reputation of the French commander , and only 700 Acadians remained there by late 1759 .

Libration also changes the angle from which the Moon is seen , allowing about 59 % of its surface to be seen from Earth ( but only half at any instant ) . The cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces moonquakes . Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than earthquakes , although they can last for up to an hour — a significantly longer time than terrestrial earthquakes — because of the absence of water to damp out the seismic vibrations .

The erasure of DeVine from the narrative places the white female bodies as the only true victims of crime ; and the film 's inability to show DeVine as violated rather than violator perpetuates the myth of the black man as always already a perpetrator of crime . \" Regarding Devine , Halberstam wrote , \" Peirce perhaps thought that her film , already running close to two hours , could not handle another subplot , but the story of Philip DeVine is important and it is a crucial part of the drama of gender , race , sexuality , and class that was enacted in the heartland . Race is not incidental to this narrative of mostly white , Midwestern small towns and by omitting DeVine 's story from Boys Don 't Cry , Peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race , consigning the memory of DeVine to oblivion . \"",

  "River otters typically breed from December to April . Copulation lasts from 16 – 73 minutes and may occur in water or on land . During the breeding , the male grabs the female by the neck with his teeth . Copulation is vigorous , and is interrupted by periods of rest . Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating . Female estrus lasts about a month per year , and true gestation lasts 61 – 63 days . Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months , the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10 – 12 months . Delayed implantation distinguishes the species from the European otter , which lacks this feature . Young are born between February and April , and parturition lasts three to eight hours .",

  "By the end of the series , events converge with accepted history , when King Richard IV and his entire family are poisoned , allowing Henry Tudor to take the throne as King Henry VII . He then rewrites history , presenting Richard III as a monster , and eliminating Richard IV 's reign from the history books . In reality , Richard , Duke of York , one of the Princes in the Tower , was only twelve years old ( and perhaps two years dead ) when the Battle of Bosworth Field took place in 1485 , and thus too young to have had two adult sons . One notable anachronism is Edmund ´ s title , Duke of Edinburgh , as Scotland was an independent kingdom ruled by a different royal house from its inception in the ninth century until 1603 ( with the exception of some periods during the turmoil of the Scottish Wars of Independence ) though given that this is an alternate history , it is possible that Henry Tudor falsified the history of Scotland as well .",

The visual similarity between the destruction of the World Trade Center and the felling of Home Tree in the film caused some filmgoers to further identify with the Na 'vi and to identify the human military contractors as terrorists . Critics asked whether this comparison was intended to encourage audiences to empathize with the position of Muslims under military occupation today .",

  "The rebellious Noldor , who followed their leader Fëanor to Middle @-@ earth , spoke only Quenya . But Elu Thingol , King of the Sindar of Beleriand , forbade the use of Quenya in his realm when he learned of the slaying of Telerin Elves by the Noldor ( The Silmarillion , chapter 15 ) . By doing so , he both restricted the possibility of the Sindar to enhance and brighten their language with influences from Quenya and accelerated the \" dimininuation and spiritual impoverishment \" of the Noldorin culture . The Noldor at this time had fully mastered Sindarin , while the Sindar were slow to learn Quenya . Quenya in Middle @-@ earth became known as Exilic Quenya when the Noldor eventually adopted the Sindarin language as their native speech after Thingol 's ruling . It differed from Amanian Quenya mostly in vocabulary , having some loanwords from Sindarin . It differed also in pronunciation , representing the recognition of sound @-@ changes which had begun among the Noldor before the exile and had caused Noldorin Quenya to diverge from Vanyarin Quenya . The change of z ( < old intervocalic s ) to r was the latest in Noldorin , belonging to early Exilic Quenya . The grammatical changes were only small though since the features of their \" old language \" were carefully taught .",

Following a short tour aboard HMS Crescent , Murray was assigned to HMS Aurora as Navigation Officer , until Aurora was paid off in 1921 due to naval budget cuts .

Understandably , this provided Murray and his peers , including Percy W. Nelles , with a distinct anglophile and , in matters military , Royal Navy bias . In January 1925 , Murray was promoted to Lieutenant @-@ Commander and spent two years at the Royal Canadian Navy 's main training base at HMCS Stadacona . In 1927 , Murray returned to the UK where he did a tour aboard HMS Tiger and then spent 1928 studying at the Royal Naval Staff College at Greenwich . During a simulation exercise at the College , Murray broke new ground by planning large convoys - convoys that were regarded at the time as \" almost suicidal \" , but which had become normal by the time of the Battle of the Atlantic . Upon return to Canada in January 1929 , Murray was promoted to Commander and became the senior naval officer at CFB Esquimalt . In notes for a lecture to RMC Kingston in 1932 , his continuing interest in the offensive merit of convoys over patrols is evident :",

Jones had hoped to relocate the Mississaugas of Credit here if they failed to obtain title deeds for New Credit , but this plan was opposed by Indian Agent Samuel Jarvis . At the Muncey Mission , each tribe spoke a different language , which made the work challenging for Jones , as did the large contingent of non @-@ Christian Indians . Here two more children were born to the couple , John Frederick ( Wahbegwuna ( Waabigwane , \" Have a [ White Lily- ] Flower \" ) ) and Peter Edmund ( Kahkewaquonaby ( Gakiiwegwanebi , \" [ Sacred ] Waving Feathers \" ) ) . John was named for Peter 's brother John and Eliza 's brother Frederick , Peter for Peter himself and Eliza 's brother Edmund . The work at Muncey Mission was stressful on Jones , and his health began to deteriorate . The 1844 Methodist conference found him in such ill health that he was declared a supernumerary . The same year , Jarvis was dismissed as chief superintendent of the Indian Agents . With Jarvis removed from office , Jones was able to secure an audience with lieutenant governor Charles Metcalfe . Metcalfe was favourably impressed with Jones ; he made available funds to build two schools at the Muncey Mission ( a boy 's school and a girl 's school ) and turned over administration of the Credit Mississaugas ' finances to their chiefs , making them the first Indian Band in Canada to have control over their trust funds .",

  "The local gravitational acceleration at the poles is greater than at the equator , so , by the Von Zeipel theorem , the local luminosity is also higher at the poles . This is seen as a variation in effective temperature over the star : the polar temperature is near 10 @,@ 000 K , while the equatorial temperature is 7 @,@ 600 K. As a result , if Vega were viewed along the plane of its equator , then the luminosity would be about half the apparent luminosity as viewed from the pole . This large temperature difference between the poles and the equator produces a strong ' gravity darkening ' effect . As viewed from the poles , this results in a darker ( lower intensity ) limb than would normally be expected for a spherically symmetric star . The temperature gradient may also mean Vega has a convection zone around the equator , while the remainder of the atmosphere is likely to be in almost pure radiative equilibrium .",

  "Conway described the panel as indicating \" an astonishing depth of psychological insight \" for an artist not yet 20 years old . In its simple design and detail it shares many of the characteristics of , and is a key precursor to , Dürer 's mature work . He portrayed his father again in 1497 , when the older man would have been around 70 . He has aged noticeably in the intervening seven years : his skin is saggier , the wrinkles deeper and more pronounced . In this later portrait Dürer seems at pains to convey these effects of ageing , which are all too evident on his father 's face . According to Brion , his eyes have lost their \" distant , mystic \" appearance and now seem less contented . Conway agrees , seeing traces of haggardly agitation , but holds that the two paintings convey a similar overall highly favourable and compassionate impression of the man .",

The first is that a military government is not one whit more able to save the country from the vicissitudes of war nor any braver or resourceful in meeting them than a civil government .

  "Macrolide antibiotics , such as erythromycin , are an effective treatment for DPB when taken regularly over an extended period of time . Clarithromycin or roxithromycin are also commonly used . The successful results of macrolides in DPB and similar lung diseases stems from managing certain symptoms through immunomodulation ( adjusting the immune response ) , which can be achieved by taking the antibiotics in low doses .

  "Consideration of throffers forms part of the wider question of coercion and , specifically , the possibility of a coercive offer . Determining whether throffers are coercive , and , if so , to what extent , is difficult . The traditional assumption is that offers cannot be coercive , only threats can , but throffers can challenge this . The threatening aspect of a throffer need not be explicit , as it was in Steiner 's examples . Instead , a throffer may take the form of an offer , but carry an implied threat . Philosopher John Kleinig sees a throffer as an example of an occasion when an offer alone may be considered coercive . Another example of a coercive offer may be when the situation in which the offer is made is already unacceptable ; for instance , if a factory owner takes advantage of a poor economic environment to offer workers an unfair wage . For Jonathan Riley , a liberal society has a duty to protect its citizens from coercion , whether that coercion comes from a threat , offer , throffer or some other source . \" If other persons ... attempt to frustrate the right @-@ holder 's wants , then a liberal society must take steps to prevent this , by law if necessary .

  "Reserve lever or \" J @-@ valve \" . Until the 1970s , when submersible pressure gauges on regulators came into common use , diving cylinders often used a mechanical reserve mechanism to indicate to the diver that the cylinder was nearly empty . The gas supply was automatically cut @-@ off by a spring loaded valve when the gas pressure reached the reserve pressure . To release the reserve , the diver pulled down on a rod that ran along the side of the cylinder and which activated a lever to open a bypass valve . The diver would then finish the dive before the reserve ( typically 300 pounds per square inch ( 21 bar ) ) was consumed . On occasion , divers would inadvertently trigger the mechanism while donning gear or performing a movement underwater and , not realizing that the reserve had already been accessed , could find themselves out of air at depth with no warning whatsoever .

  "After determining the ranges of motion in the joints of the forelimb , the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of Acrocanthosaurus . The forelimbs could not swing forward very far , unable even to scratch the animal 's own neck . Therefore , they were not likely to have been used in the initial capture of prey and Acrocanthosaurus probably led with its mouth when hunting . On the other hand , the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly . Once prey had been seized in the jaws , the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted , holding the prey tightly against the body and preventing escape . As the prey animal attempted to pull away , it would only have been further impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits . The extreme hyperextensibility of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing Acrocanthosaurus to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation . Once the prey was trapped against the body , Acrocanthosaurus may have dispatched it with its jaws . Another possibility is that Acrocanthosaurus held its prey in its jaws , while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs , tearing large gashes with its claws .",

In the aftermath of the initial Reformation settlement , Parliament passed the Witchcraft Act 1563 , similar to that passed in England one year earlier , which made witchcraft a capital crime . Despite the fact that Scotland probably had about one quarter of the population of England , it had three times the number of witchcraft prosecutions , at about 6 @,@ 000 for the entire period . James VI 's visit to Denmark , a country familiar with witch hunts , may have encouraged an interest in the study of witchcraft . After his return to Scotland , he attended the North Berwick witch trials , the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act . Several people , most notably Agnes Sampson , were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James ' ship . James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches and , inspired by his personal involvement , in 1597 wrote the Daemonologie , a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare 's Tragedy of Macbeth . James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches . After 1599 , his views became more sceptical .",
