Jon Pareles of The New York Times described it as \" inspirational \" , and felt that due to its vagueness , the song is would be applicable to all listeners , not just Carey . The Daily Union 's David Germain commented how the song 's simple musical arrangement and Carey 's \" restrained \" vocal delivery aided it in becoming \" modest and reserved \" . Writing for Billboard , Michael Paoletta chose \" Through the Rain \" as a top pick from the album , as did Allmusic 's Stephen Thomas Erlewine . He described it as a song that was designed as \" ' Vision of Love ' meets ' Hero ' \" , and wrote , \" Mariah is back in the adult contemporary camp , no longer trying to prove that she 's real . \" Cara DiPasquale from the Chicago Tribune called it a \" powerhouse ballad \" , while Entertainment Weekly 's Tom Sinclair wrote \" embellished with her trademark vocal pyrotechnics , it is one of those highly personal songs about finding your way out of an emotional wilderness , but it sinks in its own sodden sentimentality \" . Similarly , a writer from Newsday also described \" Through the Rain \" as a \" powerhouse ballad \" , and felt it was reminiscent of Carey 's previous single \" One Sweet Day \" ( 1995 ) . Writing for the Los Angeles Times , Randy Lewis noted how the song was able to effectively take listeners right into Carey 's personal struggles from the previous year . Tina Brown from Newsweek felt that while Carey 's personal troubles may not have been fully solved , the song made her appear \" strong and triumphant \" .",

  "The German population and troops generally disliked the idea of violating Dutch neutrality . The German propaganda therefore justified the invasion as a reaction to a supposed Entente attempt to occupy the Low Countries , similar to the justification used by the German Empire to invade Belgium in World War I. Some German officers had an aversion against the Nazi regime and were also uneasy about the invasion . One of them , Colonel Hans Oster , an Abwehr ( German military intelligence ) officer , began in March 1939 to pass along information to his friend , the Dutch military attaché in Berlin Major Gijsbertus J. Sas . This information included the attack date of Fall Gelb . Sas informed the Allies via other military attachés .

Assisted by rain that shortened the available playing time , England drew the match . Chapman scored 45 in his only innings . The fourth Test match was also badly affected by rain which brought about another draw . Chapman now faced further criticism of his captaincy .

  "The luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle . During the luteal phase , the pituitary hormones FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum , which produces progesterone . The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen . The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself . Consequently , the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time , and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies . Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle . From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin , the process typically takes about two weeks , with 14 days considered normal . For an individual woman , the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle ; by contrast , the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle .",

The Duke responded , denying any connection to the breed , although he did state that his grandfather , Henry Howard , 13th Duke of Norfolk , owned Sussex Spaniels . The letter from the Duke was printed in The Kennel Gazette in 1899 . An alternative origin was proposed by Rawdon Briggs Lee in volume two of his 1897 work A History and Description of the Modern Dogs of Great Britain and Ireland . Lee argued that the Norfolk Spaniel was descended from a crossing of a curly @-@ coated water spaniel and a Sussex Spaniel or another strain of land spaniel .",

  "During the settlement period the lands ruled by the incomers seem to have been fragmented into numerous tribal territories , but by the 7th century , when substantial evidence of the situation again becomes available , these had coalesced into roughly a dozen kingdoms including Northumbria , Mercia , Wessex , East Anglia , Essex , Kent and Sussex . Over the following centuries this process of political consolidation continued . The 7th century saw a struggle for hegemony between Northumbria and Mercia , which in the 8th century gave way to Mercian preeminence . In the early 9th century Mercia was displaced as the foremost kingdom by Wessex . Later in that century escalating attacks by the Danes culminated in the conquest of the north and east of England , overthrowing the kingdoms of Northumbria , Mercia and East Anglia . Wessex under Alfred the Great was left as the only surviving English kingdom , and under his successors it steadily expanded at the expense of the kingdoms of the Danelaw . This brought about the political unification of England , first accomplished under Æthelstan in 927 and definitively established after further conflicts by Eadred in 953 . A fresh wave of Scandinavian attacks from the late 10th century ended with the conquest of this united kingdom by Sweyn Forkbeard in 1013 and again by his son Cnut in 1016 , turning it into the centre of a short @-@ lived North Sea Empire that also included Denmark and Norway .

  "As a result of their warming effects when relatively thin , cirrus clouds have been implicated as a potential partial cause of global warming . Scientists have speculated that global warming could cause high thin cloud cover to increase , thereby increasing temperatures and humidity . This , in turn , would increase the cirrus cloud cover , effectively creating a positive feedback circuit . A prediction of this hypothesis is that the cirrus would move higher as the temperatures rose , increasing the volume of air underneath the clouds and the amount of infrared radiation reflected back down to earth . In addition , the hypothesis suggests that the increase in temperature would tend to increase the size of the ice crystals in the cirrus cloud , possibly causing the reflection of solar radiation and the reflection of the Earth 's infrared radiation to balance out .",

  "The music was composed by Nathan Furst , whose preferred composition style of grand orchestra and electronica was what the film 's producers were looking for . Initially ignorant of the Bionicle universe , he explored the official website after getting the job as composer to get better context for his music . This and discussions he had with staff helped in the creation of eight or nine specific themes . The overall style is grand orchestral , but includes elements of electronic and tribal music . Furst used elements of African , Polynesian , and Eastern European music to communicate the fact that Mata Nui was an island , and when he could he incorporated his music into the action rather than leaving it as a standalone element within scenes .",
  "Upon the withdrawal of Israeli forces , Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser issued several reforms in Gaza , including the expansion of educational opportunities and civil services , provision of housing and the establishment of local security forces .

  "President Seth S. Haines of Waynesville broke ground in Eden Park on September 1 , 1876 , although most early work was done outside Cincinnati . The company continued to be plagued by lack of funds , and , despite completion of the grade between Norwood and Waynesville within a year , work soon slowed and eventually stopped in late 1878 . Contractor John B. Benedict brought a suit in December for breach of contract , alleging that he was not properly paid . During the trial , two embarrassing facts came to light : Haines and Benedict had signed a \" secret contract \" giving Haines a portion of the bonds paid to Benedict , and the price of the line south of Norwood had been artificially inflated so that the connecting Cincinnati and Eastern Railway ( C & E , later a N & W line ) would have to pay more for trackage rights into Cincinnati . However , it was nonpayment of interest on bonds that forced the Miami Valley into receivership in January and foreclosure in March 1880 .

  "Flight 261 , an McDonnell Douglas MD @-@ 83 , plunged into the Pacific Ocean near Point Mugu , California while preparing to attempt an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport en route from Puerto Vallarta , Mexico , to San Francisco and Seattle , killing all 88 people on board . In its final report , the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) determined the cause of the accident to be failure of acme nut threads which were part of the jackscrew assembly for the horizontal stabilizer 's trim system . The failure of the acme nut threads happened because of insufficient lubrication of the jackscrew assembly which was the result of Alaska 's extended lubrication and inspection intervals and from the Federal Aviation Administration 's ( FAA ) approval of those intervals . NTSB also found that the lack of a fail @-@ safe mechanism for the failure of the acme nut threads on the MD @-@ 80 design contributed to the accident .

  "After Cosimo 's triumphant return to Florence , rather than scrapping the project , in May 1436 the Medici regime hired Uccello to replace the Gaddi and Pesello fresco . Hugh Hudson suggests that it would have been too risky for the Medici to cancel the Albizzi project , so they instead shrewdly modified it to fit their interests . There is , of course , some weakness to attributing the commissioning and re @-@ commissioning of the monument to Albizzi or Medici intrigues , as only two ( maybe three ) of the eight operai on July 13 , 1433 were members of the Albizzi faction and only one was a Medici when it was resumed on May 18 , 1436 ; yet the influences of both factions doubtlessly did not require blood relation . Around this time , documents attest to multiple repairs of a nearby window , opening the possibility that the original fresco had experienced water damage , and would have needed to be restored in any case . Others have suggested that the recommissioning was part of the \" refurbishing \" of the cathedral associated with its rededication as Santa Maria del Fiore by Pope Eugene IV in March 1436 .

  "Another important factor was the development in the late 18th and early 19th centuries of museums with large natural history collections . These museums received specimens from collectors around the world and served as centers for the study of comparative anatomy and morphology .

One of the first and most important examples was the Museum of Natural History in Paris , which was at the center of many of the developments in natural history during the first decades of the 19th century .

Although the Austro @-@ Hungarians were right in assuming that the Serbian Army was exhausted , its defensive positions along the Kolubara had been prepared months in advance . Putnik 's carefully timed withdrawals had ensured that the losses of the Serbian Army were lighter than if it had stood and fought pitched battles with the Austro @-@ Hungarians .

  "Wanyan Liang was crowned Jin emperor in 1150 after killing his cousin and predecessor , Emperor Xizong , in a palace coup . Wanyan Liang considered himself more of a Chinese authoritarian ruler than a Jurchen leader who ruled through a tribal council . The History of Jin contends that Wanyan Liang told his officials that the three desires of his life were conquest , absolute power , and women . His ultimate ambition was to rule over all of China , not just the north . In his childhood , Wanyan Liang adopted Song practices like drinking tea by learning from Song emissaries , and once he had become emperor , he pursued a policy of sinicizing the state . His affinity for the culture of the Song earned him the Jurchen nickname of \" aping the Chinese \" . He moved the Supreme Capital of the Jin from Huining in Manchuria to Beijing and promoted Kaifeng to his Southern Capital in 1157 . He also moved government institutions south , tore down palaces of Jurchen chieftains in Manchuria , and constructed new palaces in Beijing and Kaifeng . He made plans to move the Jin capital further south to the center of China . Wanyan Liang 's construction projects drained the Jin treasury .",

The NHA had given the Wanderers the rights to Taylor in a dispersal of the Renfrew players . Trade talks were unfruitful .

  "There had been an overwhelming Conservative @-@ Unionist majority in the Lords since the Liberal split in 1886 . With the Liberal Party attempting to push through significant welfare reforms with considerable popular support , this seemed certain to cause problems in the relationship between the Houses . Between 1906 and 1909 , several important measures were being considerably watered down or rejected outright : for example , Birrell introduced the Education Bill 1906 , which was intended to address nonconformist grievances arising from the Education Act 1902 , but which was amended by the Lords to such an extent that it was effectively a different bill , upon which the Commons dropped the bill . This led to the 26 June 1907 resolution in the House of Commons declaring that the Lords ' power should be curtailed , put forward by Liberal Prime Minister Henry Campbell @-@ Bannerman . In 1909 , hoping to force an election , the Lords rejected the financial bill based on the government budget ( the \" People 's Budget \" ) put forward by David Lloyd George , by 350 votes to 75 . This , according to the Commons , was \" a breach of the Constitution , and a usurpation of the rights of the Commons \" . The Lords suggested that the Commons justify its position as representing the will of the people : it did this through the January 1910 general election . The Liberal government lost heavily , but remained in majority with the help of a significant number of Irish Nationalist and Labour MPs . The Irish Nationalists saw the continued power of the Lords as detrimental to securing Irish Home Rule . Following the election , the Lords relented on the budget ( since reintroduced by the government ) , it passing the Lords on 28 April , a day after the Commons .",

  "As the number of players required to defeat a boss grows , so does the problem of distributing the rewards from such efforts . Since these items appear , or \" drop \" , in quantities much smaller than the total number of players in the group required to defeat them , a means of deciding which of the players should receive the items is necessary . At the \" endgame \" , new items rewarded from boss kills represent one of the only means to continue to enhance the combat effectiveness of the character or the social standing of the player . As such , individual players care about receiving a fair shot at dropped items . Guilds facing smaller challenges with fewer players typically begin by allotting items through a simulated roll of the dice ( provided by the software serving the game itself ) , similar to dice rolls used to dictate the outcome of contingent events in pen and paper role @-@ playing games . As the number of players expands , rolls may be weighted by seniority within the guild or adjusted by some other measure so as to ensure that veterans of the guild do not lose out on an item to a new member .

Methods to reward items according to seniority or performance developed out of these modifications , including systems relying on a formal allotment of points per kill .",

  "In 1972 , the NHL faced competition from the newly formed World Hockey Association ( WHA ) . The WHA lured many players away from the NHL . The WHA 's biggest coup was to lure Bobby Hull from the Black Hawks to play for the Winnipeg Jets . He signed a $ 2 @.@ 75 million contract , and lent instant credibility to the new league . After Hull signed , several other players quickly followed suit and the NHL suddenly found itself in a war for talent . By the time the 1972 – 73 WHA season began , 67 players had switched from the NHL to the WHA . The NHL also found itself competing with the WHA for markets . Initially , the league had no intention to expand past 14 teams , but the threat the WHA represented caused the league to change its plans . The league hastily announced the creation of the New York Islanders and Atlanta Flames as 1972 expansion teams . Following the 1972 – 73 season , the NHL announced it was further expanding to 18 @-@ teams for the 1974 – 75 season , adding the Kansas City Scouts and Washington Capitals .

  "It is difficult to teach delayed gratification when children grow up expecting a large , instant reward for their years of schooling . Societal impacts and current media trends have had the effect of teaching people to expect instant gratification . The idea of waiting for a good job , earned through working from the bottom up , frequently upsets and frustrates emerging adults in today 's society . This desire for immediate gratification is not only found in workplaces , but also in interpersonal relationships . Current studies show that 45 % of marriages will end in divorce . Without the ability to delay gratification people are more apt to end relationships rather than work on them .

  "Perforator veins play a very special role in the venous system , carrying blood from superficial to deep veins . During the muscular systole their valves close and stop any blood flow coming from the deep to the superficial veins . When their valves become insufficient , they are responsible for a rapid deterioration in existing varicose disease and for the development of venous ulcers . Detection of insufficient perforators is important because they need to be ligatured . However , the detection of competent ones is as important because they may be used strategically in new techniques of conservative surgery , for example a minimally invasive CHIVA .

  "A relatively advanced theory of interest is also presented . Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders , meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for the risk of the possible insolvency of the debtor . In turn , interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital . While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money , Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market — an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume . As such , while saved money impacts the rate of interest , new money that is instead used for consumption does not ; Cantillon 's theory of interest is therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes 's liquidity preference theory .",
  "Watterson 's technique started with minimalist pencil sketches drawn with a light pencil ( though the larger Sunday strips often required more elaborate work ) on a piece of Bristol board , with his brand of choice being Strathmore because he felt it held the drawings better on the page as opposed to the cheaper brands ( Watterson said he would use any cheap pad of Bristol board his local supply store had , but switched to Strathmore after he found himself growing more and more displeased with the results ) . He would then use a small sable brush and India ink to fill in the rest of the drawing , saying that he did not want to simply trace over his penciling and thus make the inking more spontaneous . He lettered dialogue with a Rapidograph fountain pen , and he used a crowquill pen for odds and ends . Mistakes were covered with various forms of correction fluid , including the type used on typewriters . Watterson was careful in his use of color , often spending a great deal of time in choosing the right colors to employ for the weekly Sunday strip ; his technique was to cut the color tabs the syndicate sent him into individual squares , lay out the colors , and then paint a watercolor approximation of the strip on tracing paper over the Bristol board and then mark the strip accordingly before sending it on . When Calvin and Hobbes began there were 64 colors available for the Sunday strips . For the later Sunday strips Watterson had 125 colors as well as the ability to fade the colors into each other .",

  "Second @-@ impact syndrome , in which the brain swells dangerously after a minor blow , may occur in very rare cases . The condition may develop in people who receive a second blow days or weeks after an initial concussion , before its symptoms have gone away . No one is certain of the cause of this often fatal complication , but it is commonly thought that the swelling occurs because the brain 's arterioles lose the ability to regulate their diameter , causing a loss of control over cerebral blood flow . As the brain swells , intracranial pressure rapidly rises . The brain can herniate , and the brain stem can fail within five minutes . Except in boxing , all cases have occurred in athletes under age 20 . Due to the very small number of documented cases , the diagnosis is controversial , and doubt exists about its validity . A 2010 Pediatrics review article stated that there is debate whether the brain swelling is due to two separate hits or to just one hit , but in either case , catastrophic football head injuries are three times more likely in high school athletes than in college athletes .",

Amid a sea of complaints about church governance , he and Fiennes in February 1641 were added to a committee that had been established the previous November to draft a report on the state of the kingdom . Their efforts led Vane to introduce the Root and Branch Bill in May 1641 . The debate on the bill was acrimonious , and resulted in a clear indication of parliamentary support for church reform . In its wake mobs invaded churches , removing \" scandalous images \" and other signs of \" popery \" . Vane made an impassioned speech that brought him to the front of his faction , claiming episcopacy ( the governing structure of the Church of England ) was a corrupt doctrine \" hastening us back again to Rome . \" The bill died without a vote in August , when more critical matters arose to occupy Parliament . When Charles went to Scotland to rally Scottish forces to the royalist cause , the Commons began drafting what became known as the Grand Remonstrance . Many historians have claimed Vane had a role in drafting some of its language ; this matter is disputed , but either way Vane did not participate in the debate .

  "Later in 1939 , Prokofiev composed his Piano Sonatas Nos. 6 , 7 , and 8 , Opp . 82 – 84 , widely known today as the \" War Sonatas . \" Premiered respectively by Prokofiev ( No. 6 : 8 April 1940 ) , Sviatoslav Richter ( No. 7 : Moscow , 18 January 1943 ) and Emil Gilels ( No. 8 : Moscow , 30 December 1944 ) , they were subsequently championed in particular by Richter . Biographer Daniel Jaffé argued that Prokofiev , \" having forced himself to compose a cheerful evocation of the nirvana Stalin wanted everyone to believe he had created \" ( i.e. in Zdravitsa ) then subsequently , in these three sonatas , \" expressed his true feelings \" .

Nightingales ... sing their song of longing from their dungeon 's depth ... everyone delights , yet no one feels the pain , the deep sorrow in the song . \" Ironically ( because , it appears , no one had noticed his allusion ) Sonata No. 7 received a Stalin Prize ( Second Class ) , and No. 8 a Stalin Prize First Class .",

  "Mass loss is one of the most intensively studied aspects of massive star research . Put simply , using observed mass loss rates in the best models of stellar evolution do not reproduce the observed distribution of evolved massive stars such as Wolf – Rayets , the number and types of core collapse supernovae , or their progenitors . To match those observations , the models require much higher mass loss rates . Eta Carinae A has one of the highest known mass loss rates , currently around 10 − 3 M ☉ / year , and is an obvious candidate for study .",

  "Smallpox is highly contagious , but generally spreads more slowly and less widely than some other viral diseases , perhaps because transmission requires close contact and occurs after the onset of the rash . The overall rate of infection is also affected by the short duration of the infectious stage . In temperate areas , the number of smallpox infections were highest during the winter and spring . In tropical areas , seasonal variation was less evident and the disease was present throughout the year . Age distribution of smallpox infections depends on acquired immunity . Vaccination immunity declines over time and is probably lost within thirty years . Smallpox is not known to be transmitted by insects or animals and there is no asymptomatic carrier state .",

  "In the eighteenth century there was a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility .

  "Individuals under the current system who accumulated savings from ordinary income ( by choosing not to spend their money when the income was earned ) paid taxes on that income before it was placed in savings ( such as a Roth IRA or CD ) . When individuals spend above the poverty level with money saved under the current system , that spending would be subject to the FairTax .

Critics have stated that the FairTax would result in unfair double taxation for savers and suggest it does not address the transition effect on some taxpayers who have accumulated significant savings from after @-@ tax dollars , especially retirees who have finished their careers and switched to spending down their life savings . Supporters of the plan argue that the current system is no different , since compliance costs and \" hidden taxes \" embedded in the prices of goods and services cause savings to be \" taxed \" a second time already when spent . The rebate would supplement accrued savings , covering taxes up to the poverty level . The income taxes on capital gains , estates , social security and pension benefits would be eliminated under FairTax . In addition , the FairTax legislation adjusts Social Security benefits for changes in the price level , so a percentage increase in prices would result in an equal percentage increase to Social Security income .

Many reviewers also noted that the puzzles , though a staple of the day when Grim Fandango was first released , remain somewhat obtuse with solutions that are not clear even after the player solves them , and that a hint system , as was added to the Monkey Island remake , would have been very helpful . The game 's pacing , also unchanged from the original version , was also found harder to grasp considering the direction taken in modern games , in both the pacing within the game 's four acts , and the time taken to move around and between rooms .

  "Many astrologers claim that astrology is scientific . If one were to attempt to try to explain it scientifically , there are only four fundamental forces ( conventionally ) , limiting the choice of possible natural mechanisms . Some astrologers have proposed conventional causal agents such as electromagnetism and gravity . The strength of these forces drops off with distance . Scientists reject these proposed mechanisms as implausible since , for example , the magnetic field , when measured from earth , of a large but distant planet such as Jupiter is far smaller than that produced by ordinary household appliances . Astronomer Phil Plait noted that in terms of magnitude , the sun is the only object with an electromagnetic field of note , but astrology isn 't based just off the sun alone . While astrologers could try to suggest a fifth force , this is inconsistent with the trends in physics with the unification of Electromagnetism and the weak force into the electroweak force . If the astrologer insisted on being inconsistent with the current understanding and evidential basis of physics , that would be an extraordinary claim . It would also be inconsistent with the other forces which drop off with distance . If distance is irrelevant , then , logically , all objects in space should be taken into account .",

  "Perhaps Clement 's most significant activities were , however , in relation to the bishopric of Argyll . In 1241 , Argyll 's last bishop , William , had been drowned while at sea . Argyll was the poorest bishopric in Scotland , and the area lacked strong royal authority , and hence good royal protection . In the following six years , no one had taken up the vacant bishopric . From at least 1247 , then , Clement was given charge of the diocese . He was essentially being asked to do for Argyll what he had previously done for Strathearn . The sources are quite thin on this ground , but by 1249 he had brought at least one more church into the control of the bishopric . On 23 December 1248 , he was also authorised by the Pope to appoint , with the agreement of the Bishop of Glasgow , a new bishop for Argyll . In January 1249 , Clement was given permission to move the cathedral of Argyll , based on Lismore , to the mainland . Clement 's problem seems to have been with the ruler of Argyll , Eóghan . The lack of royal authority in Argyll made it difficult for the national and international church to exercise control in the province ; at the same time , establishing a strong bishopric in the area was vital to integrating the area fully into the kingdom , an aim cherished by the contemporary king , Alexander II . Thus Alexander 's goal and Clement 's goal were essentially one and the same . It is impossible to be more specific , but in 1249 , King Alexander II launched an expedition against Eóghan . The king was attempting to force Eóghan , whose lands lay within both the overlordship of the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of Norway , to renounce his allegiance to the King of Norway . Eóghan told Alexander that he was unable to do this . The contemporary historian Matthew Paris wrote that :",

  "The Minister Herald ( Dahonglu 大鴻臚 ) was also known as the Grand Herald ; he was also called the Director of Guests ( Dianke 典客 ) between 202 BC and 144 BC and Prefect Grand Usher ( Daxingling 大行令 ) between 144 BC and 104 BC . He was the chief official in charge of receiving honored guests , such as nobles and foreign ambassadors , at the imperial court . Alongside the Minister of the Imperial Clan , his ministry oversaw the inheritance of titles and fiefs by condoling on behalf of the emperor at kings ' funerals and memorializing the posthumous names of kings and marquises . The Minister Herald 's office received the annual reports from the commanderies and kingdoms when they arrived in the capital at the beginning of the year , before passing them on to the Excellencies . His subordinates acted as seating guides and ushers for officials , nobles , and foreign delegates at imperial ceremonies and sacrifices . One of his subordinates maintained living quarters for officials in the commanderies and kingdoms who were traveling to the capital . While the Minister Herald had always conducted the formal reception of foreign envoys and enlisted the aid of interpreters , his powers in matters of foreign affairs were expanded further when the post of Director of Dependent States was abolished in 28 BC . However , by Eastern Han his duties involving the affairs of Dependent States were transferred to local administrations along the borders .",
  "In some serpins , the S to R transition can activate cell signalling events . In these cases , a serpin that has formed a complex with its target protease , is then recognised by a receptor . The binding event then leads to downstream signalling by the receptor . The S to R transition is therefore used to alert cells to the presence of protease activity . This differs from the usual mechanism whereby serpins affect signalling simply by inhibiting proteases involved in a signalling cascade .",

Because most of the Daytime Arietids are not visible to the naked eye , they are observed in the radio spectrum . This is possible because of the ionized gas they leave in their wake . Other meteor showers radiate from Aries during the day ; these include the Daytime Epsilon Arietids and the Northern and Southern Daytime May Arietids . The Jodrell Bank Observatory discovered the Daytime Arietids in 1947 when James Hey and G. S. Stewart adapted the World War II @-@ era radar systems for meteor observations .",

  "The column typical of the genus Stylidium is sensitive and responds to touch . The change in pressure when a pollinating insect lands on a Stylidium flower causes a physiological change in the column turgor pressure by way of an action potential , sending the column quickly flying toward the insect . Upon impact , the insect will be covered in pollen and stunned , but not harmed . Because the column comprises the fused male and female reproductive organs of the flower , the stamen and stigma take turns in dominating the function of the column — the anthers develop first and then are pushed aside by the developing stigma .

  "As they evolved from lunged fish , amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land , including the need to develop new means of locomotion . In the water , the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward , but on land , quite different mechanisms were required . Their vertebral columns , limbs , limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding . Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air . They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature . They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment . Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water . The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss .",

  "Species boundaries in plants may be weaker than in animals , and cross species hybrids are often possible . A familiar example is peppermint , Mentha × piperita , a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint , Mentha spicata . The many cultivated varieties of wheat are the result of multiple inter- and intra @-@ specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids . Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self @-@ incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes . This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing . In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals . These species are said to be dioecious when referring to vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous when referring to bryophyte gametophytes .",

  "Very little is known about the Mascarene parrot in life . Since several specimens were kept alive in captivity , it was probably not a specialised feeder . That the Vienna specimen was partially white may have been the result of food deficiency during a long period in captivity ; the clipped primary wing feathers indicate it was caged . Little was known about parrot @-@ diet in the 1700s , and the Vienna specimen may not have received enough of the amino acid tyrosine through its food , which it would have needed for melanin synthesis . In other parrots , this would have resulted in orange instead of white colour in the affected feathers , due to the presence of the pigment psittacin , but Coracopsis parrots and the Mascarene parrot are the only parrots that lack this pigment .

The story can be read as an allegory , a warning that a human soul can be overtaken by the evil it has created , though Poe himself doesn 't suggest such a moral .

  "Much has been made of the fragmented editing of Don 't Look Now , and Nicolas Roeg 's work in general . Time is presented as ' fluid ' , where the past , present and future can all exist in the same timeframe . John 's premonitions merge with the present , such as at the start of the film where the mysterious red @-@ coated figure is seemingly depicted in one of his photographic slides , and when he ' sees ' Laura on the funeral barge with the sisters and mistakenly believes he is seeing the present , but in fact it is a vision of the future . The most famous use of this fragmented approach to time is during the love scene , in which the scenes of John and Laura having sex are intercut with scenes of them dressing afterwards to go out to dinner . After John is attacked by his assailant in the climactic moments , the preceding events depicted during the course of the film are recalled through flashback , which may be perceived as his life flashing before his eyes . At a narrative level the plot of Don 't Look Now can be regarded as a self @-@ fulfilling prophecy : it is John 's premonitions of his death that set in motion the events leading up to his death . According to the editor of the film , Graeme Clifford , Nicolas Roeg regarded the film as his \" exercise in film grammar \" .",

Although the surface is typically brown or darker , it may appear green due to epiphytic associations with algae such as Coccomyxa or Charicium species . Bryophytes or sometimes vascular plants grow on the upper surface of the conk . The texture of the fruit body is fibrous ; it is rubbery and tough when fresh , but becomes hard and brittle when it is dry .

  "Shylock is a good hater ; \" a man no less sinned against than sinning . \" If he carries his revenge too far , yet he has strong grounds for \" the lodged hate he bears Anthonio \" , which he explains with equal force of eloquence and reason . He seems the depositary of the vengeance of his race ; and though the long habit of brooding over daily insults and injuries has crusted over his temper with inveterate misanthropy , and hardened him against the contempt of mankind , this adds but little to the triumphant pretensions of his enemies . There is a strong , quick , and deep sense of justice mixed up with the gall and bitterness of his resentment . [ ... ] The desire of revenge is almost inseparable from the sense of wrong ; and we can hardly help sympathising with the proud spirit , hid beneath his \" Jewish gaberdine \" , stung to madness by repeated undeserved provocations , and labouring to throw off the load of obloquy and oppression heaped upon him and all his tribe by one desperate act of \" lawful \" revenge , till the ferociousness of the means by which he is to execute his purpose , and the pertinacity with which he adheres to it , turn us against him ; but even at last , when disappointed of the sanguinary revenge with which he had glutted his hopes , and exposed to beggary and contempt by the letter of the law on which he had insisted with so little remorse , we pity him , and think him hardly dealt with by his judges .",

  "Arguably the best light anti @-@ aircraft gun of the Second World War , the 40 mm Bofors was used for air defense both on land and at sea by many of the countries involved , including the Americans , British , Dutch , Japanese , and Swedish .

  "The victory of the Scots over the English at the Battle of Otterburn in Northumberland in August 1388 set in motion Carrick 's fall from power . One of the Scottish casualties was Carrick 's close ally James , Earl of Douglas . Douglas died without an heir , which led to various claims upon the title and estate — Carrick backed Malcolm Drummond , the husband of Douglas 's sister , while Fife sided with the successful appellant , Sir Archibald Douglas , lord of Galloway who possessed an entail on the Douglas estates . Fife , now with his powerful Douglas ally , and those who supported the king ensured a countercoup at the December Council meeting when the guardianship of Scotland passed from Carrick ( who had recently been badly injured from a horse @-@ kick ) to Fife .

  "The eggs hatch after about three weeks and the young are attended by both parents . Males are present around the nest for most of the day , and females most of the night . The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening . Most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties . Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6 a.m. Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching , with anywhere from 37 to 83 % of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades .

Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions , it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either perceived by the parents to have a higher chance of survival , or , being generally larger , the male nestlings simply out @-@ compete the small females for food .",

  "Historian Nicholas Rodger called Edward III 's claim to be the \" Sovereign of the Seas \" into question , arguing there was hardly any Royal Navy before the reign of Henry V ( 1413 – 22 ) . Although Rodger may have made this claim , the reality was that King John had already developed a royal fleet of galleys and had attempted to establish an administration for these ships and ones which were arrested ( privately owned ships pulled into royal / national service ) . Henry III , his successor , continued this work . Notwithstanding the fact that he , along with his predecessor , had hoped to develop a strong and efficient naval administration , their endeavours produced one that was informal and mostly ad hoc . A formal naval administration emerged during Edward 's reign which was composed of lay administrators and headed by William de Clewre , Matthew de Torksey , and John de Haytfield successively with them being titled , Clerk of the King 's Ships . Sir Robert de Crull was the last to fill this position during Edward III 's reign and would have the longest tenure in this position .

On his arrival he had assessed the existing defences in the region and had immediately begun the process of improving them , particularly those situated inland as he believed no more than thirty percent of the German defences were adequate . These anti @-@ airborne measures consisted of planting a large number of mines to create minefields as well as the erection of so @-@ called \" Rommel 's asparagus \" , a system of wire @-@ braced poles up to two metres in height , a great many of which were laced with mines or other booby @-@ traps aimed at destroying gliders and killing or wounding airborne troops . Rommel noted in his diary during an inspection of one area that a division had placed over 300 @,@ 000 stakes in the ground to deter airborne landings , and a corps had erected over 900 @,@ 000 . The Merville artillery battery , the destruction of which was one of the main objectives of the 6th Airborne Division , was a particularly heavily fortified position . From the beach it was protected by two strongpoints , which included approximately thirty bunkers as well as an observation post , and the battery itself consisted of a bunker containing the battery 's command post , two blockhouses , a light flak emplacement and four casemates able to contain artillery pieces up to dimensions of 150 mm . The entire battery covered an area roughly four hundred metres in diameter and was surrounded by an inner perimeter of barbed wire , a minefield , and an outer perimeter of barbed wire as well as an anti @-@ tank ditch .",

Eight extra King Arthur @-@ type boilers were ordered from North British and fitted to N15s Nos. 737 – 742 by December 1925 in an effort to improve steaming .

  "During the early 1970s , Valiente became a member of a far right white nationalist political party , the National Front , for about eighteen months , during which she designed a banner for her local branch . Valiente 's biographer Philip Heselton suggested that the party 's nationalistic outlook may have appealed to her strongly patriotic values and that she might have hoped that the Front would serve as a political equivalent to the Pagan movement . At the same time she also became a member of another , more extreme far right group , the Northern League . However , she allowed her membership of the National Front to lapse , sending a letter to her local branch stating that although she respected its leader John Tyndall and had made friends within the group , she was critical of the party 's opposition to women 's liberation , gay rights , and sex education , all of which she lauded as progressive causes . Heselton has also suggested that Valiente may have joined these groups in order to investigate them before reporting back to Britain 's intelligence agencies .",
  "The plan of the rooms at Belton was passé for a grand house of its time . Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas , it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room , dressing room , and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall . These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest , such as a visiting monarch . While Belton does have a saloon at its centre , enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it . The possible reason for this unusual layout is that , while the Brownlows possessed great wealth , their title was only a baronetcy , and their fortune was barely a century old . They would have been regarded as gentry , not aristocracy . As a result , building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest . However , the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows ' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695 . The King occupied the \" Best bedchamber \" , a large room with an adjoining closet , directly above the saloon , that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber .",

  "Gravitational interactions of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram . The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the Universe . This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies ( such as the Andromeda Galaxy ) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter , and redshift maps of clusters showing a Fingers of God effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution . This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio ( the ratio of a galaxy 's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities ) , an important tool for measuring dark matter .",

Of the six tropical cyclones , two only attained hurricane status . In addition , none of the tropical cyclones became a major hurricane , which is Category 3 or greater on Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . Although it is an oddity for no major hurricanes to occur during a season since the satellite era began , nearly all hurricane seasons during this time period lacked a major hurricane . However , it is likely that other tropical cyclones in the Eastern Pacific basin in 1949 went operationally unnoticed , due to lack of modern technology such as satellite imagery . In addition to the six tropical cyclones , another tropical cyclone developed in the Eastern Pacific basin , but was included in the Atlantic basin hurricane database , rather than the Eastern Pacific .

  "One theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in Florence caused by the Black Death , which hit Europe between 1348 and 1350 , resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th @-@ century Italy .

However , this does not fully explain why the Renaissance occurred specifically in Italy in the 14th century .

  "The advent of mechanization threatened all French draft breeds , and while many draft breeders turned their production towards the meat market , Norman Cob breeders instead crossed their horses with Thoroughbreds to contribute to the fledgling Selle Francais breed , now France 's national saddle horse . This allowed the Norman Cob to remain relatively the same through the decades , while other draft breeds were growing heavier and slower due to selection for meat . Between the 1970s and 1990s , the studbook went through several changes , and in the 1980s , genetic studies were performed that showed the breed suffered from inbreeding and genetic drift .

  "According to Nomura , \" death should be something sudden and unexpected , and Aerith 's death seemed more natural and realistic . \" He said : \" When I reflect on Final Fantasy VII , the fact that fans were so offended by her sudden death probably means that we were successful with her character . If fans had simply accepted her death , that would have meant she wasn 't an effective character . \" From the original release of the game , rumors have circulated that Aerith can be resurrected in or that the original plan was to have her come back , but this was scrapped in development . Nomura has categorically stated that neither of these rumors were ever true ; \" the world was expecting us to bring her back to life , as this is the classic convention . \" A lengthy petition asking for Aerith 's revival by Japanese players was sent to Kitase , but he dismissed it , pointing out that \" there are many meanings in Aerith 's death and [ her revival ] could never happen . \"",
  "Despite the magnanimous provisions of Rhode Island 's charter , it did not definitively settle the land disputes with Connecticut , which would continue for more than half a century . Nor did it settle the issue with the Atherton Company , occupying two large tracts of land within Rhode Island 's \" Narragansett country \" . Fortuitous for the Rhode Island colony , however , was the arrival in 1664 of a group of royal commissioners . Samuel Gorton had told the crown that in 1644 the Narragansett people had submitted themselves to England 's king . Once the newly arrived commissioners verified this , they declared all of the Narragansett territory ( what is now Washington County and a part of Kent County , Rhode Island , including the Atherton tracts ) , to be Kings Province . One of the commissioners was Samuel Maverick , a good friend of Rhode Island 's recent governor William Brenton , who abhorred the Atherton Company . Clarke was one of three men allowed to present Rhode Island 's views on the land disputes , and the commissioners ultimately took a strong stance in favor of Rhode Island . Eventually , the Atherton Company lost its Narragansett property , and the Kings Province became a part of the Rhode Island colony .",
  "Female noisy miners are aggressive towards each other , and one cause of a male @-@ biased sex @-@ ratio in colonies may be the females ' greater intolerance for each other , driving immatures out of the colony and preventing the immigration of new females . Aggression at the nest is common between males . Adult males begin attacking juveniles when they are around 11 weeks old , and attackers can include males that previously cared for the fledgling . Adult females are less aggressive towards young birds , although mothers do occasionally attack their own offspring , and infanticide has been recorded . There is little male to female aggression other than the ' driving flights ' that form part of the mating ritual . In direct attacks of young birds pecks are directed at the eye patch . Agonistic behaviour has been observed among nestlings , with aggression intensifying after fledging and at times resulting in the death of a sibling .",
  "Nitrogen is by far the most common impurity found in gem diamonds and is responsible for the yellow and brown color in diamonds . Boron is responsible for the blue color . Color in diamond has two additional sources : irradiation ( usually by alpha particles ) , that causes the color in green diamonds ; and plastic deformation of the diamond crystal lattice . Plastic deformation is the cause of color in some brown and perhaps pink and red diamonds . In order of rarity , yellow diamond is followed by brown , colorless , then by blue , green , black , pink , orange , purple , and red . \" Black \" , or Carbonado , diamonds are not truly black , but rather contain numerous dark inclusions that give the gems their dark appearance . Colored diamonds contain impurities or structural defects that cause the coloration , while pure or nearly pure diamonds are transparent and colorless . Most diamond impurities replace a carbon atom in the crystal lattice , known as a carbon flaw . The most common impurity , nitrogen , causes a slight to intense yellow coloration depending upon the type and concentration of nitrogen present . The Gemological Institute of America ( GIA ) classifies low saturation yellow and brown diamonds as diamonds in the normal color range , and applies a grading scale from \" D \" ( colorless ) to \" Z \" ( light yellow ) . Diamonds of a different color , such as blue , are called fancy colored diamonds , and fall under a different grading scale .",
  "The observation of a total solar eclipse of May 29 , 1919 helped to confirm Einstein 's theory of general relativity . By comparing the apparent distance between stars in the constellation Taurus , with and without the Sun between them , Arthur Eddington stated that the theoretical predictions about gravitational lenses were confirmed . The observation with the Sun between the stars was only possible during totality , since the stars are then visible . Though Eddington 's observations were near the experimental limits of accuracy at the time , work in the later half of the 20th century confirmed his results .",

  "In September , the most serious problem turned out to be a 30 @-@ day transit strike . By the end of July , estimates predicted that Expo would exceed 60 million visitors , but the strike cut deeply into attendance and revenue figures , just as the fair was cruising to its conclusion . Another major problem , beyond the control of Expo 's management , was guest accommodation and lodging . Logexpo was created to direct visitors to accommodations in the Montreal area , which usually meant that visitors would stay at the homes of people they were unfamiliar with , rather than traditional hotels or motels . The Montreal populace opened their homes to thousands of guests . Unfortunately for some visitors , they were sometimes sent to less than respectable establishments where operators took full advantage of the tourist trade . Management of Logexpo was refused to Expo and was managed by a Quebec provincial authority . Still , Expo would get most of the blame for directing visitors to these establishments .

  "Commenting on David Elliott 's resolution to diversify the range of camera angles , Stephen La Rivière , author of Filmed in Supermarionation : A History of the Future , expresses disappointment that the first half of \" 30 Minutes After Noon \" presents standard camera work : he judges these scenes to be \" filmed as normal \" , and suggests that they compare negatively to the \" quirky visuals \" of the latter half . La Rivière also discusses the episode 's editing , noting that \" 30 Minutes After Noon \" is split into two distinct storylines ( with the exploits of Southern and the British Secret Service only coming after the devastation of the Hudson Building ) .

  "One of the first decisions Hsu had to make was how to localize Maya 's hometown and the mysticism of the Fey clan . She came up with the idea that the localized versions of the Ace Attorney games take place in Los Angeles in an alternative universe where anti @-@ Japanese laws like the California Alien Land Law of 1913 were not passed , anti @-@ Japanese sentiments were not powerful , and where Japanese culture flourished . This dictated what should be localized and what should be kept Japanese ; things relating to the Fey clan and the Kurain channeling technique were kept Japanese , as that was Maya 's heritage , while Japanese foods that were not widely known in the West were changed . Despite the setting in the United States in the localized version , the Japanese justice system of the original remained intact in the localization , as changing it would have altered the entire game structure . As the localization team wanted to keep the humor in the Japanese names for the characters , it was decided to make the English names contain the same kinds of double meanings : character name puns were based on their personalities or backgrounds , or were visual gags . A lot of the names were determined with the original Japanese name in mind ; for the game 's third episode , several Japanese names were used without changes , since they were English puns to begin with . For some other characters , the names had to be altered heavily from the Japanese originals . Due to the dramatic feeling of the last episode , the characters in it were given names that sounded more like real names , while still making use of deeper meanings . Takumi personally approved all the English names ; for one of the names , Takumi and the localization team had a discussion for days , as Takumi did not think the English name conveyed the same feeling as the Japanese one .",

  "Like all hammerhead sharks , the smalleye hammerhead is viviparous : when the developing embryos exhaust their supply of yolk , the depleted yolk sac develops into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment . Mature females have a single functional ovary and two functional uteruses . Ovulation occurs at the same time as gestation , allowing females to bear young every year . The details of the smalleye hammerhead 's life history vary across its range . Off Trinidad , reproduction occurs on a well @-@ defined annual cycle with mating in August and September , and birthing in late May and June of the following year . The females carry between 5 and 12 pups for 10 months , and make use of food @-@ rich , shallow coastal bays as nursery areas . The newborns measure around 30 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 ft ) long , and males and females attain sexual maturity at 80 cm ( 31 in ) and 98 cm ( 39 in ) long respectively . By contrast , smalleye hammerheads off the northern Brazilian state of Maranhão are substantially larger , with males maturing at over 92 cm ( 36 in ) long and females at over 101 cm ( 40 in ) long . As the litter size increases with female size , Maranhão sharks have been recorded carrying up to 19 pups .

  "Brood parasitism by brown @-@ headed cowbirds is common , with up to 25 % of Carolina wren nests being affected in certain regions such as Oklahoma and Alabama . Cowbird parasitism peaks in April at 41 % , and is as low as 8 % and 0 % in July and August , respectively . Female cowbirds sometimes eject Carolina wren eggs before laying their own , and even if host eggs are retained , the size of cowbird eggs negatively affect the hatching success of wren eggs . As a result , cowbirds may have a significant impact on the reproductive success of wrens . The feeding rate for cowbird nestlings is higher than wren feeding rates , and some have been raised to independence . This also can be detrimental to the survival of wren nestlings . A rare instance of brood @-@ parasitism by a house finch has been recorded . The rate of brood parasitism is thought to be lower in more natural and concealed nesting locations . Body parasites such as the larvae of blowflies feed on nestlings and the blood loss weakens nestlings .

In accordance with the custom of the time , the campaign was conducted by surrogates , with Hayes and Tilden remaining in their respective home towns .

The Republicans emphasized the danger of letting Democrats run the nation so soon after southern Democrats provoked the Civil War and , to a lesser extent , the danger a Democratic administration would pose to the recently won civil rights of southern blacks . Democrats , for their part , trumpeted Tilden 's record of reform and contrasted it with the corruption of the incumbent Grant administration .",

  "Electronegativity is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons . An atom 's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance between the valence electrons and the nucleus . The higher its electronegativity , the more an element attracts electrons . It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932 . In general , electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period , and decreases on descending a group . Hence , fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements , while caesium is the least , at least of those elements for which substantial data is available .",
