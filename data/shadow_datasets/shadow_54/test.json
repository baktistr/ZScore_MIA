  "In 2015 Emanuel Tschopp , Octávio Mateus , and Roger Benson released a paper on diplodocoid systematics , and proposed that genera could be diagnosed by 13 differing characters , and species separated based on 6 . The minimum number for generic separation was chosen based on the fact that A. ajax and A. louisae differ in 12 characters , and Diplodocus carnegiei and D. hallorum differ in 11 characters . Thus , 13 characters were chosen to validate the separation of genera . The 6 differing features for specific separation were chosen by counting the number of differing features in separate specimens generally agreed to represent one species , with only one differing character in D. carnegiei and A. louisae , but five differing features in B. excelsus . Therefore , Tschopp et al. argued that Apatosaurus excelsus , originally classified as Brontosaurus excelsus , had enough morphological differences from other species of Apatosaurus that it warranted being reclassified as a separate genus again . The conclusion was based on a comparison of 477 morphological characteristics across 81 different dinosaur individuals . Among the many notable differences are the wider — and presumably stronger — neck of Apatosaurus species compared to B. excelsus . Other species previously assigned to Apatosaurus , such as Elosaurus parvus and Eobrontosaurus yahnahpin were also reclassified as Brontosaurus . Some features proposed to separate Brontosaurus from Apatosaurus include : posterior dorsal vertebrae with the centrum longer than wide ; the scapula rear to the acromial edge and the distal blade being excavated ; the acromial edge of the distal scapular blade bears a rounded expansion ; and the ratio of the proximodistal length to transverse breadth of the astragalus is 0 @.@ 55 or greater .

  "Regional rivalry also played an important role in the wars . The disappearance of a central , imperial authority — and in some cases of even a local , viceregal authority ( as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata ) — initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America . It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire , and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards . The original juntas of 1810 appealed first , to sense of being Spanish , which was counterposed to the French threat ; second , to a general American identity , which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French ; and third , to a sense of belonging to the local province , the patria in Spanish . More often than not , juntas sought to maintain a province 's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself . Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown . This phenomenon was particularly evident in New Granada and Río de la Plata . This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals . Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata , to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the later was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776 . The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars .",

  "In 1624 , a fatality occurred at Horsted Keynes in East Sussex when a fielder called Jasper Vinall was struck on the head by the batsman , Edward Tye , who was trying to hit the ball a second time to avoid being caught . Vinall is thus the earliest recorded cricketing fatality . The matter was recorded in a coroner 's court , which returned a verdict of misadventure . The tragedy was repeated in 1647 when another fatality was recorded at Selsey in West Sussex , a player called Henry Brand being hit on the head by a batsman trying to hit the ball a second time . When the first Laws of cricket were encoded in 1744 , it was illegal to hit the ball twice and a batsman breaking the rule was to be given out . The record of the 1624 case confirms that two villages , Horsted Keynes and West Hoathly , were involved in the match and provides further evidence of the growth of village cricket .",

  "The first three volumes are set in the 1920s and follow the main characters through school , university and their first steps towards social and professional acceptance . The next three are placed in the 1930s ; the protagonists become established , put down roots , watch the international situation anxiously and prepare for war . The background for the seventh , eighth and ninth volumes is the Second World War , which not all the characters survive . The final three books cover the 25 years from the early days of the post @-@ war Attlee government to the counterculture and protests of the early 1970s . During the long narrative , the focus changes frequently from one group to another ; new faces appear while established characters are written out , sometimes reappearing after many volumes , sometimes not at all , though news of their doings may reach Jenkins , through one or other of his many acquaintances . Apart from Jenkins , Widmerpool is the only one of the 300 @-@ odd characters who takes part in the action of each of the 12 volumes . Richard Jones , writing in the Virginia Quarterly Review , suggests that the novels may be regarded as \" the dance of Kenneth Widmerpool , who is Jenkins 's fall @-@ guy , tormentor , and antithesis \" . Widmerpool dogs Jenkins 's career and life ; in the opening pages of the first book at school , he is encountered running through the mists , in the vain hope of athletic glory . In the final stages of the last book he is running again , this time at the behest of the quasi @-@ religious cult that has claimed him .",

  "Unknown ( also known as Unknown Worlds ) was an American pulp fantasy fiction magazine , published from 1939 to 1943 by Street & Smith , and edited by John W. Campbell . Unknown was a companion to Street & Smith 's science fiction pulp , Astounding Science Fiction , which was also edited by Campbell at the time ; many authors and illustrators contributed to both magazines . The leading fantasy magazine in the 1930s was Weird Tales , which focused on shock and horror . Campbell wanted to publish a fantasy magazine with more finesse and humor than Weird Tales , and put his plans into action when Eric Frank Russell sent him the manuscript of his novel Sinister Barrier , about aliens who own the human race . Unknown 's first issue appeared in March 1939 ; in addition to Sinister Barrier , it included H. L. Gold 's \" Trouble With Water \" , a humorous fantasy about a New Yorker who meets a water gnome . Gold 's story was the first of many in Unknown to combine commonplace reality with the fantastic .",
  "A weary Emperor who no longer cared for the throne , an heir who had no desire to assume the crown , an increasingly discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs : all these factors presaged the monarchy 's impending doom .

  "Assessments of the mating system of this species have found that outcrossing rates vary between populations , with populations in disturbed environments tending to be more inbred than populations in relatively intact bushland . This has been attributed to a range of causes . Firstly , the higher density of disturbed populations leads to greater rates of mating between neighbouring plants , resulting in more genetic structure and thus more effective selfing . Secondly , disturbed populations usually lack an understorey , and so cannot support a resident population of honeyeaters ; instead , they rely upon sporadic visits for pollination . The greatly reduced pollination rates means fewer outcrossing fertilisations on average , leading to less selection against inbred fertilisations .",

Unlike cattle or goats , which have straight cervices that can be vaginally inseminated , ewes have a curved cervix which is more difficult to access . Additionally , breeders were until recently unable to control their ewe 's estrus cycles . The ability to control the estrus cycle is much easier today because of products that safely assist in aligning heat cycles . Some examples of products are PG600 , CIDRs , Estrumate and Folltropin V. These products contain progesterone which will bring on the induction of estrus in ewes ( sheep ) during seasonal anestrus . Seasonal anestrus is when ewes do not have regular estrous cycles outside the natural breeding season .",

  "In the Renaissance , a character named \" Thelemia \" represents will or desire in the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili of the Dominican monk Francesco Colonna . The protagonist Poliphilo has two allegorical guides , Logistica ( reason ) and Thelemia ( will or desire ) . When forced to choose , he chooses fulfillment of his sexual will over logic . Colonna 's work was a great influence on the Franciscan monk François Rabelais , who in the 16th century , used Thélème , the French form of the word , as the name of a fictional abbey in his novels , Gargantua and Pantagruel . The only rule of this Abbey was \" fay çe que vouldras \" ( \" Fais ce que tu veux \" , or , \" Do what thou wilt \" ) .

  "Sigma Phi Epsilon ( \" Sig Ep \" ) at Dartmouth College was founded on April 22 , 1908 , as the local fraternity Omicron Pi Sigma . In 1909 , the local fraternity became New Hampshire Alpha Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon . By the late 1960s , the house had become disenchanted with the national organization and felt that the Dartmouth membership would be better served as a local fraternity . The brothers voted to dissociate from the national organization on January 18 , 1967 . A vote of the alumni of the New Hampshire Alpha chapter on February 1 , 1967 , supported the decision . The new local fraternity adopted the name Sigma Theta Epsilon ( which was also used by an unrelated national fraternity ) . The Sigma Phi Epsilon national continued to communicate with the local Sigma Theta Epsilon fraternity at Dartmouth , and by 1981 was willing to offer significant financial support for building renovations in exchange for reaffiliation . Convinced that the national organization had reformed in its commitment to the individual chapters , the local fraternity voted to rejoin Sigma Phi Epsilon on February 18 , 1981 . The national Sigma Phi Epsilon organization is known for its Balanced Man Program , an ongoing program of development through which members challenge themselves and to use their different talents and backgrounds to help each other become balanced men ( having a Sound Mind in a Sound Body ) and balanced servant leaders for the world 's communities . Members of Sigma Phi Epsilon become members the moment they join the fraternity , without having to endure a traditional pledge period . However , they commit to taking on a series of personal and leadership development challenges for the rest of their time as an undergraduate . The New Hampshire Alpha Chapter of Sigma Phi Epsilon was actually the first chapter to adopt the Balanced Man Program . Prominent alumni of the New Hampshire Alpha chapter include Theodor S.

  "In the early 20th century there was a revival in interest in mediaeval woodcuts , particularly in religious books such as the Biblia pauperum . The woodcut is a less refined medium than the wood engraving that replaced it — artists of the time took to the rougher woodcut to express angst and frustration . From 1917 Masereel began publishing books of woodcut prints , using similar imagery to make political statements on the strife of the common people rather than to illustrate the lives of Christ and the saints . In 1918 he created the first such book to feature a narrative , 25 Images of a Man 's Passion , which is thus the earliest example of the wordless novel genre .",

  "White dwarfs were found to be extremely dense soon after their discovery . If a star is in a binary system , as is the case for Sirius B or 40 Eridani B , it is possible to estimate its mass from observations of the binary orbit . This was done for Sirius B by 1910 , yielding a mass estimate of 0 @.@ 94 M ☉ . ( A more modern estimate is 1 @.@ 00 M ☉ . ) Since hotter bodies radiate more energy than colder ones , a star 's surface brightness can be estimated from its effective surface temperature , and that from its spectrum . If the star 's distance is known , its absolute ( overall ) luminosity can also be estimated . From the absolute luminosity and distance , the star 's surface area and its radius can be calculated . Reasoning of this sort led to the realization , puzzling to astronomers at the time , that Sirius B and 40 Eridani B must be very dense . When Ernst Öpik estimated the density of a number of visual binary stars in 1916 , he found that 40 Eridani B had a density of over 25 @,@ 000 times the Sun 's , which was so high that he called it \" impossible \" .

  "Weinman never disclosed the name of the model for the obverse , and no person ever claimed to have been her . The winged Liberty is widely believed , however , to have been based on a 1913 bust Weinman sculpted of Elsie Stevens , wife of Wallace Stevens . A lawyer and insurance executive , Wallace Stevens later became famous as a poet ; Wallace and Elsie Stevens rented an apartment from Weinman from 1909 to 1916 . In a draft of his unpublished autobiography , Woolley wrote that Weinman refused to name the model , but told him it was the wife of a lawyer who lived above his Manhattan apartment . ( Woolley , in a later version , omitted the location , saying only that Weinman said it was the wife of a lawyer friend . ) Woolley recorded that he was told that the model wore the top of an old pair of stockings to simulate the cap . In 1966 , Holly Stevens , Wallace and Elsie 's daughter , noted in her edition of her father 's letters that Elsie had been the model for Weinman 's dime and half dollar . Liberty 's features also bear a resemblance to the face of Victory in Weinman 's 1909 statuary group erected in Baltimore , the Union Soldiers and Sailors ' Monument .",

  "Executions were a common feature of the Roman games . They took place around midday as an interlude between the animal entertainments of the morning sessions and the gladiatorial combat in the afternoon . Although the executions were seen as symbolizing Rome 's power , the higher classes normally took advantage of this interval to leave the arena to dine ; the Emperor Claudius was criticised by some authors for not doing so , so it is unlikely that Titus would have watched this part of the show . The executions of deserters , prisoners @-@ of @-@ war , and criminals from the lower classes were normally crucifixions or damnatio ad bestias in which they would face wild animals . Scipio Aemilianus had been the first to execute criminals in this way when he had deserters from his army exposed to wild beasts in 146 BC . These executions often took the form of the re @-@ creation of some tragic scene from history or mythology with the criminal cast in the role of the victim killed by wild beasts .

It was also central to the staging of lavish display that portrayed the political and religious role of the monarchy . This display was often tied up with ideas of chivalry , which was evolving in this period from a practical military ethos into a more ornamental and honorific cult .

  "Puppies of all colours can potentially occur in the same litter . Colour is determined primarily by three genes . The first gene ( the B locus ) determines the density of the coat 's eumelanin pigment granules , if that pigment is allowed : dense granules result in a black coat , sparse ones give a chocolate coat . The second ( E ) locus determines whether the eumelanin is produced at all . A dog with the recessive e allele will produce only phaeomelanin pigment and will be yellow regardless of its genotype at the B locus . The genes known about previously have had their number increased by the introduction of the K locus , where the dominant \" black \" allele KB is now known to reside . Black or chocolate Labradors therefore must have the KB allele . Yellow Labradors are determined at the E locus , so the K locus is irrelevant in determining their colour . Variations in numerous other genes control the subtler details of the coat 's colouration , which in yellow Labradors varies from white to light gold to a fox red . Chocolate and black Labradors ' noses will match the coat colour .",

His batting average also fell . Surrey experienced disciplinary problems with several of their professional players during the season . The club president , Lord Alverstone , favoured amateurs , arguing that a losing amateur team was preferable to a professional side that won ; several professionals were left out in favour of amateurs . Apart from adversely affecting some players ' careers , this preference had destabilised the team over several seasons .

  "First described as a variety of what was then known as Embothrium wickhamii by Joseph Maiden and Ernst Betche in 1911 after a collection by J.L.Boorman , the Dorrigo waratah was raised to species status and reclassified as Oreocallis pinnata by Dutch botanist Hermann Otto Sleumer in 1954 . The Australian members of the genus Oreocallis were recognised as markedly distinct from the South American species , which saw them allocated to the new genus Alloxylon . Hence , Oreocallis pinnata was given the new combination Alloxylon pinnatum in 1991 by Peter Weston and Mike Crisp of the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney . The species name refers to the pinnate leaves . Aside from Dorrigo waratah , it has also been called the Dorrigo oak , red silky oak , tree waratah , pink silky oak , red oak , Queensland waratah , and waratah oak . The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek allo- , meaning \" other \" or \" strange \" , and xylon , meaning \" wood \" . It refers to the genus 's unusual cell architecture compared with the related genera Telopea and Oreocallis .",

  "AMS counts the atoms of 14C and 12C in a given sample , determining the 14C / 12C ratio directly . The sample , often in the form of graphite , is made to emit C − ions ( carbon atoms with a single negative charge ) , which are injected into an accelerator . The ions are accelerated and passed through a stripper , which removes several electrons so that the ions emerge with a positive charge . The C3 + ions are then passed through a magnet that curves their path ; the heavier ions are curved less than the lighter ones , so the different isotopes emerge as separate streams of ions . A particle detector then records the number of ions detected in the 14C stream , but since the volume of 12C ( and 13C , needed for calibration ) is too great for individual ion detection , counts are determined by measuring the electric current created in a Faraday cup . Some AMS facilities are also able to evaluate a sample 's fractionation , another piece of data necessary for calculating the sample 's radiocarbon age .",

Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse .",
  "Verses 12 @.@ 23 – 31 state that the lingasharira , which is the subtle body that is not visible , glistens in the central region of the body or the heart or the forehead . This shining Shakti ( force , energy , power ) , translates Bhattacharya , is realised by the knower of Brahman through his concentrated vision . Atman is perceived when the mind located in the space between the eyebrows , becomes free of all distractions and activities . In this state , the yogin becomes aware of self within , and in the sages , in siddhas and others . If dissolution of the mind in the space between the eye brows does not occur , the yogin should envision absolute bliss , alternatively the full moon inside the mouth . This helps the mind dissolve away distractions and activity , helping it reside in Vishnupada or the Akasha ( sky ) , and brings the yogin closer to moksha or liberation . This is a stage where the feeling of liberation and bliss begins to emerge , the goal of the practice of yoga .",
  "Populations of the peregrine falcon have bounced back in most parts of the world . In Britain , there has been a recovery of populations since the crash of the 1960s .

Peregrines now breed in many mountainous and coastal areas , especially in the west and north , and nest in some urban areas , capitalising on the urban feral pigeon populations for food . In Southampton , a nest prevented restoration of mobile telephony services for several months , after Vodafone engineers despatched to repair a faulty transmitter mast discovered a nest in the mast , and were prevented by the Wildlife and Countryside Act , on pain of a possible prison sentence , from proceeding with repairs until the chicks fledged . In many parts of the world peregrine falcons have adapted to urban habitats , nesting on cathedrals , skyscraper window ledges , tower blocks , and the towers of suspension bridges . Many of these nesting birds are encouraged , sometimes gathering media attention and often monitored by cameras .",

  "Giant subfossil lemurs are thought to have also played a significant role in seed dispersal , possibly targeting species that did not attract the seed dispersal services of the extinct elephant birds . Biogeochemistry studies have shown that they may have been the primary seed dispersers for the endemic and native C3 trees in the spiny forests . Terrestrial species may even have dispersed seeds for small bushes in addition to tall trees . Seed dispersal can involve passing seeds through the gut ( endozoochory ) or attaching the seeds to the animal 's body ( epizoochory ) , and both processes probably occurred with subfossil lemurs . Seeds from Uncarina species embed themselves in lemur fur , and likely did the same with subfossil lemurs . Seed dispersal biology is known for very few species in the spiny forest , including genera of plants suspected of depending on giant lemurs , such as Adansonia , Cedrelopsis , Commiphora , Delonix , Diospyros , Grewia , Pachypodium , Salvadora , Strychnos , and Tamarindus . For example , Delonix has edible pods that are rich in protein , and Adansonia fruits have a nutritious pulp and large seeds that may have been dispersed by Archaeolemur majori or Pachylemur insignis .",

Having yet to perform the sociological investigation that would culminate in A Community of Witches , Berger gained her information for this lecture from the information published in the works of Margot Adler , Starhawk and Marcello Truzzi , and also from a singular interview that she had carried out with a woman who was \" peripherally associated \" with Paganism .

  "For Cagney 's next film , he traveled to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil , directed by Michael Anderson . Cagney had hoped to spend some time tracing his Irish ancestry , but time constraints and poor weather meant that he was unable to do so . The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander , and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years .",

  "The genetic heritability of Alzheimer 's disease ( and memory components thereof ) , based on reviews of twin and family studies , range from 49 % to 79 % . Around 0 @.@ 1 % of the cases are familial forms of autosomal ( not sex @-@ linked ) dominant inheritance , which have an onset before age 65 . This form of the disease is known as early onset familial Alzheimer 's disease . Most of autosomal dominant familial AD can be attributed to mutations in one of three genes : those encoding amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) and presenilins 1 and 2 . Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42 , which is the main component of senile plaques . Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms — particularly Aβ40 — without increasing Aβ42 levels . This suggests that presenilin mutations can cause disease even if they lower the total amount of Aβ produced and may point to other roles of presenilin or a role for alterations in the function of APP and / or its fragments other than Aβ . There exist variants of the APP gene which are protective .",

  "The first notable person to be fascinated with the supposed prophecy of the Fourth Eclogue and its potential references to Jesus was Constantine the Great , Roman emperor from AD 306 to 337 , and he used part of it in an address he gave to the \" Assembly of the Saints \" , which was preserved by the Roman historian Eusebius in his work Vita Constantini . Constantine interpreted the entire work himself although he omitted a few lines that overtly reference paganism , such as the last part of line 10 , which names Apollo . Constantine assigned the roles of the virgo in line 6 to the Blessed Virgin Mary , the puer in lines 8 , 18 , 60 , and 62 is Christ , the lions in line 22 to the persecutors of Christians , and the serpent in line 24 to the Serpent of Evil . Constantine argued that the Assyrian flower in line 25 represented the race of people , i.e. the Assyrians , who were \" leader [ s ] in the faith of Christ \" , and that references in line 30 meant that \" those who had borne hardships for the sake of God would perceive that the fruit of their endurance was sweet . \" The emperor also interpreted the reference to Achilles fighting against Troy in lines 34 @-@ 36 as a reference to Christ ( the \" new \" Achilles ) waging a war against the forces of evil ( the \" new \" Troy ) .

  "The album 's opening track is \" Survival \" .

It has a lyrical allusion to the singer 's 1986 single \" Live to Tell \" , with double @-@ tracked strong vocals and harmonies . In the song , Madonna enhanced the rhythmic sounds more and compressed the bass sounds , in order to cater to the then musical trend . Containing multiple hooks , \" Survival \" ' s lyrics are about dualities like heaven / hell , up / down , angels / saints . \" Secret \" , the second song , begins with just the sound of Madonna 's voice singing over a rhythmic , folksy guitar in descending chord sequence , before opening up to a sparse , retro rhythm section . A deep percussion starts around the one minute mark , accompanied by wah @-@ wah ascending string line , supporting the descending guitar . Towards the end , an upper harmonic melody is added to display variance . Madonna 's voice remains at the center of the song 's production , as she sings lyrics such as \" happiness lies in your own hand \" . Throughout the song , Madonna also sings the lyrics \" My baby 's got a secret \" , however she never discloses what the secret may be . During the next song , \" I 'd Rather Be Your Lover \" , Madonna lusts after the unattainable through processes of negotiation : \" I could be your sister , I could be your mother , We could be friends , I 'd even be your brother \" . Towards the middle of the song , an eight bar rap break is taken by singer and rapper Meshell Ndegeocello , who raps : \" Tell me what you want / Tell me what you need ... \" . Madonna interrupts , with her voice foregrounded and juxtaposed over the short interjections of Ndegeocello 's rap part .

  "Broaching is a machining process that uses a toothed tool , called a broach , to remove material . There are two main types of broaching : linear and rotary . In linear broaching , which is the more common process , the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut . Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine , which is also sometimes shortened to broach . In rotary broaching , the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axis symmetric shape . A rotary broach is used in a lathe or screw machine . In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach , which makes it very efficient .",

  "To many people across the world , the house sparrow is the most familiar wild animal and , because of its association with humans and familiarity , it is frequently used to represent the common and vulgar , or the lewd . One of the reasons for the introduction of house sparrows throughout the world was their association with the European homeland of many immigrants . Birds usually described later as sparrows are referred to in many works of ancient literature and religious texts in Europe and western Asia . These references may not always refer specifically to the house sparrow , or even to small , seed @-@ eating birds , but later writers who were inspired by these texts often had the house sparrow in mind . In particular , sparrows were associated by the ancient Greeks with Aphrodite , the goddess of love , due to their perceived lustfulness , an association echoed by later writers such as Chaucer and Shakespeare . Jesus 's use of \" sparrows \" as an example of divine providence in the Gospel of Matthew also inspired later references , such as that in Shakespeare 's Hamlet and the Gospel hymn His Eye Is on the Sparrow .",

  "Freemasons , members of a European fraternal organization that attained its modern form in the early eighteenth century , developed many pseudohistorical origin myths that traced Freemasonry back to ancient times . Egypt was among the civilizations that Masons claimed had influenced their traditions . After Sethos was published , several Masonic lodges developed rites based on those in the novel . Late in the century , Masonic writers , still assuming that Sethos was an ancient story , used the obvious resemblance between their rites and the initiation of Sethos as evidence of Freemasonry 's supposedly ancient origin . Many works of fiction from the 1790s to the 1820s reused and modified the signature traits of Terrasson 's Egyptian initiation : trials by three or four elements , often taking place under the pyramids . The best @-@ known of these works is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's 1791 opera The Magic Flute , in which the main character , Tamino , undergoes a series of trials overseen by priests who invoke Isis and Osiris .",

A mishap occurred during the shoot when Tony Vogel slipped and broke his wrist . Filming continued at Ealing Film Studios between 13 and 15 May covering the elements that would be played into the screens on the set during studio recording such as the Sportsex , Artsex and Foodshow programmes as well as the audience reaction shots . The scene where Kin Hodder falls to his death was also shot at Ealing . Following rehearsals , the production moved to BBC Television Centre between 12 and 14 June . Industrial action by BBC electricians interrupted the production and by the end of the recording session , the final ten minutes of the play remained untaped , leading to a remount on 23 June to complete the outstanding scenes .",
  "Tiber comprises multiple Lower Tertiary petroleum reservoirs located in Keathley Canyon block 102 about 250 mi ( 400 km ) southeast of Houston and 300 mi ( 480 km ) south west of New Orleans . Tiber is only the 18th Lower Tertiary well to date , and drilling in these formations is in its infancy . The oil from Tiber is light crude , and early estimates of recoverable reserves are around 20 – 30 % recovery , suggesting figures of around 600 to 900 million barrels ( 95 × 10 ^ 6 to 143 × 10 ^ 6 m3 ) of reserves . Sources such as Bloomberg suggest caution , warning that the find is technically complex and potentially could take 5 – 6 years to produce oil or be lower yield ( 5 – 15 % ) based on \" rates talked about \" at nearby Kaskida Oil Field , BP 's previous giant find ( 2006 ) 40 mi ( 64 km ) away .

Indie developers began to incorporate roguelike elements into genres not normally associated with roguelikes , creating games that would form the basis of this new subgenre . Two of the earliest cited examples of roguelike @-@ likes are Strange Adventures in Infinite Space ( 2002 ) and its sequel Weird Worlds : Return to Infinite Space ( 2005 ) by Digital Eel , both space exploration games that included randomly generated planets and encounters , and permadeath .

  "Robert Gottschalk founded Panavision in late 1953 , in partnership with Richard Moore , Meredith Nicholson , Harry Eller , Walter Wallin , and William Mann ; the company was formally incorporated in 1954 . Panavision was established principally for the manufacture of anamorphic projection lenses to meet the growing demands of theaters showing CinemaScope films . At the time of Panavision 's formation , Gottschalk owned a camera shop in Westwood Village , California , where many of his customers were cinematographers . A few years earlier , he and Moore — who worked with him in the camera shop — were experimenting with underwater photography ; Gottschalk became interested in the technology of anamorphic lenses , which allowed him to get a wider field of view from his underwater camera housing . The technology was created during World War I to increase the field of view on tank periscopes ; the periscope image was horizontally \" squeezed \" by the anamorphic lens . After it was unsqueezed by a complementary anamorphic optical element , the tank operator could see double the horizontal field of view without significant distortion . Gottschalk and Moore bought some of these lenses from C. P. Goerz , a New York optics company , for use in their underwater photography . As widescreen filmmaking became popular , Gottschalk saw an opportunity to provide anamorphic lenses to the film industry — first for projectors , and then for cameras . Nicholson , a friend of Moore , started working as a cameraman on early tests of anamorphic photography .",

  "In the 1830s , plans were drawn up to build the new London and Birmingham Railway . From an engineering perspective , the ideal route for the railway ran through the site of the castle , but concerns over the need to protect ancient monuments and buildings had been growing for several years , and the local Bridgwater estate were also keen to protect the local view from their buildings . The castle was ultimately specifically protected in the 1833 act that sanctioned the railway , forcing the track to take a route across the valley floor . Berkhamsted was the first building in Britain to receive statutory protection from development in this way . Nonetheless , the route still required the track to pass through the outer fortifications of the castle , a major engineering operation which was carried out in 1834 , destroying the castle gatehouse in the process .",

The facilities were felt to be inadequate and the crowds of spectators who gathered outside the prison to see inmates being taken into York for execution unseemly . Attempts were made to improve the way executions were carried out from 1803 onwards : the former castle courtyard , the Eye of the Ridings , was used for this purpose instead , although crowds still gathered outside the bailey to watch the slow deaths of the prisoners . By 1813 the execution process had been sped up by the introduction of the \" short drop \" method of hanging , allowing the unusually rapid execution of fourteen Luddite agitators at the castle in 1814 . Overcrowding in the jail was now also a problem , with up to 114 prisoners being held at any one time ; occasionally , around forty prisoners awaiting trial had to be kept in the jail yard for lack of space elsewhere .",

  "Ground deicing technologies are also developing , and a newer technology is infrared deicing . This is the transmission of energy by means of electromagnetic waves or rays . Infrared is invisible and travels in straight lines from the heat source to surfaces and objects without significantly heating the space ( air ) it passes through . When infrared waves strike an object , they release their energy as heat . This heat is either absorbed or reflected by the cooler surface . Infrared energy is continually exchanged between \" hot \" and \" cold \" surfaces until all surfaces have reached the same temperature ( equilibrium ) . The colder the surfaces , the more effective the infrared transfer from the emitter . This heat transfer mechanism is substantially faster than conventional heat transfer modes used by conventional deicing ( convection and conduction ) due to the cooling effect of the air on the deicing fluid spray .",

  "In June 1390 , Alexander Stewart , Robert III 's brother , burned the cathedral , manses and burgh of Elgin . This fire was very destructive , requiring the central tower to be completely rebuilt along with the principal arcades of the nave . The entire western gable between the towers was reconstructed and the main west doorway and chapterhouse were refashioned . The internal stonework of the entrance is late 14th or early 15th century and is intricately carved with branches , vines , acorns and oak leaves . A large pointed arch opening in the gable immediately above the main door contained a series of windows , the uppermost of which was a circular or rose window dating from between 1422 and 1435 . Just above it can be seen three coats of arms : on the right is that of the bishopric of Moray , in the middle are the Royal Arms of Scotland , and on the left is the armorial shield of Bishop Columba Dunbar ( Fig . 11 ) . The walls of the nave are now very low or even at foundation level , except one section in the south wall which is near its original height . This section has windows that appear to have been built in the 15th century to replace the 13th century openings : they may have been constructed following the 1390 attack ( Fig . 12 ) . Nothing of the elevated structure of the nave remains , but its appearance can be deduced from the scarring seen where it attached to the eastern walls of the towers . Nothing of the crossing now remains following the collapse of the central tower in 1711 . Elgin Cathedral is unique in Scotland in having an English style octagonal chapterhouse and French influenced double aisles along each side of the nave ; in England , only Chichester Cathedral has similar aisles . The chapterhouse , which had been attached to the choir through a short vaulted vestry , required substantial modifications and was now provided with a vaulted roof supported by a single pillar ( Figs . 13 & 14 ) . The chapterhouse measures 10 @.@ 3 metres ( 34 ft ) high at its apex and 11 @.@ 3 metres ( 37 ft ) from wall to opposite wall ; it was substantially rebuilt by Bishop Andrew Stewart ( 1482 – 1501 ) , whose coat of arms is placed on the central pillar .

  "A diaphoneme is an abstract phonological unit that identifies a correspondence between related sounds of two or more varieties of a language or language cluster . For example , the vowel that constitutes the English word eye is pronounced differently depending on dialect ( [ aɪ ̯ ] or [ ʌɪ ̯ ] in RP and General American , [ ae ̯ ] or [ əi ̯ ] in Scottish English , [ ɑɪ ̯ ] in Australian English , [ ɔɪ ̯ ] in Irish English , [ aː ] in South African English , and [ aː ] or [ əi ̯ ] in Southern American English , etc . ) but , in the appropriate context , all of these variants are perceived by speakers as equivalent , and thus constitute a single diaphoneme . The word diaphone was originally used with the same meaning , but was later repurposed to refer to any of the particular variants , making the relationship between diaphoneme and diaphone analogous to that between phoneme and allophone .",

  "Similar to Guitar Hero : Aerosmith , Metallica presents songs from Metallica 's history roughly in chronological order , but it focuses more on the group today than the band 's history . The songs in the game are presented in a linear series of sets as with older Guitar Hero games such as Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock , instead of the gig progression used in World Tour . However , instead of being required to finish a certain number of songs in each set , the player has to earn a total number of stars ( earned from their performance on the individual songs ) in a given set to progress to next one . The game 's story is based on a band that wants to follow in Metallica 's footsteps , and the group accepting them as leading acts for them on a tour ; as such , they are better able to order the songs in difficulty comparable to other Guitar Hero games , as Metallica 's earlier works frustrate the player enough to \" throw the controller against the wall and stop playing \" . Flores described the difficulty for most of the game to be comparable to Guitar Hero : Aerosmith and World Tour after the complaints of the difficulty level in Guitar Hero III , but further noted that the most difficult songs in the games will be very challenging .

  "During his time in America , Grimshaw had developed pro @-@ Confederacy tendencies . In general , there was some support for the Confederacy among people who were affected by the shortage in cotton from America caused by the American Civil War , such as traders and mill @-@ owners . On a personal level , Grimshaw was opposed to the growth of capitalism in the United States and described the notions of American freedom and liberty as \" farce and humbug \" . In 1862 he became part of a small group of working @-@ class Lancashire men , all of whom had been involved in various strikes in the 1850s , assembled by Liverpool @-@ based tin plate merchant James Spence .

  "Within the brain , dopamine functions partly as a \" global reward signal \" , where an initial phasic dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about the salience , value , and context of a reward . In the context of reward @-@ related learning , dopamine also functions as a reward prediction error signal , that is , the degree to which the value of a reward is unexpected . According to this hypothesis of Wolfram Schultz , rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells , but rewards that are unexpected , or greater than expected , produce a short @-@ lasting increase in synaptic dopamine , whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level . The \" prediction error \" hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists , because an influential computational @-@ learning method known as temporal difference learning makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error .

  "The degree to which any one of these forces held sway over others is unclear . Preference for one explanation over another is sometimes predicated upon a given political viewpoint . The cumulative effect of these dynamics is that by the beginning of the 20th century the Plains Aborigines were almost completely acculturated into the larger ethnic Han group , and had experienced nearly total language shift from their respective Formosan languages to Chinese . In addition , legal barriers to the use of traditional surnames persisted until recently , and cultural barriers remain . Aborigines were not permitted to use their traditional names on official identification cards until 1995 when a ban on using aboriginal names dating from 1946 was finally lifted .

( Richardson himself had died earlier that year , and his three main associates were carrying on his work as the firm Shepley , Rutan and Coolidge . ) This group of architects are noted for the Richardsonian Romanesque style , and features of that style including \" round low arches , sturdy piers , massive walls , simple silhouettes , and sheltering roofs \" are prominent in the Quad . The style was adapted to a California Mission theme . The primary building materials were local yellow sandstone and red tile roofs . The sandstone was quarried at the Graystone Quarry in San Jose , California , and transported to the building site via a private railway spur . Hundreds of unskilled laborers received the sandstone , cut it to size , dressed it , and finished it ; skilled stonecutters and sculptors , primarily from Italy , installed it and embellished it with friezes . Over the objections of the architects , the Stanfords insisted that the main entrance to the Quad be \" a large memorial arch with an enormously large approach \" .

  "The gigantic bones attributed to A. fragillimus have often been ignored in summaries of the largest dinosaurs partly because , according to various subsequent reports , the whereabouts of both the vertebra and the femur are unknown , and all attempts to locate them have failed . Carpenter , in 2006 , presented a possible scenario for the disappearance of the A. fragillimus specimens . As Cope noted in his description , the neural arch bone material was very fragile , and techniques to harden and preserve fossil bone had not yet been invented ( Cope 's rival , paleontologist O.C. Marsh , was the first to use such chemicals , in the early 1880s ) . Carpenter observed that the fossil bones known from the A. fragillimus quarry would have been preserved in deeply weathered mudstone , which tends to crumble easily and fragment into small , irregular cubes . Therefore , the bone may have crumbled badly and been discarded by someone at the American Museum of Natural History ( possibly even by Cope himself ) soon after he illustrated it in rear view for his paper . Carpenter suggested that this may explain why Cope drew the vertebra in only one view , rather than from multiple angles as he did for his other discoveries .",

In early December , Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December . On 11 and 12 December Solidarity 's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest .

David used his Cistercian connections to build a bond with Henry Murdac , the new archbishop .

  "The mantled howler gets the name \" howler \" from the calls made by the males , particularly at dawn and dusk , but also in response to disturbances . These calls are very loud and can be heard for several kilometers . The calls consist of grunts and repeated roars that can last for four to five seconds each . The volume is produced by the hyoid bone — a hollow bone near the vocal cords — amplifying the sound made by the vocal cords . Male mantled howlers have hyoid bones that are 25 times larger than similarly sized spider monkeys , and this allows the bone to act like the body of a drum in amplifying the calls . Females also call but their calls are higher in pitch and not as loud as the males ' . The ability to produce these loud roars is likely an energy saving device , consistent with the mantled howler 's low energy diet . The roars allow the monkey to locate each other without moving around or risking physical confrontations . The mantled howler uses a wide range of other sounds , including barks , grunts , woofs , cackles and screeches . It uses clucking sounds to maintain auditory contact with other members of its group .",

  "The most spectacular of Bath 's terraces is the Royal Crescent , built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood . But all is not what it seems ; while Wood designed the great curved façade of what appears to be about 30 houses with Ionic columns on a rusticated ground floor , that was the extent of his input . Each purchaser bought a certain length of the façade , and then employed their own architect to build a house to their own specifications behind it ; hence what appears to be two houses is sometimes one . This system of town planning is betrayed at the rear of the crescent : while the front is completely uniform and symmetrical , the rear is a mixture of differing roof heights , juxtapositions and fenestration . This \" Queen Anne fronts and Mary @-@ Anne backs \" architecture occurs repeatedly in Bath .

  "These moves were met with some criticism , as the preserved counties were created to sustain a stable and continuing layout , irrespective of interim local government reviews affecting principal areas . This led to some areas , such as the Aberconwy district , moving to a preserved county it had never been administered by in the past , and therefore these moves went generally unreported due to the preserved county 's limited status .

  "At high altitudes , Neptune 's atmosphere is 80 % hydrogen and 19 % helium . A trace amount of methane is also present . Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm , in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum . As with Uranus , this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of what gives Neptune its blue hue , although Neptune 's vivid azure differs from Uranus 's milder cyan . Because Neptune 's atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus , some unknown atmospheric constituent is thought to contribute to Neptune 's colour .",

  "The Royal Navy repaired Chesapeake and took her into service as HMS Chesapeake . She served on the Halifax station under the command of Alexander Dixie through 1814 , and under the command of George Burdett she sailed to Plymouth , England , for repairs in October of that year . Afterward she made a voyage to Cape Town , South Africa , until learning of the peace treaty with the United States in May 1815 . Later that year a report was made concerning Chesapeake 's performance in British service . Her captain observed that she was strongly constructed , but criticized the excessive overhang of the stern . He concluded that she was not a suitable ship to serve as a model for copying . Her speed under sail was not particularly impressive : 9 kn ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) close @-@ hauled and 11 kn ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) large .

  "The early twentieth @-@ century historian W. H.

Both Asser and the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle say that Æthelwulf gave a decimation , in 855 , shortly before leaving on pilgrimage to Rome . According to the Chronicle \" King Æthelwulf conveyed by charter the tenth part of his land throughout all his kingdom to the praise of God and to his own eternal salvation \" . However , Asser states that \" Æthelwulf , the esteemed king , freed the tenth part of his whole kingdom from royal service and tribute , and as an everlasting inheritance he made it over on the cross of Christ to the triune God , for the redemption of his soul and those of his predecessors . \" According to Keynes , Asser 's version may just be a \" loose translation \" of the Chronicle , and his implication that Æthelwulf released a tenth of all land from secular burdens was probably not intended . All land could be regarded as the king 's land , so the Chronicle reference to \" his land \" does not necessarily refer to royal property , and since the booking of land – conveying it by charter – was always regarded as a pious act , Asser 's statement that he made it over to God does not necessarily mean that the charters were in favour of the church .",

  "At the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers , young salmon that swim down from spawning gravels in the headwaters of the Clearwater River often delay their migrations because of a significant temperature difference .

The fire had spread rapidly , and although high winds contributed to the intensity , authorities deemed the speed with which the house had become fully involved suspicious enough to bring in arson investigators . The bodies of Tim and Kelly were not recovered until the following morning , when the house had cooled enough to permit safe searching . Kelly had perished in her bed , most likely of smoke inhalation . Tim 's body was found on the ground floor , near the kitchen . Investigators at first assumed he had died trying to escape , but later determined that he had perished in or near his bedroom , most likely of smoke inhalation and heat , and that his body had fallen through burned flooring to where it was discovered .",
  "Starting around 1200 BC , the coast of Anatolia was heavily settled by Aeolian and Ionian Greeks . Numerous important cities were founded by these colonists , such as Miletus , Ephesus , Smyrna ( now İzmir ) and Byzantium ( now Istanbul ) , the latter founded by Greek colonists from Megara in 657 BC .

In Northwest Turkey , the most significant tribal group in Thrace was the Odyrisians , founded by Teres I.",
  "Lê Duẩn departed from Marxist / Leninist orthodoxy when it came to practical policy and stated that the country had to \" carry out agricultural cooperation immediately , even before having built large industry . \" While he acknowledged that his view was heresy , Lê Duẩn insisted that Vietnam was in a unique situation ; \" It seems that no country so far in history has been in a situation such as ours . We must lead the peasantry and agriculture immediately to socialism , without waiting for a developed industry , though we know very well that without the strong impact of industry , agriculture cannot achieve large @-@ scale production and new relations of agriculture cannot be consolidated ... To proceed from small @-@ scale production to large @-@ scale production is a new one . \" According to Lê Duẩn the key to socialism was not mechanisation and industrialisation , but a new division of labour . He also believed that cooperatives did not need to be autarkic , but rather \" organically connected , through the process of production itself , with other cooperatives and with the state economic sector . \" Vietnam could achieve this through state intervention and control . He saw the economy as one whole directed by the state and not many parts intertwined .",

Eden rejected the criticism and argued that the UK 's decision was unanimous and asserted that the Battle of Greece delayed Operation Barbarossa , the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union .

One torpedo sank Conte di Cavour in shallow water , but Giulio Cesare was not hit during the attack .

  "Somewhat related to hardness is another mechanical property toughness , which is a material 's ability to resist breakage from forceful impact . The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 7 @.@ 5 – 10 MPa · m1 / 2 . This value is good compared to other ceramic materials , but poor compared to most engineering materials such as engineering alloys , which typically exhibit toughnesses over 100 MPa · m1 / 2 . As with any material , the macroscopic geometry of a diamond contributes to its resistance to breakage . Diamond has a cleavage plane and is therefore more fragile in some orientations than others . Diamond cutters use this attribute to cleave some stones , prior to faceting . \" Impact toughness \" is one of the main indexes to measure the quality of synthetic industrial diamonds .",
