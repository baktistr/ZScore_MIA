  "Surviving medieval recipes frequently call for flavoring with a number of sour , tart liquids . Wine , verjuice ( the juice of unripe grapes or fruits ) vinegar and the juices of various fruits , especially those with tart flavors , were almost universal and a hallmark of late medieval cooking . In combination with sweeteners and spices , it produced a distinctive \" pungeant , fruity \" flavor . Equally common , and used to complement the tanginess of these ingredients , were ( sweet ) almonds . They were used in a variety of ways : whole , shelled or unshelled , slivered , ground and , most importantly , processed into almond milk . This last type of non @-@ dairy milk product is probably the single most common ingredient in late medieval cooking and blended the aroma of spices and sour liquids with a mild taste and creamy texture .",

The younger Georges attended school at the Petit Séminaire de Chicoutimi until the age of fourteen , when he left the school to help at his father 's bakery . He played hockey from a young age , participating in informal street hockey matches with others his own age . Vézina partook in these matches in his shoes , and used skates for the first time at age 16 when he joined the local team in Chicoutimi .

  "Macdonald comments that at the start of the 20th century Massenet was in the enviable position of having his works included in every season of the Opéra and the Opéra @-@ Comique , and in opera houses around the world . From 1900 to his death he led a life of steady work and , generally , success . According to his memoirs , he declined a second offer of the directorship of the Conservatoire in 1905 . Apart from composition , his main concern was his home life in the rue de Vaugirard , Paris , and at his country house in Égreville . He was uninterested in Parisian society , and so shunned the limelight that in later life he preferred not to attend his own first nights . He described himself as \" a fireside man , a bourgeois artist \" . The main biographical detail of note of his latter years was his second amitié amoureuse with one of his leading ladies , Lucy Arbell , who created roles in his last operas . Milnes describes Arbell as \" gold @-@ digging \" : her blatant exploitation of the composer 's honourable affections caused his wife considerable distress and even strained Massenet 's devotion ( or infatuation as Milnes characterises it ) . After the composer 's death Arbell pursued his widow and publishers through the law courts , seeking to secure herself a monopoly of the leading roles in several of his late operas .",

  "In 1206 William was in charge of the naval forces in the Cinque Ports and commanded the fleet that invaded Poitou . Whether he accompanied the fleet or stayed in England after it sailed is unclear ; according to two historians – F. W. Brooks and R. W. Powell – it is more likely he stayed . From 1206 until 1215 he was effectively commander of King John 's navy , and helped to develop Portsmouth as a royal dockyard . In 1208 William was put in charge of ensuring that no ships sailed without royal permission . That year he also oversaw the naval preparations made by the Cinque Ports . The purpose of these preparations is unknown ; the Annals of Dunstable ascribe to John a desire to oppress the Cinque Ports . During May 1208 a royal order was issued that William 's deputies in all the seaports should seize any ships in the ports that were from foreign countries , excluding Denmark , Norway and other countries that did not oppose John 's diplomatic efforts . A gap in the governmental records does not allow a detailed view of William 's activities for the next years , until 1212 , when William is shown performing many of the same duties as earlier . He was in charge of repair of some ships and the construction of a large new ship , named the Deulabenit , owned by the king . William was also responsible for impressing privately owned merchant ships into royal service . These ships were used in the naval action of the Battle of Damme at Zwyn in 1213 , when a fleet under William Longespee , the Earl of Salisbury , destroyed a substantial French naval force and sacked the town of Damme .",

  "Dvořák often adapted Bohemian folklore for his compositions , and his previous four symphonic poems were based on actual poems by the Czech poet Karel Jaromír Erben , especially Erben 's collection of ballads Kytice . A Hero 's Song broke away from this pattern of programmatic symphonic works , as Dvořák did not specify a specific accompanying text , and he only roughly outlined its plot in a later letter . The lack of a fixed programme has been hypothesized as a reason for its relative neglect when compared to Dvořák 's other symphonic works . It has also been suggested that the work was intended to be autobiographical , an unusual approach for Dvořák . This was Dvořák 's only symphonic poem that pursued Franz Liszt 's idealized view of the genre , as Dvořák 's other four works were based on eerie subjects not appropriate to Liszt 's conception .",
  "Ceolnoth ( died 870 ) was a medieval English Archbishop of Canterbury . Although later chroniclers stated he had previously held ecclesiastical office in Canterbury , there is no contemporary evidence of this , and his first appearance in history is when he became archbishop in 833 . Ceolnoth faced two problems as archbishop — raids and invasions by the Vikings and a new political situation resulting from a change in overlordship from one kingdom to another during the early part of his archiepiscopate . Ceolnoth attempted to solve both problems by coming to an agreement with his new overlords for protection in 838 . Ceolnoth 's later years in office were marked by more Viking raids and a decline in monastic life in his archbishopric .",

  "By 1573 , Château Gaillard was uninhabited and in a ruinous state , but it was still believed that the castle posed a threat to the local population if it was repaired . Therefore , at the request of the French States @-@ General , King Henry IV ordered the demolition of Château Gaillard in 1599 . Some of the building material was reused by Capuchin monks who were granted permission to use the stone for maintaining their monasteries . In 1611 , the demolition of Château Gaillard came to an end . The site was left as a ruin , and in 1862 was classified as a monument historique . In 1962 , a conference on the contributions of the Normans to medieval military architecture was held at Les Andelys . Allen Brown attended the conference and remarked that the castle was \" in satisfying receipt of skilful care and attention \" . The journal Château Gaillard : Études de Castellogie Médiévale , which was published as a result of the conference , has since run to 23 volumes , based on international conferences on the subject of castles . In the 1990s , archaeological excavations were carried out at Château Gaillard . The excavations investigated the north of the fortress , searching for an entrance postulated by architect Eugène Viollet @-@ le @-@ Duc , but no such entrance was found . However , the excavation did reveal was that there was an addition to the north of the castle to enable the use of guns . Typologically , the structure has been dated to the 16th century . The conclusion of the excavations was that the site had \" enormous archaeological potential \" , but that there were still unanswered questions about the castle . After Philip II took Chateau Gaillard , he repaired the collapsed tower of the outer bailey that had been used to gain access to the castle . The archaeological investigation examined the tower generally thought to be the one collapsed by Philip , and although it did not recover any dating evidence , the consensus is that he completely rebuilt the tower . In conjunction with the archaeological work , efforts were made to preserve the remaining structures . Today , Château Gaillard 's inner bailey is open to the public from March to November , while the outer baileys are open all year round .",

The broad caudal fin comprises about a fifth of the total body length and has a strong notch near the tip of the upper lobe and an indistinct lower lobe . The skin is thick and covered by well @-@ calcified arrowhead @-@ shaped dermal denticles . The coloration of the dark shyshark is highly variable , and particular individuals can resemble any of the other shyshark species . The background color ranges from light brown to reddish to grayish to almost black above , transitioning abruptly to white or cream below , sometimes with dark blotches beneath the paired fins . There may be 6 – 8 orange , brown , or blackish variably shaped saddles along the back and tail , edged more or less obviously in black . There may also be white spots within or within and between the saddles .",

  "The cookiecutter shark regularly replaces its teeth like other sharks , but sheds its lower teeth in entire rows rather than one at a time . A cookiecutter shark 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) long has been calculated to have shed 15 sets of lower teeth by the time it is 50 cm ( 20 in ) long , totaling 435 – 465 teeth . This represents a significant investment of resources and is probably why the shark swallows its old sets of teeth , so that it can recycle the calcium content . Unlike other sharks , the retina of the cookiecutter shark has ganglion cells concentrated in a concentric area rather than in a horizontal streak across the visual field ; this may help to focus on prey in front of the shark . This fat shark has been known to travel in schools , which may increase the effectiveness of its lure ( see below ) , as well as discourage counterattacks by much larger predators .",
  "During the advance on Finschhafen , a company from the 2 / 17th Battalion , which had been tasked with securing the beachhead and the flank , had been sent to Sattelberg but had been unable to occupy it due to the strength of the Japanese force already there . As captured orders had revealed Japanese plans to breakthrough to the coast , it was decided to place the company into a blocking position east of Sattelberg along the coast road around Jivevaneng . In this position , from 25 September onwards they were subjected to a number of attacks as they attempted to deflect attacks by the Japanese 3rd Battalion , 80th Infantry Regiment , which were aimed at breaking through to Heldsbach Plantation , directly south of the beachhead at Siki Cove . On 30 September the 2 / 17th were replaced by a company from the 2 / 43rd Battalion , and over the next couple of days , a whole battalion of Japanese surrounded the position and attacked it eight times . Four attempts by the Australians to relieve the company failed , before an attack on Kumawa by the 2 / 17th Battalion on 5 October cut the Japanese supply lines and provoked a strong counterattack , which subsequently drew pressure off the beleaguered company , and enabled it to be relieved on 7 October . As the threat of Japanese counterattack grew , the 24th Brigade landed at Langemak Bay on 10 October to reinforce the 20th Brigade . The following day , Wootten was able to establish his divisional headquarters at Finschhafen , and preparations began for the Australians to attack the Japanese force around Sattelberg .",
  "When Cunard died in 1865 , the equally conservative Charles MacIver assumed Cunard 's role . The firm retained its reluctance about change and was overtaken by competitors that more quickly adopted new technology . In 1866 Inman started to build screw propelled express liners that matched Cunard 's premier unit , the Scotia . Cunard responded with its first high speed screw propellered steamer , Russia which was followed by two larger editions . In 1871 both companies faced a new rival when the White Star Line commissioned the Oceanic and her five sisters . The new White Star record @-@ breakers were especially economical because of their use of compound engines . White Star also set new standards for comfort by placing the dining saloon midships and doubling the size of cabins . Inman rebuilt its express fleet to the new standard , but Cunard lagged behind both of its rivals . Throughout the 1870s Cunard passage times were longer than either White Star or Inman .",
  "McCarthy 's judicial career attracted some controversy because of the speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited . Wisconsin had strict divorce laws , but when McCarthy heard divorce cases , he would expedite them whenever possible , and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority . When it came to other cases argued before him , McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon , precise briefs from the contesting attorneys . The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard , but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost evidence in a price fixing case .",

  "On behalf of Somersett , it was argued that while colonial laws might permit slavery , neither the common law of England , nor any law made by Parliament recognised the existence of slavery , and slavery was therefore illegal . Moreover , English contract law did not allow for any person to enslave himself , nor could any contract be binding without the person 's consent . The arguments thus focused on legal details rather than humanitarian principles . A law passed in 1765 said that all lands , forts and slaves owned by the Africa Company were a property of the Crown , which could be interpreted to mean that the Crown accepted slavery . When the two lawyers for Charles Stewart put their case , they argued that a contract for the sale of a slave was recognised in England , and therefore the existence of slaves must be legally valid .",

  "Historically , there have been cyclical ice ages in which glacial sheets periodically covered the higher latitudes of the continents . Ice ages may occur because of changes in ocean circulation and continentality induced by plate tectonics . The Milankovitch theory predicts that glacial periods occur during ice ages because of astronomical factors in combination with climate feedback mechanisms . The primary astronomical drivers are a higher than normal orbital eccentricity , a low axial tilt ( or obliquity ) , and the alignment of summer solstice with the aphelion . Each of these effects occur cyclically . For example , the eccentricity changes over time cycles of about 100 @,@ 000 and 400 @,@ 000 years , with the value ranging from less than 0 @.@ 01 up to 0 @.@ 05 .

  "The morphology of the cheetah differs notably from the other big cats . The face and the jaw are unusually shortened and the sagittal crest is poorly developed , possibly to reduce weight and enhance speed . In fact , the skull resembles that of the smaller cats . Another point of similarity to the small cats is the long and flexible spine , in contrast to the stiff and short one of other large felids . A 2001 study of felid morphology stated that the truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in the cheetah at a relatively younger age than other felids could be a major reason for the peculiar morphology of the cheetah .

As a young child , Michell had been an admirer of Austen 's , which set him apart from his male classmates . \" I was the only boy in my class who took Austen as a special paper \" , he said .

Therefore , there was a proposal to convert Gordon into a small middle school for Bellaire . The school would have space for about 500 students and would be at least 50 % White , so it was popular among many Bellaire residents , particularly those outside of the 610 Loop . However those inside the 610 Loop did not want to lose access to Pershing , a full service middle school that was about 40 % White . An attendance boundary committee for at HISD met from December 1992 to March 1993 . McAdams wrote that the committee was \" an all @-@ out war \" between the two sides . In February 1993 pro @-@ Gordon persons argued that HISD should purchase a commercial building north of Long and renovate it into an elementary school which would relieve Gordon Elementary and other overcrowded are schools . McAdams wrote that the staff members of HISD superintendent Frank Petruzielo \" liked the idea , but unfortunately , on close examination the building proved to be inadequate . \" In April 1993 the HISD board declared that the Gordon campus would continue to be an elementary school .

  "On making landfall , the storm generated high winds at the Fowey Rocks Light , although they were below hurricane force .

Unusually little rain fell in association with the storm ; 0 @.@ 35 inches ( 8 @.@ 9 mm ) of precipitation was reported in Miami , while locations closer to the center of the cyclone received less than 1 inch ( 25 mm ) . The light rainfall was evident throughout southeastern Florida , except for the Florida Keys , where thunderstorms enhanced the precipitation . This aspect of the storm was considered highly unusual , as most tropical cyclones are characterized by heavy rainfall . According to one study , the unusual precipitation patterns can be attributed to one of two possible conditions : \" the air might have been too dry \" , or \" the horizontal convergence of air might have been insufficient to produce a large enough transport of moisture upwards \" . The intense winds blew salt water several miles inland ; due to the lack of rainfall , the salt burned vegetation throughout the region . The high winds brought down trees and utility poles and shattered some windows in Dade County .",

  "Without a steady income , his financial situation began to deteriorate . He began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines , including Scribner 's Monthly , but was informed that although he showed promise , his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications . Locally , he was still dealing with the stigma of the Poe plot . The Indianapolis Journal and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry , leaving Riley desperate for income . In January 1878 on the advice of a friend , Riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry readings . In exchange , he received a portion of the profit his performances earned . Such circuits were popular at the time , and Riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings .",

  "Umbriel 's surface is the darkest of the Uranian moons , and reflects less than half as much light as Ariel , a sister satellite of similar size . Umbriel has a very low Bond albedo of only about 10 % as compared to 23 % for Ariel . The reflectivity of the moon 's surface decreases from 26 % at a phase angle of 0 ° ( geometric albedo ) to 19 % at an angle of about 1 ° . This phenomenon is called opposition surge . The surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color , while fresh bright impact deposits ( in Wunda crater , for instance ) are even bluer . There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres ; the former appears to be redder than the latter . The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering from bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System . However , the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system , possibly , from irregular satellites , which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere . The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous — it does not demonstrate strong variation in either albedo or color .",

Roosevelt was anxious to dump Vice President Wallace from the ticket in the president 's bid for a fourth term , and had an intermediary sound out Willkie about running in Wallace 's place . Willkie was reluctant even to respond , knowing Roosevelt had made promises to potential running mates he did not follow through on . There were further discussions between Willkie and the White House , of which third parties were aware though the details are not known ; the vice presidential nomination went to Harry S Truman . Willkie interested Roosevelt in a new liberal party to be formed once peace came that would combine the left of the two existing major parties , but Willkie broke off contact with the White House after there were leaks of this to the press , as he felt that Roosevelt had used him for political gain .

  "From the late 1960s onward , many of the Yale School of critics describe the poem as a reworking of John Milton 's poetic diction , but they argued that poem revealed that Keats lacked the ability of Milton as a poet . The critics , Harold Bloom ( 1965 ) , Leslie Brisman ( 1973 ) , Paul Fry ( 1980 ) , John Hollander ( 1981 ) and Cynthia Chase ( 1985 ) , all focused on the poem with Milton as a progenitor to \" Ode to a Nightingale \" while ignoring other possibilities , including Shakespeare who was emphasised as being the source of many of Keats 's phrases . Responding to the claims about Milton and Keats 's shortcomings , critics like R. S. White ( 1981 ) and Willard Spiegelman ( 1983 ) used the Shakespearean echoes to argue for a multiplicity of sources for the poem to claim that Keats was not trying to respond just Milton or escape from his shadow . Instead , \" Ode to a Nightingale \" was an original poem , as White claimed , \" The poem is richly saturated in Shakespeare , yet the assimilations are so profound that the Ode is finally original , and wholly Keatsian \" . Similarly , Spiegelman claimed that Shakespeare 's A Midsummer Night 's Dream had \" flavored and ripened the later poem \" . This was followed in 1986 by Jonathan Bate claiming that Keats was \" left enriched by the voice of Shakespeare , the ' immortal bird ' \" .",

  "Quantum evolution was a controversial hypothesis advanced by Columbia University paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson , who was regarded by Stephen Jay Gould as \" the greatest and most biologically astute paleontologist of the twentieth century . \" Simpson 's conjecture was that according to the geological record , on very rare occasions evolution would proceed very rapidly to form entirely new families , orders , and classes of organisms . This hypothesis differs from punctuated equilibrium in several respects . First , punctuated equilibrium was more modest in scope , in that it was addressing evolution specifically at the species level . Simpson 's idea was principally concerned with evolution at higher taxonomic groups . Second , Eldredge and Gould relied upon a different mechanism . Where Simpson relied upon a synergistic interaction between genetic drift and a shift in the adaptive fitness landscape , Eldredge and Gould relied upon ordinary speciation , particularly Ernst Mayr 's concept of allopatric speciation . Lastly , and perhaps most significantly , quantum evolution took no position on the issue of stasis . Although Simpson acknowledged the existence of stasis in what he called the bradytelic mode , he considered it ( along with rapid evolution ) to be unimportant in the larger scope of evolution . In his Major Features of Evolution Simpson stated , \" Evolutionary change is so nearly the universal rule that a state of motion is , figuratively , normal in evolving populations . The state of rest , as in bradytely , is the exception and it seems that some restraint or force must be required to maintain it . \" Despite such differences between the two models , earlier critiques — from such eminent commentators as Sewall Wright as well as Simpson himself — have argued that punctuated equilibrium is little more than quantum evolution relabeled .",

One case of serotonin syndrome has been reported , where the patient was already prescribed fluoxetine and olanzapine , and then took 40 tablets containing mephedrone in one night . He was treated with lorazepam and discharged 15 hours after admission . Both enantiomers of methcathinone , which differs only in the lack of the methyl group on the aryl ring when compared to mephedrone , have been shown to be toxic to rat dopamine neurons , and the S @-@ enantiomer was also toxic against serotonin neurons . Simon Gibbons and Mire Zloh of the School of Pharmacy , University of London stated , based on the chemical similarities between methcathinone and mephedrone , \" it is highly likely that mephedrone will display neurotoxicity \" . However , Brunt and colleagues stated , \" extreme caution \" should be used when inferring the toxicity of mephedrone from methcathinone , noting some of the toxicity associated with methcathinone is due to manganese impurities related to its synthesis , rather than the compound itself . They concluded more experimental research is needed to investigate the toxicity of mephedrone .",

  "Theodotus ' success was not to be completed , however as in early summer 830 , a fleet from the Umayyad Emirate of Córdoba in al @-@ Andalus , under Asbagh ibn Wakil , arrived in Sicily despite the political difference and rivalry between Abbasid Caliphate and the Umayyad Emirate of Cordoba , the latter sent military assistance for Aghlabids to conquer Sicily although the Aghlabids was clearly serving under Abbasid interest . Ibn Kathir recorded that 300 ships of Umayyad and Aghlabids joint forces were present . Theodotus did not confront them , hoping that they would depart after raiding , but the beleaguered garrison at Mineo managed to get into contact with the raiders and proposed joint action . The Andalusians agreed , provided that Asbagh was recognized as the overall commander , and together with fresh troops from Ifriqiya marched on Mineo . Unable to confront them , Theodotus retreated to Enna and the siege of Mineo was broken ( July or August 830 ) . The combined Ifriqiyan and Andalusian army then torched Mineo and laid siege to another town , possibly Calloniana ( modern Barrafranca ) . However , once again a plague broke out in their camp , killing Asbagh and many others . The town fell later , in autumn , but the Arabs ' numbers were so depleted that they had to abandon it and retreat west . Theodotus launched a pursuit and inflicted heavy casualties , so that most of the Andalusians departed the island . However , Theodotus too was killed at this time , possibly in one of these skirmishes .",

  "Endoparasites known to infect wolves include protozoans and helminths ( flukes , tapeworms , roundworms and thorny @-@ headed worms ) . Of 30 @,@ 000 protozoan species , only a few have been recorded to infect wolves : Isospora , Toxoplasma , Sarcocystis , Babesia , and Giardia . Wolves may carry Neospora caninum , which is of particular concern to farmers , as the disease can be spread to livestock , with infected animals being 3 – 13 times more likely to miscarry than those not infected . Among flukes , the most common in North American wolves is Alaria , which infects small rodents and amphibians that are eaten by wolves . Upon reaching maturity , Alaria migrates to the wolf 's intestine , but harms it little . Metorchis conjunctus , which enters wolves through eating fish , infects the wolf 's liver or gall bladder , causing liver disease , inflammation of the pancreas , and emaciation . Most other fluke species reside in the wolf 's intestine , though Paragonimus westermani lives in the lungs . Tapeworms are commonly found in wolves , as their primary hosts are ungulates , small mammals , and fish , which wolves feed upon . Tapeworms generally cause little harm in wolves , though this depends on the number and size of the parasites , and the sensitivity of the host . Symptoms often include constipation , toxic and allergic reactions , irritation of the intestinal mucosa , and malnutrition . Infections by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus in ungulate populations tend to increase in areas with high wolf densities , as wolves can shed Echinoccocus eggs in their feces onto grazing areas . Wolves can carry over 30 roundworm species , though most roundworm infections appear benign , depending on the number of worms and the age of the host . Ancylostoma caninum attaches itself on the intestinal wall to feed on the host 's blood , and can cause hyperchromic anemia , emaciation , diarrhea , and possibly death . Toxocara canis , a hookworm known to infect wolf pups in utero , can cause intestinal irritation , bloating , vomiting , and diarrhea . Wolves may catch Dioctophyma renale from minks , which infects the kidneys , and can grow to lengths of 100 cm . D. renale causes the complete destruction of the kidney 's functional tissue , and can be fatal if both kidneys are infected . Wolves can tolerate low levels of Dirofilaria immitis for many years without showing any ill effects , though high levels can kill wolves through cardiac enlargement and congestive hepatopathy . Wolves probably become infected with Trichinella spiralis by eating infected ungulates . Although T. spiralis isn 't known to produce clinical signs in wolves , it can cause emaciation , salivation , and crippling muscle pains in dogs . Thorny @-@ headed worms rarely infect wolves , though three species have been identified in Russian wolves : Nicolla skrjabini , Macrocantorhynchus catulinus , and Moniliformis moniliformis .",

  "Thomas Charles @-@ Edwards has suggested that the kingdom of Dál Riata was a cross @-@ roads between the artistic styles of the Picts and those of Ireland , with which the Scots settlers in what is now Argyll kept close contacts . This can be seen in representations found in excavations of the fortress of Dunadd , which combine Pictish and Irish elements . This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the Hunterston brooch , found in Ayrshire , which may have been made in Dál Riata , but with elements that suggest Irish origins .

  "Performances of Mahler 's works became less frequent after his death . In the Netherlands the advocacy of Willem Mengelberg ensured that Mahler remained popular there , and Mengelberg 's engagement with the New York Philharmonic from 1922 to 1928 brought Mahler regularly to American audiences . However , much American critical reaction in the 1920s was negative , despite a spirited effort by the young composer Aaron Copland to present Mahler as a progressive , 30 years ahead of his time and infinitely more inventive than Richard Strauss . Earlier , in 1916 , Leopold Stokowski had given the American premieres of the Eighth Symphony and Das Lied von der Erde in Philadelphia . The Eighth was a sensationally successful performance that was immediately taken to New York where it scored a further triumph . In Britain the Hallé Orchestra brought Das Lied and the Ninth Symphony to Manchester in 1931 ; Sir Henry Wood staged the Eighth in London in 1930 , and again in 1938 when the young Benjamin Britten found the performance \" execrable \" but was nevertheless impressed by the music . British critics during this period largely treated Mahler with condescension and faint praise . Thus Dyneley Hussey , writing in 1934 , thought the \" children 's songs \" were delightful , but that the symphonies should be let go . Composer @-@ conductor Julius Harrison described Mahler 's symphonies as \" interesting at times , but laboriously put together \" and as lacking creative spark . Bernard Shaw , in his role as music critic , thought that the musical audiences of the 1930s would find Mahler ( and Bruckner ) \" expensively second @-@ rate \" .",
  "The Rights of Woman is an extension of Wollstonecraft 's arguments in the Rights of Men . In the Rights of Men , as the title suggests , she is concerned with the rights of particular men ( 18th @-@ century British men ) while in the Rights of Woman , she is concerned with the rights afforded to \" woman \" , an abstract category . She does not isolate her argument to 18th @-@ century women or British women . The first chapter of the Rights of Woman addresses the issue of natural rights and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds . She answers that since natural rights are given by God , for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin . The Rights of Woman thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau .",

  "The original Great Western Main Line linked London Paddington station with Temple Meads station in Bristol by way of Reading , Didcot , Swindon , Chippenham and Bath . This line was extended westwards through Exeter and Plymouth to reach Truro and Penzance , the most westerly railway station in England . Brunel and Gooch placed the GWR 's main locomotive workshops close to the village of Swindon and the locomotives of many trains were changed here in the early years . Up to this point the route had climbed very gradually westwards from London , but from here it changed into one with steeper gradients which , with the primitive locomotives available to Brunel , was better operated by types with smaller wheels better able to climb the hills . These gradients faced both directions , first dropping down through Wootton Bassett to cross the River Avon , then climbing back up through Chippenham to the Box Tunnel before descending once more to regain the River Avon 's valley which it followed to Bath and Bristol .",

They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra @-@ Pennant Measures . They are frequently waterlogged where the topography dictates . They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour .

In the eastern area of the valley as the River Chew flows through Publow , Woollard and Compton Dando before joining the River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils .",

The following year , Henry disinherited the sisters of Isabelle of Gloucester , contrary to legal custom , and betrothed John to the now extremely wealthy Isabelle .

  "The Black Act ( 9 Geo . 1 c . 22 ) was an Act of the Parliament of Great Britain passed in 1723 in response to a series of raids by two groups of poachers , known as the Blacks . Arising in the aftermath of the South Sea Bubble 's collapse and the ensuing economic downturn , the Blacks gained their name from their habit of blacking their faces when undertaking poaching raids . They quickly demonstrated both \" a calculated programme of action , and a conscious social resentment \" , and their activities led to the introduction of the Black Act to Parliament on 26 April 1723 ; it came into force on 27 May . The Act introduced the death penalty for over 50 criminal offences , including being found in a forest while disguised , and \" no other single statute passed during the eighteenth century equalled [ the Black Act ] in severity , and none appointed the punishment of death in so many cases \" . Following a criminal law reform campaign in the early 19th century , it was largely repealed on 8 July 1823 , when a reform bill introduced by Robert Peel came into force .",

  "Laying starts at the end of April into early May . The eggs are whitish with very indistinct buff , grey or brown markings at the broad end . The eggs are 14 mm × 10 mm ( 0 @.@ 55 in × 0 @.@ 39 in ) and weigh 0 @.@ 8 g ( 0 @.@ 028 oz ) , of which 5 % is shell . The clutch size in Europe is typically 9 – 11 eggs , but ranges from 6 – 13 . The eggs are piled up in the nest and the female keeps the eggs warm with her brood patch and also by putting her warm legs into the middle of the pile between the eggs . Within a clutch the size of eggs increases gradually and the last laid egg may be 20 % larger than the first egg . Second clutches , which are common , are laid usually while the first nest still has young . The male builds the second nest , then feeds the young in the first nest while the female is incubating in the second ; when the first brood has fledged , he joins the female in feeding the second brood . The female goldcrest is not normally fed by her mate while incubating . She is a tight sitter , reluctant to leave the nest when disturbed , and has been recorded as continuing to attend the nest when it has been moved , or even when it is being held . The eggs are maintained at 36 @.@ 5 ° C ( 97 @.@ 7 ° F ) , the female regulating the temperature of the eggs by varying the time spent sitting . She leaves the nest more with increasing air temperature , and incubates more tightly when the light intensity is lower early and late in the day . The female incubates the eggs for 16 to 19 days to hatching , and broods the chicks , which fledge in a further 17 to 22 days later . Both parents feed the chicks and fledged young , and in very hot weather , the female has been noted as taking drops of water to her chicks in her bill . This species becomes sexually mature after one year , and has an annual adult mortality of over 80 percent giving a life expectancy of around eight months , which is the shortest for any bird apart from a few Coturnix species .

  "It is thought that global dimming is probably due to the increased presence of aerosol particles in the atmosphere caused by human action . Aerosols and other particulates absorb solar energy and reflect sunlight back into space . The pollutants can also become nuclei for cloud droplets . Water droplets in clouds coalesce around the particles . Increased pollution causes more particulates and thereby creates clouds consisting of a greater number of smaller droplets ( that is , the same amount of water is spread over more droplets ) . The smaller droplets make clouds more reflective , so that more incoming sunlight is reflected back into space and less reaches the Earth 's surface . This same effect also reflects radiation from below , trapping it in the lower atmosphere . In models , these smaller droplets also decrease rainfall .",

By 1897 , 96 members of the NWMP had been sent to the district and by 1898 this had increased to 288 , an expensive commitment by the Canadian government . By June 1898 the force was headed by Colonel Sam Steele , an officer with a reputation for firm discipline . In 1898 , there were no murders and only a few major thefts ; in all , only about 150 arrests were made in the Yukon for serious offenses that year . Of these arrests , over half were for prostitution and resulted from an attempt by the NWMP to regulate the sex industry in Dawson : regular monthly arrests , $ 50 ( $ 1 @,@ 400 ) fines and medical inspections were imposed , with the proceeds being used to fund the local hospitals .

Erwin van der Borght , the organization 's Africa director , wrote in a statement : \" Joseph Kony and other LRA leaders have evaded arrest for far too long and this campaign is a salient reminder of the continuing crimes by LRA members and the need to arrest and surrender their leaders to the ICC so they can face trial , \" but added : \" Anyone joining the Kony 2012 campaign should insist that efforts to arrest Joseph Kony must respect human rights \" , especially because \" many of LRA members were themselves victims of human rights violations including forcible recruitment \" , and ensure the protection of civilians .",
  "Many of the rural ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing influence of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement . The ranchers largely maintained control of the country outside Tombstone , due in large part to the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan , who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers , and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps . Behan tended to ignore the Earps ' complaints about the McLaurys ' and Clantons ' horse thieving and cattle rustling . As officers of the law , the Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when it affected their gambling and saloon interests , which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction .",
  "Although Moodu Pani is officially based on the novel Idhuvum Oru Viduthalai Thaan , it has frequently been described as also having been inspired by Alfred Hitchcock 's thriller Psycho ( 1960 ) .

  "Another form of wife selling was by deed of conveyance . Although initially much less common than sale by auction , the practice became more widespread after the 1850s , as popular opinion turned against the market sale of a wife . The issue of the commonly perceived legitimacy of wife selling was also brought to the government . In 1881 , Home Secretary William Harcourt was asked to comment on an incident in Sheffield , in which a man sold his wife for a quart of beer . Harcourt replied : \" no impression exists anywhere in England that the selling of wives is legitimate \" , and \" that no such practice as wife selling exists \" , but as late as 1889 , a member of the Salvation Army sold his wife for a shilling in Hucknall Torkard , Nottinghamshire , and subsequently led her by the halter to her buyer 's house , the last case in which the use of a halter is mentioned .

  "Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud formed when water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine condenses on particles , which come from either the surrounding air or the exhaust itself , and freezes , leaving behind a visible trail . The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei when there is an insufficient naturally @-@ occurring supply in the atmosphere . One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can form into large mats of cirrus , and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth 's atmosphere .",

During the last months of 1942 the unit received 18 C @-@ 4 variants of the Fw 200 which were fitted with the Lotfe 7D bombsight . This sight reduced the Condors ' vulnerability to anti @-@ aircraft fire by allowing them to bomb targets from medium altitudes ; previously they had only been able to attack accurately from low levels .

  "Mycology is a relatively new science that became systematic after the development of the microscope in the 16th century . Although fungal spores were first observed by Giambattista della Porta in 1588 , the seminal work in the development of mycology is considered to be the publication of Pier Antonio Micheli 's 1729 work Nova plantarum genera . Micheli not only observed spores but also showed that , under the proper conditions , they could be induced into growing into the same species of fungi from which they originated . Extending the use of the binomial system of nomenclature introduced by Carl Linnaeus in his Species plantarum ( 1753 ) , the Dutch Christian Hendrik Persoon ( 1761 – 1836 ) established the first classification of mushrooms with such skill so as to be considered a founder of modern mycology . Later , Elias Magnus Fries ( 1794 – 1878 ) further elaborated the classification of fungi , using spore color and various microscopic characteristics , methods still used by taxonomists today . Other notable early contributors to mycology in the 17th – 19th and early 20th centuries include Miles Joseph Berkeley , August Carl Joseph Corda , Anton de Bary , the brothers Louis René and Charles Tulasne , Arthur H. R. Buller , Curtis G. Lloyd , and Pier Andrea Saccardo .

The Bf 109s were not permitted to leave the bombers and chase enemy fighters . Time and again , they were forced to break off and return to the bomber stream , allowing the RAF fighters to return and repeat the process . Soon after , No. 605 and No. 501 Squadron arrived with 14 Hurricanes . One fighter was hit by return fire , but the pilot aimed his aircraft at a Dornier and bailed out . The fighter collided and destroyed the bomber . The German bomber crews had no way of knowing that the crashes were not premeditated . It seemed as if the British were desperate . Nevertheless , they thought the ' tactic ' was devastatingly effective . Chastened by losses , the Dorniers closed ranks to snuff out the gaps and continued to their target .",

  "The Greeks of the classical period believed that , in the dark age that followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization , significant numbers of Greeks fled and had emigrated to Asia Minor and settled there . Modern historians generally accept this migration as historic ( but separate from the later colonization of the Mediterranean by the Greeks ) . There are , however , those who believe the Ionian migration cannot be explained as simply as the classical Greeks claimed . These settlers were from three tribal groups : the Aeolians , Dorians and Ionians . The Ionians had settled about the coasts of Lydia and Caria , founding the twelve cities that made up Ionia . These cities were Miletus , Myus and Priene in Caria ; Ephesus , Colophon , Lebedos , Teos , Clazomenae , Phocaea and Erythrae in Lydia ; and the islands of Samos and Chios . Although the Ionian cities were independent of one another , they recognized their shared heritage and supposedly had a common temple and meeting place , the Panionion . They thus formed a ' cultural league ' , to which they would admit no other cities , or even other tribal Ionians .",

  "In social theory , twentieth- and twenty @-@ first @-@ century thinkers have pursued two main strategies in response to Marx . One move has been to reduce it to its analytical core , known as Analytical Marxism , which came at the cost of sacrificing its most interesting and perplexing ideas . Another , more common move has been to dilute the explanatory claims of Marx 's social theory and to emphasise the \" relative autonomy \" of aspects of social and economic life not directly related to Marx 's central narrative of interaction between the development of the \" forces of production \" and the succession of \" modes of production \" . Such has been , for example , the neo @-@ marxist theorising adopted by historians inspired by Marx 's social theory , such as E. P. Thompson and Eric Hobsbawm . It has also been a line of thinking pursued by thinkers and activists like Antonio Gramsci who have sought to understand the opportunities and the difficulties of transformative political practice , seen in the light of Marxist social theory .

  "Following the race the ACO and the Fédération Française du Sport Automobile ( FFSA ) national motorsport body investigated the incidents . The FFSA questioned the ACO 's decision to allow Mercedes to continue to compete after the two accidents prior to the race start , but the ACO argued that there were no indications that the problems that befell CLR No. 4 were shared by the other Mercedes entries . The ACO argued that the design of the CLR , with the longest front and rear overhang amongst the prototype field , was the cause of the problem . A Porsche 911 GT1 , similar in design to the CLR , had suffered a nearly identical accident the year before at Road Atlanta in the United States .

  "The design of the fort was a pentagon shape that fitted conveniently into the point of the bluff above the cliff . The ditch , tunnels and underground chambers had to be cut out of solid stone and faced with masonry . Several loopholes and firing ports were fitted into the stone encasements to allow rifle fire from every aspect of the fort . In case of an attempted infantry assault , caponiers faced both landward sides of the fort , with firing positions facing each direction . This meant that the only position to safely assault the fort with infantry was up the sheer cliffs of Kangaroo Bluff . Access to the caponiers was through iron hatchways that opened into open passageways three metres deep . These in turn led to tunnels accessing underground magazines , stores , a lamp room , well and the loading galleries . The loading galleries were ingenious and allowed the guns to be muzzle loaded with shells dragged along a conveyor belt directly to the muzzle of the gun , when it was in a downward tilted position .",

  "Early medieval historian Movses Khorenatsi attributed the inscription to Tiridates III . Most scholars now attribute the inscription to Tiridates I. Considering that the inscription says the temple was built in the eleventh year of reign of Tiridates I , the temple is believed to have been completed in 77 AD . This date was proposed by Alexander Sahinian and has since gained general acceptance in Armenia . The date is primarily linked to the visit of Tiridates I to Rome in 66 AD , where he was crowned by Roman emperor Nero . To rebuilt the city of Artaxata ( Artashat ) , destroyed by the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo , Nero gave Tiridates 50 million drachmas and provided him with Roman craftsmen . Upon his return to Armenia Tiridates began a major project of reconstruction , which included rebuilding the fortified city of Garni . It is during this period that the temple is thought to have been built . The temple is believed to have been dedicated to Mihr , the sun god in the Zoroastrian @-@ influenced Armenian mythology and the equivalent of Mithra . Tiridates , like other Armenian monarchs , considered Mihr their patron . Some scholars have argued that the historical context during which the temple was built , i.e. after returning from Rome as king , it is natural that Tiridates dedicated the temple to his patron god .

In contrast to the other guard @-@ oriented teams of the Western Conference , the Rockets had a high rotation on the position – John Lucas left the team 65 games into the season , Allen Leavell replaced him for twelve games before breaking his wrist , and Robert Reid took over as the starter from the final game of the regular season on . During the playoffs , the Rockets swept the Sacramento Kings before a hard @-@ fought series with Alex English 's Denver Nuggets , including one game going to double overtime in the exhausting altitude of the Mile @-@ High City . The young squad grinded it out and eventually pulled away with the victory over the Nuggets 4 – 2 . When faced with defending champion Lakers in the Conference Finals , the Rockets were ready to knock off their rivals who had the best of them during the regular season . The Rockets , however , were blown out of Game 1 with Olajuwon 's spinning reverse dunks and Sampson 's alley @-@ oops notwithstanding . Embarrassed by the loss , Olajuwon and the Rockets stormed back to shock the star @-@ studded defending champions with 4 straight wins in an impressive four games to one series victory , a feat that no other Western Conference team had come close to doing against the Showtime Lakers . Sampson 's buzzer beater that won Game 5 was described by him as \" the greatest moment of my basketball career \" . The Rockets competed in the finals for only the second time in team history , once again facing the Celtics . Boston sportswriters were not happy about not getting a shot at revenge against the Lakers who had beaten the Celtics in the Finals the year before , yet the matchup was interesting with the young front court challenging the playoff @-@ hardened Celtics front court of Bird , McHale and Parish . The Celtics won the first two games at the Boston Garden , only for the Rockets to win two games once the series went back to Houston – a close game 3 under Sampson 's leadership , and a 15 point @-@ leading game 5 without him as he got ejected – while also losing game 4 due to late Larry Bird 3 pointers and untimely turnovers by Rockets guard Mitch Wiggins . Game 6 went back to Boston with Sampson finding himself again in foul trouble and of little effect against the older and wiser Celtics . After the series , Boston coach KC Jones called the Rockets , \" the new monsters on the block \" with the future looking very bright for the Rockets . During the six @-@ game championship series loss against the Celtics , Sampson averaged 14 @.@ 8 points on .438 shooting , 9 @.@ 5 rebounds and 3 @.@ 3 assists per game .",

  "During the first two centuries of its existence , the Roman Republic expanded through a combination of conquest and alliance , from central Italy to the entire Italian peninsula . By the following century , it included North Africa , Spain , and what is now southern France . Two centuries after that , towards the end of the 1st century BC , it included the rest of modern France , Greece , and much of the eastern Mediterranean . By this time , internal tensions led to a series of civil wars , culminating with the assassination of Julius Caesar , which led to the transition from republic to empire . The exact date of transition can be a matter of interpretation . Historians have variously proposed Julius Caesar 's crossing of the Rubicon River in 49 BC , Caesar 's appointment as dictator for life in 44 BC , and the defeat of Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC . However , most use the same date as did the ancient Romans themselves , the Roman Senate 's grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian and his adopting the title Augustus in 27 BC , as the defining event ending the Republic .",

  "Although these natural calamities and rebellions stained the reputation and hampered the effectiveness of the central government , the early 9th century is nonetheless viewed as a period of recovery for the Tang dynasty . The government 's withdrawal from its role in managing the economy had the unintended effect of stimulating trade , as more markets with less bureaucratic restrictions were opened up . By 780 , the old grain tax and labor service of the 7th century was replaced by a semiannual tax paid in cash , signifying the shift to a money economy boosted by the merchant class . Cities in the Jiangnan region to the south , such as Yangzhou , Suzhou , and Hangzhou prospered the most economically during the late Tang period . The government monopoly on the production of salt , weakened after the An Shi Rebellion , was placed under the Salt Commission , which became one of the most powerful state agencies , run by capable ministers chosen as specialists . The commission began the practice of selling merchants the rights to buy monopoly salt , which they would then transport and sell in local markets . In 799 salt accounted for over half of the government 's revenues . S. A. M. Adshead writes that this salt tax represents \" the first time that an indirect tax , rather than tribute , levies on land or people , or profit from state enterprises such as mines , had been the primary resource of a major state . \" Even after the power of the central government was in decline after the mid 8th century , it was still able to function and give out imperial orders on a massive scale .

He provided a quotation describing the struggle for existence , citing a Spanish translation of this work : \" The rat goes out for its food , and is clever in getting it , for it eats all animals inferior to it in strength , \" and in turn , it \" has to avoid snakes and birds and serpents of prey , who look for it in order to devour it \" and are stronger than the rat . Mosquitoes \" know instinctively that blood is the thing which makes them live \" and when they see an animal , \" they know that the skin has been fashioned to serve them as food . \" In turn , flies hunt the mosquito \" which is the food that they like best , \" and predators eat the flies . \" All animals , in short , can not exist without food , neither can the hunting animal escape being hunted in his turn . Every weak animal devours those weaker than itself . Strong animals cannot escape being devoured by other animals stronger than they . And in this respect , men do not differ from animals , some with respect to others , although they do not arrive at the same extremes .

  "In 2008 Jeffrey Moore ( planetary geologist of Ames Research Center ) proposed an alternate view of Titan 's geology . Noting that no volcanic features had been unambiguously identified on Titan so far , he asserted that Titan is a geologically dead world , whose surface is shaped only by impact cratering , fluvial and eolian erosion , mass wasting and other exogenic processes . According to this hypothesis , methane is not emitted by volcanoes but slowly diffuses out of Titan 's cold and stiff interior . Ganesa Macula may be an eroded impact crater with a dark dune in the center . The mountainous ridges observed in some regions can be explained as heavily degraded scarps of large multi @-@ ring impact structures or as a result of the global contraction due to the slow cooling of the interior . Even in this case , Titan may still have an internal ocean made of the eutectic water – ammonia mixture with a temperature of 176 K ( − 97 ° C ) , which is low enough to be explained by the decay of radioactive elements in the core . The bright Xanadu terrain may be a degraded heavily cratered terrain similar to that observed on the surface of Callisto . Indeed , were it not for its lack of an atmosphere , Callisto could serve as a model for Titan 's geology in this scenario . Jeffrey Moore even called Titan Callisto with weather .",
  "Fruits are released in the summer , containing about 16 seeds on average . These seeds are most typically dispersed by ants , which is called myrmecochory , but yellow jackets ( Vespula vulgaris ) and harvestmen ( order Opiliones ) have both been observed dispersing the seeds at lower frequencies . Insect dispersal is aided by the presence of a conspicuous elaiosome , an oil @-@ rich body attached to the seed , which is high in both lipids and oleic acid . The oleic acid induces corpse @-@ carrying behavior in ants , causing them to bring the seeds to their nesting sites as if they were food . As ants visit several colonies of the plant , they bring genetically variable seeds back to a single location , which after germination results in a new population with relatively high genetic diversity .

  "Sulla , who had observed the violent results of radical populare reforms ( in particular those under Marius and Cinna ) , was naturally conservative , and so his conservatism was more reactionary than it was visionary . As such , he sought to strengthen the aristocracy , and thus the senate . After being appointed Roman Dictator in 82 BC , he enacted a series of constitutional reforms . He resigned the Dictatorship in 80 BC , retired in 79 BC , and died a year later . While he thought that he had firmly established aristocratic rule , his own career had illustrated the fatal weaknesses in the constitution . Ultimately , it was the army , and not the senate , which dictated the fortunes of the state .",

  "Because lionesses hunt in open spaces where they are easily seen by their prey , cooperative hunting increases the likelihood of a successful hunt ; this is especially true with larger species . Teamwork also enables them to defend their kills more easily against other large predators such as hyenas , which may be attracted by vultures from kilometres away in open savannas . Lionesses do most of the hunting ; males attached to prides do not usually participate in hunting , except in the case of larger quarry such as giraffe and buffalo . In typical hunts , each lioness has a favoured position in the group , either stalking prey on the \" wing \" then attacking , or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey in flight from other lionesses . There is evidence that male lions are just as successful at hunting as females ; they are solo hunters who ambush prey in small bush . Young lions first display stalking behaviour around three months of age , although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old . They begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two .",

  "While the BTO is able to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft at the time of each handshake , it was still necessary to determine where along the BTO arcs the aircraft was . To accomplish this , an analysis was performed on another attribute of received signals that was recorded by the ground station : the burst frequency offset ( BFO ) — the difference between the expected and actual frequencies of the signal received from the aircraft . The BFO is primarily caused by the Doppler shift — a shift in frequency caused by the relative movement of the aircraft , satellite , and ground station — along with several other factors which can be calculated and removed , allowing the Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite to be isolated . The Doppler shift between the aircraft and satellite indicates the relative motion of the aircraft relative to the satellite , although multiple combinations of aircraft speed and heading exist that match a given Doppler shift value .",

Marwan first secured his rear by subduing the Armenian factions who were hostile to the Arabs and their client Ashot . He then pushed into Iberia , driving its Chosroid ruler to seek refuge in the fortress of Anakopia on the Black Sea coast , in the Byzantine protectorate of Abkhazia . Marwan laid siege to Anakopia itself , but he was forced to retire due to the outbreak of dysentery among his troops .",
  "Holst 's father , Adolph von Holst , became organist and choirmaster at All Saints ' Church , Cheltenham ; he also taught , and gave piano recitals . His wife , Clara , a former pupil , was a talented singer and pianist . They had two sons ; Gustav 's younger brother , Emil Gottfried , became known as Ernest Cossart , a successful actor in the West End , New York and Hollywood . Clara died in February 1882 , and the family moved to another house in Cheltenham , where Adolph recruited his sister Nina to help raise the boys . Gustav recognised her devotion to the family and dedicated several of his early compositions to her . In 1885 Adolph married Mary Thorley Stone , another of his pupils . They had two sons , Matthias ( known as \" Max \" ) and Evelyn ( \" Thorley \" ) . Mary von Holst was absorbed in theosophy and not greatly interested in domestic matters . All four of Adolph 's sons were subject to what one biographer calls \" benign neglect \" , and Gustav in particular was \" not overburdened with attention or understanding , with a weak sight and a weak chest , both neglected — he was ' miserable and scared ' . \"",

  "Canadian visual art has been dominated by figures such as Tom Thomson – the country 's most famous painter – and by the Group of Seven . Thomson 's career painting Canadian landscapes spanned a decade up to his death in 1917 at age 39 . The Group were painters with a nationalistic and idealistic focus , who first exhibited their distinctive works in May 1920 . Though referred to as having seven members , five artists — Lawren Harris , A. Y. Jackson , Arthur Lismer , J. E. H. MacDonald , and Frederick Varley — were responsible for articulating the Group 's ideas . They were joined briefly by Frank Johnston , and by commercial artist Franklin Carmichael . A. J. Casson became part of the Group in 1926 . Associated with the Group was another prominent Canadian artist , Emily Carr , known for her landscapes and portrayals of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast . Since the 1950s , works of Inuit art have been given as gifts to foreign dignitaries by the Canadian government .",

  "A sequel to God of War was first teased at the end of its credits , which stated , \" Kratos Will Return \" . God of War II was officially announced at the 2006 Game Developers Conference ( GDC ) . David Jaffe stepped down and became the creative director of its sequel and God of War 's lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of game director . Barlog said that in the game , players would see \" a larger view of Kratos ' role within the mythological world . \" Like God of War , the game uses Santa Monica 's Kinetica engine . Magic attacks became an integral part of the combat system and it was more refined . New creatures and heroes from the mythology , and more boss battles were added . Both Jaffe and Barlog said that they did not view God of War II as a sequel , but rather a continuation of the previous game . Jaffe said that they did not want to include the Roman numeral number two ( II ) in the title for this reason , but they did not want the title to convey the impression it was an expansion pack . Both Jaffe and Barlog said that the reason God of War II appeared on the PlayStation 2 instead of the PlayStation 3 — which was released four months prior to God of War II — was because \" there 's a 100 million people out there that will be able to play God of War II as soon as it launches . \" Barlog assured that the game would be playable on the newer platform , which had PlayStation 2 backwards compatibility .",

However , the only known revival of the work came in Venice , in 1640 . Public theatre opera had come to the city in March 1637 , when the new Teatro San Cassiano opened with a performance of L 'Andromeda by Francesco Manelli . The popularity of this and other works led to more theatres converting their facilities for opera ; L 'Arianna was chosen to inaugurate the Teatro San Moisè as an opera house during the 1639 – 40 Carnival ( the precise date of this performance is not recorded ) . A revised version of the libretto had been published in 1639 , with substantial cuts and revisions from the 1608 version to remove passages too specifically linked to the Mantuan wedding . The composer , who was by then 73 years old , had acquired considerable prestige in Venice , having been director of music at St Mark 's Basilica since 1613 . The dedication in the revised and republished libretto describes him as \" [ the ] most celebrated Apollo of the century and the highest intelligence of the heavens of humanity \" . The opera was received with great enthusiasm by a Venetian audience already familiar with the lament , which had been published in the city in 1623 .

If you add lyrics about a girl in the song , the listener doesn 't have a choice of what the song is about , it 's told to them . My musical writings allow me to express anything . It 's easier for me to tell a story of something I 've encountered this way than to verbalize it . And my feelings are explored more in my compositions compared to what I could ever say in a few sentences . \" He believes that \" music allows a person to express their deepest thoughts , thoughts that cannot be expressed with just words . \" He also believes that the spiritual aspect of creating is to \" find something deep within yourself that can only be created by you \" ... \" Your spiritual self cannot be copied and that 's why it 's so significant in life and music \" , he says . Parsons goes on to say , \" The influence of years of touring with Yanni is apparent in the richness of Joseph 's sound , but his musical voice is his own . \" Yanni once said , \" Bradley , your extreme sensitivity is your greatest gift \" .

  "A paradox in metabolism is that , while the vast majority of complex life on Earth requires oxygen for its existence , oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that damages living organisms by producing reactive oxygen species . Consequently , organisms contain a complex network of antioxidant metabolites and enzymes that work together to prevent oxidative damage to cellular components such as DNA , proteins and lipids . In general , antioxidant systems either prevent these reactive species from being formed , or remove them before they can damage vital components of the cell . However , reactive oxygen species also have useful cellular functions , such as redox signaling . Thus , the function of antioxidant systems is not to remove oxidants entirely , but instead to keep them at an optimum level .",

  "The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts .

Masonry channels carried water from distant springs and reservoirs along a precise gradient , using gravity alone . After the water passed through the aqueduct , it was collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains , baths , toilets , or industrial sites . The main aqueducts in the city of Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia . The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120 km away along a sinuous route of more than 336 km .

The other side , known as the \" ditchers \" , favored diverting water from northeast Washington 's Pend Oreille River via a gravity canal to irrigate farmland in Central and Eastern Washington . Many locals such as Woods , O 'Sullivan and Clapp were pumpers , while many influential businessmen in Spokane associated with the Washington Water and Power Company ( WWPC ) were staunch ditchers .

  "The Royal Yugoslav Army ( Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije , VKJ ) was quickly overwhelmed by the combined German , Italian and Hungarian assault . Much of its equipment was obsolete , its military strategy was outdated and its soldiers were ill @-@ disciplined and poorly trained . To make matters worse , many of the VKJ 's Croat personnel refused to fight against the Germans , whom they considered liberators from Serb oppression . This attitude was shared by many soldiers of the 40th Infantry Division Slavonska 's largely Croat 108th Regiment , which was stationed in the village of Veliki Grđevac . The regiment had been mobilised in Bjelovar , and on 7 April was marching towards Virovitica to take up positions , when its Croat members revolted and arrested the Serb officers and soldiers . Led by Captain Ivan Mrak , the regiment disarmed a Yugoslav gendarmerie post in Garešnica and began marching back to Bjelovar alongside a band of Ustaše rebels under Mijo Hans . The following morning , elements of the 108th Regiment entered Bjelovar and clashed with the local gendarmerie , sustaining losses of two killed and three wounded . At about noon , the regiment joined up with elements of the 42nd Infantry Regiment and other units of the 40th Infantry Division . At around the same time , Julije Makanec , the Croat mayor of Bjelovar , joined Ustaše official Ivan Šestak and HSS representative Franjo Hegeduš in demanding that the VKJ surrender the town to the rebels . When the 4th Army 's commander , General Petar Nedeljković , learned of the rebel approach , he ordered the local gendarmerie commander to maintain order , but was advised that this would not be possible as local Croat conscripts would not report for duty . Fourth Army headquarters reported the rebels ' presence to the headquarters of the 1st Army Group , which requested that HSS leader Vladko Maček intervene with the rebels . Maček agreed to send an emissary to the 108th Infantry Regiment urging them to obey their officers , to no avail .",

  "Enhanced by the considerable influence of Leicester 's Commonwealth , the rumours about Amy Robsart 's death developed into a tradition of embellished folklore . As early as 1608 , a domestic tragedy named A Yorkshire Tragedy alluded to her fall from a pair of stairs as an easy way to get rid of one 's wife : \" A politician did it . \" In the 19th century her story became very popular due to the best @-@ selling novel , Kenilworth , by Walter Scott . The novel 's arch @-@ villain is again called Varney . The notion that Amy Robsart was murdered gained new strength with the discovery of the Spanish diplomatic correspondence ( and with it of poison rumours ) by the Victorian historian James Anthony Froude . Generally convinced of Leicester 's wretchedness , he concluded in 1863 : \" she was murdered by persons who hoped to profit by his elevation to the throne ; and Dudley himself … used private means … to prevent the search from being pressed inconveniently far . \" There followed the Norfolk antiquarian Walter Rye with The Murder of Amy Robsart in 1885 : here she was first poisoned and then , that method failing , killed by violent means . Rye 's main sources were Cecil 's talk with de Quadra around the time of Amy Dudley 's death and , again , Leicester 's Commonwealth . Much more scholarly and influential was an 1870 work by George Adlard , Amy Robsart and the Earl of Leycester , which printed relevant letters and covertly suggested suicide as an explanation . By 1910 , A.F.

The Supreme Court overturned portions of an act of Congress which had listed various actions and had said that the performance of any of these actions could be taken as conclusive , irrebuttable proof of intent to give up U.S. citizenship . However , the Court ruled that a person 's intent to give up citizenship could be established through a standard of preponderance of evidence ( i.e. , more likely than not ) — rejecting an argument that intent to relinquish citizenship could only be found on the basis of clear , convincing and unequivocal evidence .",

  "Numerous documented cases of postmortem fetal extrusion were described in the medical compendium Anomalies and Curiosities of Medicine , first published in 1896 . The earliest presented case occurred in 1551 when a pregnant woman was tried and hanged by the courts of the Spanish Inquisition . Four hours after her death , and while the body still hung by the neck , two dead infants were seen to fall free of the body . This is unusual for the short amount of time elapsed between death and the postmortem delivery . As no information is given regarding other ambient circumstances , it is unclear whether the onset of putrefaction was accelerated , or if other causal factors were at work . In the city of Brussels , in 1633 , a woman died in convulsions and three days later the fetus was spontaneously expelled . In Weissenfels , in 1861 , postmortem fetal extrusion was observed sixty hours after the death of a pregnant woman . Other cases are described , though only a few describe the unexpected discovery of fetal remains following exhumation . Most cases occurred prior to burial ; in some of these , the body was in the casket while in other cases the body was still on its deathbed or on a bier .",

  "The primary physiological cue for migration are the changes in the day length . These changes are also related to hormonal changes in the birds . In the period before migration , many birds display higher activity or Zugunruhe ( German : migratory restlessness ) , first described by Johann Friedrich Naumann in 1795 , as well as physiological changes such as increased fat deposition . The occurrence of Zugunruhe even in cage @-@ raised birds with no environmental cues ( e.g. shortening of day and falling temperature ) has pointed to the role of circannual endogenous programs in controlling bird migrations . Caged birds display a preferential flight direction that corresponds with the migratory direction they would take in nature , changing their preferential direction at roughly the same time their wild conspecifics change course .",

  "Like many of Keats 's odes , \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" discusses art and art 's audience . He relied on depictions of natural music in earlier poems , and works such as \" Ode to a Nightingale \" appeal to auditory sensations while ignoring the visual . Keats reverses this when describing an urn within \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" to focus on representational art . He previously used the image of an urn in \" Ode on Indolence \" , depicting one with three figures representing Love , Ambition and Poesy . Of these three , Love and Poesy are integrated into \" Ode on a Grecian Urn \" with an emphasis on how the urn , as a human artistic construct , is capable of relating to the idea of \" Truth \" . The images of the urn described within the poem are intended as obvious depictions of common activities : an attempt at courtship , the making of music , and a religious rite . The figures are supposed to be beautiful , and the urn itself is supposed to be realistic . Although the poem does not include the subjective involvement of the narrator , the description of the urn within the poem implies a human observer that draws out these images . The narrator interacts with the urn in a manner similar to how a critic would respond to the poem , which creates ambiguity in the poem 's final lines : \" ' Beauty is truth , truth beauty , ' – that is all / Ye know on earth , and all ye need to know . \" The lack of a definite voice of the urn causes the reader to question who is really speaking these words , to whom they are speaking , and what is meant by the words , which encourages the reader to interact with the poem in an interrogative manner like the narrator .",

  "During a couple of the Svea flights , Andrée tested and tried out the drag @-@ rope steering technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition . Drag ropes , which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground , are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter @-@ than @-@ air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind , a situation that makes steering by sails impossible . The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon to the point where the sails would have an effect ( beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis ) . Andrée reported , and presumably believed , that with drag rope / sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction . This notion is rejected by modern balloonists ; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée 's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken , being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility . Use of drag ropes ( prone to snapping , falling off , or becoming entangled with each other or the ground , in addition to being ineffective ) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique .",

  "RNAi in vivo delivery to tissues still eludes science — especially to tissues deep within the body . RNAi delivery is only easily accessible to surface tissues such as the eye and respiratory tract . In these instances , siRNA has been used in direct contact with the tissue for transport . The resulting RNAi successfully focused on target genes . When delivering siRNA to deep tissues , the siRNA must be protected from nucleases , but targeting specific areas becomes the main difficulty . This difficulty has been combatted with high dosage levels of siRNA to ensure the tissues have been reached , however in these cases hepatotoxicity was reported .",

  "After Marathon , probably in 489 , Miltiades , the hero of the battle , was seriously wounded in an abortive attempt to capture Paros . Taking advantage of his incapacitation , the powerful Alcmaeonid family arranged for him to be prosecuted . The Athenian aristocracy , and indeed Greek aristocrats in general , were loath to see one person pre @-@ eminent , and such maneuvers were commonplace . Miltiades was given a massive fine for the crime of ' deceiving the Athenian people ' , but died weeks later as a result of his wound . In the wake of this prosecution , the Athenian people chose to use a new institution of the democracy , which had been part of Cleisthenes 's reforms , but remained so far unused . This was ' ostracism ' — each Athenian citizen was required to write on a shard of pottery ( ostrakon ) the name of a politician that they wished to see exiled for a period of ten years . This may have been triggered by Miltiades 's prosecution , and used by the Athenians to try and stop such power @-@ games among the noble families . Certainly , in the years ( 487 BC ) following , the heads of the prominent families , including the Alcmaeonids , were exiled . The career of a politician in Athens thus became fraught with more difficulty , since displeasing the population was likely to result in exile .",

  "The experience held a number of lessons for the Australians , not least of all was the need for tanks . Although the APCs had been used to support the infantry during the operation , they lacked the firepower and armour to be an effective substitute for tanks which would likely have found the terrain and vegetation no obstacle and may have proven decisive . Meanwhile , the futility and waste of frontal tactics and massed bayonet charges against automatic weapons had once again been demonstrated . Yet such lessons still had not been fully grasped by Australian Army training doctrine , and under pressure from Townsend to press on with the attack Mackay had given the order to fix bayonets and charge due to the proximity of his forward platoons to the Viet Cong . Despite having long since ceased to be a decisive weapon of warfare , when ordered the Australians had unhesitatingly charged towards the Viet Cong machine @-@ guns in the certainty of suffering casualties . As a result of their bravery 5 Platoon became one of the most highly decorated Australian platoons of the war .

The holotype material was collected from Wissahickon Creek Park ( Philadelphia ) in 2008 ; the species description is based on collections made from 2001 – 2008 . Vlasák had first noted the presence of the species and its similarity to the common European species Antrodia serialiformis in a 2004 publication . The degree of variability between the DNA sequences of the internal transcribed spacer regions Antrodia serialiformis and A. serialis confirm that the two species are genetically distinct . The specific epithet serialiformis refers to its resemblance to A. serialis ( the Latin adjective -formis derives from forma , meaning \" having the form of \" ) .",

Andy Eddy of TeamXbox praised the game 's strong voice acting , but noted the uninspired gameplay , which was \" not very consistent in its fun generation . \" Justin Calvert of GameSpot claimed that the game \" has too much backtracking and too many camera problems to make it recommendable \" . Official Xbox Magazine concluded that \" there 's very little about Mind over Mutant that makes it worth your $ 50 or the four hours it takes to complete . \" Dan Pearson of Eurogamer criticized the game 's fixed camera , extensive backtracking , useless mission log and dated concepts .

  "After finishing his work on Trouble in Mind , Divine again became involved with a John Waters project , the film Hairspray ( 1988 ) . Set in Baltimore during the 1960s , Hairspray revolved around self @-@ proclaimed \" pleasantly plump \" teenager Tracy Turnblad as she pursues stardom as a dancer on a local television show and rallies against racial segregation . As he had in Waters 's earlier film Female Trouble , Divine took on two roles in the film , one of which was male and the other female . The first of these , Edna Turnblad , was Tracy 's loving mother ; Divine would later note that with this character he could not be accurately described as a drag queen , proclaiming \" What drag queen would allow herself to look like this ? I look like half the women from Baltimore . \" His second character in the film was that of the racist television station owner Arvin Hodgepile . In one interview , Divine admitted that he had hoped to play both the role of mother and daughter in Hairspray , but that the producers had been \" a bit leery \" and chose Ricki Lake for the latter role instead . Divine went on to state his opinion on Lake , jokingly telling the interviewer that \" She is nineteen and delightful . I hate her . \" In reality they had become good friends while working together on set . Reviews of the film were predominantly positive , with Divine in particular being singled out for praise ; several commentators expressed their opinion that the film marked Divine 's breakthrough into mainstream cinema . He subsequently took his mother to the film 's premier in the Miami Film Festival before she once more accompanied him to the Baltimore premier , this time also with several of his other relatives . After the screening , a party was held at the Baltimore Museum of Art , where Frances Milstead granted an impromptu interview to the English film critic Jonathan Ross , a friend and fan of Divine 's .",
  "Before the film was released , rumors and allegations began to circulate that Battlefield Earth contained subliminal messages promoting Scientology . Former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim , in a press release issued by his group Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network , said that the Church of Scientology \" has placed highly advanced subliminal messages in the Battlefield Earth film master to surreptitiously recruit new members from the movie audience and to get the audience to develop a revulsion for psychiatry and current mental health organizations and practices \" . Other critics said that the film \" is a veiled attempt to gain converts and influence \" , and that writers were gagged from making connections between Scientology and the film with threats of lawsuits . Warner Bros. dismissed the claims as \" silly nonsense \" , the Church of Scientology denounced them as \" hogwash \" and the media reacted with skepticism ; as the Scottish journalist Duncan Campbell put it , \" the only subliminal voice I could detect came about 10 minutes into this 121 @-@ minute film and it seemed to be saying Leeeaaave thisssss cinemmmaaa nooow \" . When asked about the similarities between the film and Scientology beliefs in intergalactic travel and aliens , church spokesman Aron Mason stated , \" That 's a pretty crude parallel ...

  "The Bronze Age in Scotland lasted from approximately 2200 BC to 800 BC and northern Scotland has produced a relative dearth of remains from this period in comparison to the Neolithic and later Iron Age . This may in part be due to deteriorating weather conditions in the second millennium BC . In Orkney , fewer large stone structures were built during this period , burials were now being made in small cists well away from the great megalithic sites and a new Beaker culture began to dominate . Nonetheless the great ceremonial circles continued in use as bronze metalworking was slowly introduced to Scotland from Europe over a lengthy period . There is agreement amongst historians that from about 1000 BC it is legitimate to talk of a Celtic culture in Scotland , although the nature of the Orcadian Celtic civilisation and their relationships to their neighbours remains largely unknown .",
