The Cao Đài faith attracted both Vietnamese and Cambodian adherents within the first few years of its founding , but a royal decree which outlawed the religion and efforts by Cambodian nationalists to prosecute Khmer adherents led to Cao Dai being observed solely by Vietnamese from the 1930s onwards .

They may have ruled the southern and northern Mercians respectively . That Penda ruled the southern part is a possibility suggested by his early involvement in the area of the Hwicce , to the south of Mercia , as well as by the fact that , after Penda 's death , his son Peada was allowed to rule southern Mercia while the northern part was placed under direct Northumbrian control .",

  "In general , the authors of the New Testament showed little interest in an absolute chronology of Jesus or in synchronizing the episodes of his life with the secular history of the age . As stated in John 21 : 25 , the gospels do not claim to provide an exhaustive list of the events in the life of Jesus . The accounts were primarily written as theological documents in the context of early Christianity , with timelines as a secondary consideration . One manifestation of the gospels as theological documents rather than historical chronicles is that they devote about one third of their text to just seven days , namely the last week of the life of Jesus in Jerusalem , referred to as the Passion . Although the gospels do not provide enough details to satisfy the demands of modern historians regarding exact dates , it is possible to draw from them a general picture of the life story of Jesus .",

  "Although seal predation is the primary and an indispensable way of life for most polar bears , when alternatives are present they are quite flexible . Polar bears will consume a wide variety of other wild foods , including muskox ( Ovibos moschatus ) , reindeer ( Rangifer tarandus ) , birds , eggs , rodents , crabs , other crustaceans and other polar bears . They may also eat plants , including berries , roots , and kelp ; however , none of these are a significant part of their diet , except that beachcast marine mammal carcasses are an exception . When stalking land animals , such as muskox , reindeer , and even willow ptarmigan ( Lagopus lagopus ) , polar bears appear to make use of vegetative cover and wind direction to bring them as close to their prey as possible before attacking . Polar bears have been observed to hunt the small Svalbard reindeer ( R. t. platyrhynchus ) , which weigh only 40 to 60 kg ( 90 to 130 lb ) as adults , as well as the barren @-@ ground caribou ( R. t. groenlandicus ) , which is about twice as heavy as that . Adult muskox , which can weigh 450 kg ( 1 @,@ 000 lb ) or more , are a more formidable quarry . Although ungulates are not typical prey , the killing of one during the summer months can greatly increase the odds of survival during that lean period . Like the brown bear , most ungulate prey of polar bears is likely to be young , sickly or injured specimens rather than healthy adults . The polar bear 's biology is specialized to require large amounts of fat from marine mammals , and it cannot derive sufficient caloric intake from terrestrial food .",

  "Oxidative phosphorylation works by using energy @-@ releasing chemical reactions to drive energy @-@ requiring reactions : The two sets of reactions are said to be coupled . This means one cannot occur without the other . The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain , from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen , is an exergonic process – it releases energy , whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process , which requires an input of energy . Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane , and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane , in a process called chemiosmosis .

  "By 1809 , the Napoleonic Wars were six years old and the British Royal Navy was dominant at sea . Blockaded in their home ports by British squadrons , French warships , merchant ships and transports were unable to sail and , as a result , the French colonies in the West Indies were largely cut off from France . These colonies were also closely blockaded themselves and , as a result , their ability to trade independently was severely curtailed , resulting in economic collapse , severe food shortages and social unrest . Messages warning of the deteriorating situation in the colonies had been sent during the summer of 1808 , particularly from the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe . In response supplies had been sent from France in small convoys and individual frigates in the autumn . The British blockading ships had also intercepted the communications from the island , and relayed the information to the Admiralty in London , who had ordered Vice @-@ Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane to assemble a force and invade the French colonies before reinforcements and supplies could reach them .",
  "Naval gunnery in the 17th century was still in its infancy . Guns were expensive and had a much longer lifespan than any warship . Guns with a lifetime of over a century were not unheard of , while most warships would be used for only 15 to 20 years . In Sweden and many other European countries , a ship would normally not \" own \" its guns , but would be issued armament from the armory for every campaign season . Ships were therefore usually fitted with guns of very diverse age and size . What allowed Vasa to carry so much firepower was not merely that an unusually large number of guns were crammed into a relatively small ship , but also that the 46 main 24 @-@ pounder guns were of a new and standardized lightweight design , cast in a single series at the state gun foundry in Stockholm , under the direction of the Swiss @-@ born founder Medardus Gessus . Two additional 24 @-@ pounders , of a heavier and older design , were mounted in the bows , the so @-@ called bow chasers . Four more heavy guns were intended for the stern , but the cannon foundry could not cast guns as fast as the navy yard could build ships , and Vasa waited nearly a year after construction was finished for its armament . When the ship sailed in August 1628 , eight of the planned armament of 72 guns had still not been delivered . All cannons during this time had to be made from individually made moulds that could not be reused , but Vasa 's guns had such uniform precision in their manufacturing that their primary dimensions varied by only a few millimeters , and their bores were almost exactly 146 mm ( 5 @.@ 7 in ) . The remaining armament of Vasa consisted of eight 3 @-@ pounders , six large caliber stormstycken ( similar to what the English called howitzers ) for use during boarding actions , and two 1 @-@ pound falconets . Also included on board were 894 kilograms ( 1 @,@ 970 lb ) of gunpowder and over 1000 shot of various types for the guns .",

  "After laying , the mother 's nutritional reserves are exhausted and she very carefully transfers the egg to the male , before immediately returning to the sea for two months to feed . The transfer of the egg can be awkward and difficult , and many couples drop the egg in the process . When this happens , the chick inside is quickly lost , as the egg cannot withstand the freezing temperatures on the icy ground . The male spends the dark winter incubating the egg in his brood pouch , balancing it on the tops of his feet , for 64 consecutive days until hatching . The emperor penguin is the only species where this behaviour is observed ; in all other penguin species both parents take shifts incubating . By the time the egg hatches , the male will have fasted for around 115 days since arriving at the colony . To survive the cold and winds of up to 200 km / h ( 120 mph ) , the males huddle together , taking turns in the middle of the huddle . They have also been observed with their backs to the wind to conserve body heat . In the four months of travel , courtship , and incubation , the male may lose as much as 20 kg ( 44 lb ) , from a total mass of 38 to 18 kg ( 84 to 40 lb ) .",

The race was on among the royal dukes to marry and produce an heir . William had great advantages in this race — his two older brothers were both childless and estranged from their wives , who were both beyond childbearing age anyway , and William was the healthiest of the three . If he lived long enough , he would almost certainly ascend the British and Hanoverian thrones , and have the opportunity to sire the next monarch .

  "Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s . Further changes took place in the early twentieth century , when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat , with concrete ' rocks ' , more open space and a moat instead of bars . He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney 's Taronga Zoo , among others , in the early twentieth century . Though his designs were popular , the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos . In the later decades of the twentieth century , larger , more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals , with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors , such as the Cat Forest / Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park . Lions are now housed in much larger naturalistic areas ; modern recommended guidelines more closely approximate conditions in the wild with closer attention to the lions ' needs , highlighting the need for dens in separate areas , elevated positions in both sun and shade where lions can sit and adequate ground cover and drainage as well as sufficient space to roam . There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual , such as the lioness Elsa , who was raised by George Adamson and his wife Joy Adamson and came to develop a strong bond with them , particularly the latter .

  "Before the Human Rights Act was brought before parliament , the government 's whitepaper considered that it was necessary to prevent courts from setting aside legislation on the basis of incompatibility ( reflecting a strong need to respect parliamentary sovereignty ) . However , the effect on parliamentary sovereignty has been criticised despite the safeguards put in place . Section 3 has been defended , however , by reference to the enhanced morality and constitutionalism of the new system , prompted by an \" incoming tide \" of human rights . Aileen Kavanagh considers the choice of a court in cases not a question of parliamentary sovereignty , but a complex question of how far the judiciary can perform a legislative function in that area . She considers the political and legislative pressure on government after section 3 or 4 overwhelming to the extent that the concept of parliamentary sovereignty should be \" eliminated \" . However , other writers have stressed the important of the formal right to ignore either decision . The result of this debate has been to label section 3 either a \" radical tool \" to implement human rights , or a \" signficiant limitation \" of Parliament 's will .",

  "The three principal players at Versailles were Britain 's Lloyd George , France 's Clemenceau and America 's President Wilson . It was only Lloyd George to whom Keynes had much direct access ; until the 1918 election he had some sympathy with Keynes 's view but while campaigning had found his speeches were only well received by the public if he promised to harshly punish Germany , and had therefore committed his delegation to extracting high payments . Lloyd George did however win some loyalty from Keynes with his actions at the Paris conference by intervening against the French to ensure the dispatch of much @-@ needed food supplies to German civilians . Clemenceau also pushed for substantial reparations , though not as high as those proposed by the British , while on security grounds , France argued for an even more severe settlement than Britain . Wilson initially favoured relatively lenient treatment of Germany – he feared too harsh conditions could foment the rise of extremism , and wanted Germany to be left sufficient capital to pay for imports . To Keynes 's dismay , Lloyd George and Clemenceau were able to pressure Wilson to agree to include pensions in the reparations bill . Towards the end of the conference , Keynes came up with a plan that he argued would not only help Germany and other impoverished central European powers but also be good for the world economy as a whole . It involved the radical writing down of war debts , which would have had the possible effect of increasing international trade all round , but at the same time thrown the entire cost of European reconstruction on the United States . Lloyd George agreed it might be acceptable to the British electorate . However , America was against the plan ; the US was then the largest creditor , and by this time Wilson had started to believe in the merits of a harsh peace and thought that his country had already made excessive sacrifices . Hence despite his best efforts , the end result of the conference was a treaty which disgusted Keynes both on moral and economic grounds , and led to his resignation from the Treasury .",

  "In contrast to the view that science rests on foundational assumptions , coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system . Or , rather , individual statements cannot be validated on their own : only coherent systems can be justified .

That is , it relies on a pre @-@ existing understanding , a systematic set of beliefs . An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs , such as those that describe the optics of telescopes , the mechanics of the telescope mount , and an understanding of celestial mechanics . If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed , that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system , a change in some auxiliary assumption , rather than a rejection of the theoretical system .",

  "In August , the British finally launched their campaign to capture New York City . They first landed on Long Island in force , and flanked Washington 's forward positions in the Battle of Long Island . General Howe refused to act on a significant tactical advantage that could have resulted in the capture of the remaining Continental troops on Long Island , but he chose instead to besiege their positions . Although Washington has been criticized by many historians for sending additional troops to reinforce the redoubts on Long Island , it was clear to both Washington and the Howes that the Americans had successfully blocked the East River against major shipping by sinking ships in the channel , and that he was consequently not risking the entrapment of additional men . In the face of a siege he seemed certain to lose , Washington then decided to withdraw . In what some historians call one of his greatest military feats , he executed a nighttime withdrawal from Long Island across the East River to Manhattan to save those troops .",

The success of Goodrich 's design influenced many other constructions across England over the following years . It became the seat of the powerful Talbot family before falling out of favour as a residence in late Tudor times .",

  "After developer MachineGames was founded , the employees all began brainstorming ideas , and pitching them to publishers . In June 2009 , MachineGames owner ZeniMax Media acquired id Software and all of its property , including Doom , Quake and Wolfenstein . Bethesda Softworks , who had previously declined a pitch from MachineGames , suggested that they develop a new game from a franchise acquired by ZeniMax . MachineGames inquired about developing a new game in the Wolfenstein series ; the studio visited id Software , who approved of MachineGames ' request for a new Wolfenstein game . By November 2010 , paperwork was signed , allowing MachineGames to develop Wolfenstein : The New Order . Preliminary development lasted approximately three years .",
  "In 1787 Dennie was admitted to the sophomore class of Harvard College , where he was very popular with his peers . This popularity did not extend to his tutors , and he was suspended in December 1789 for six months after insulting the faculty . Dennie had difficulty finding suitable employment after earning his degree in 1790 , but by 1793 he was practicing law ( though earning very little for his work ) . In a January 1794 letter to his parents , however , Dennie reports that he had been appointed as a reader for the Episcopalian church in Charlestown , New Hampshire . Nevertheless , he insisted that this new vocation would not deter him from his goal of practicing law , though by then he was planning on remaining in New Hampshire to practice rather than returning to Massachusetts . Shortly after writing the letter , Dennie was admitted to the Court of Common Pleas and opened a practice in Charlestown . However , he rarely appeared in open court ; indeed , he probably made only one appearance .",
  "The 1984 Atlantic hurricane season was the busiest since 1971 . It officially began on June 1 , 1984 , and lasted until November 30 , 1984 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . The 1984 season was an active one in terms of named storms , but most of them were weak and stayed at sea . Most of the cyclones tracked through the northwest subtropical Atlantic west of the 50th meridian to near the Eastern coast of the United States between mid @-@ August and early October . The most damaging storm was Hurricane Diana , which caused $ 65 @.@ 5 million ( 1984 dollars ) in damage in North Carolina . Diana was the first hurricane to strike a nuclear power plant without incident ; it was also the first major hurricane to strike the U.S. East Coast in nearly 20 years . Also of note was Hurricane Lili , which lasted well after the official end of the season . It was downgraded from a named storm on December 24 . Damage overall from the tropical cyclones in 1984 totaled $ 66 @.@ 4 million ( 1984 USD ) .",

  "After Tosca 's \" Non la sospiri \" and the subsequent argument inspired by her jealousy , the sensuous character of the love duet \" Qual 'occhio \" provides what opera writer Burton Fisher describes as \" an almost erotic lyricism that has been called pornophony \" . The brief scene in which the sacristan returns with the choristers to celebrate Napoleon 's supposed defeat provides almost the last carefree moments in the opera ; after the entrance of Scarpia to his menacing theme , the mood becomes sombre , then steadily darker . As the police chief interrogates the sacristan , the \" fugitive \" motif recurs three more times , each time more emphatically , signalling Scarpia 's success in his investigation . In Scarpia 's exchanges with Tosca the sound of tolling bells , interwoven with the orchestra , creates an almost religious atmosphere , for which Puccini draws on music from his then unpublished Mass of 1880 . The final scene in the act is a juxtaposition of the sacred and the profane , as Scarpia 's lustful reverie is sung alongside the swelling Te Deum chorus . He joins with the chorus in the final statement \" Te aeternum Patrem omnis terra veneratur \" ( \" Everlasting Father , all the earth worships thee \" ) , before the act ends with a thunderous restatement of the Scarpia motif .",

  "The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts . A surviving treatise by Frontinus , who served as curator aquarum ( water commissioner ) under Nerva , reflects the administrative importance placed on ensuring the water supply . Masonry channels carried water from distant springs and reservoirs along a precise gradient , using gravity alone . After the water passed through the aqueduct , it was collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains , baths , toilets , or industrial sites . The main aqueducts in the city of Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia . The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120 km away along a sinuous route of more than 336 km . Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine tolerance , and to a technological standard that was not to be equalled until modern times . The Romans also made use of aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire , at sites such as Las Medulas and Dolaucothi in South Wales .",

  "During the confused fighting , French and Russian units moved forward into impenetrable smoke and were smashed by artillery and musketry fire that was horrendous even by Napoleonic standards . Infantry and cavalrymen had difficulty maneuvering over the heaps of corpses and masses of wounded . Murat advanced with his cavalry around the flèches to attack Bagration 's infantry , but was confronted by Duka 's 2nd Cuirassier Division supported by Neverovsky 's infantry . The French carried out seven assaults against the flèches and each time were beaten back in fierce close combat . Bagration in some instances was personally leading counterattacks , and in a final attempt to push the French completely back he got hit in the leg by cannonball splinters somewhere around 11 : 00 hours . He insisted on staying on the field to observe Duka 's decisive cavalry attack . This counter punch drove Murat to seek the cover of allied Württemberger infantry . Barclay 's reinforcements , however , were sent into the fray only to be torn to pieces by French artillery , leaving Friant 's Division in control of the Russian forward position at 11 : 30 . Dust , smoke , confusion , and exhaustion all combined to keep the French commanders on the field ( Davout , Ney , and Murat ) from comprehending that all the Russians before them had fallen back , were in confusion , and ripe for the taking . The 2nd Army 's command structure fell apart as Bagration was evacuated from the battlefield and the report of him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse . Napoleon , who had been sick with a cold and was too far from the action to really observe what was going on , refused to send his subordinates reinforcements ; he was hesitant to release his last reserve , the Imperial Guard , so far from France .",

  "It has also been theoretized that tyrannosaurids had such protofeathers . However , rare skin impressions from adult tyrannosaurids in Canada and Mongolia show pebbly scales typical of other dinosaurs . While it is possible that protofeathers existed on parts of the body that have not been preserved , a lack of insulatory body covering is consistent with modern multi @-@ ton mammals , such as elephants , hippopotamus , and most species of rhinoceros . As an object increases in size , its ability to retain heat increases due to its decreasing surface area @-@ to @-@ volume ratio . Therefore , as large animals evolve in or disperse into warm climates , a coat of fur or feathers loses its selective advantage for thermal insulation and can instead become a disadvantage , as the insulation traps excess heat inside the body , possibly overheating the animal . Protofeathers may also have been secondarily lost during the evolution of large tyrannosaurids , especially in warm Cretaceous climates . A precedent can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians , in which filamentous structures were lost , and scales reappeared .",

Its official sea trials were conducted in September 1923 , and it was commissioned on 26 February 1924 . The new ship was sent to the Mediterranean Fleet in June , and alternated between refits in the United Kingdom ( 1926 , 1929 ) and the Mediterranean until 1931 , when Eagle was sent to show the flag on a South American cruise .

  "While rapidly losing characteristics of a tropical cyclone , Edna traversed central New Brunswick . In contrast with the smaller , more compact Hurricane Juan , which struck Atlantic Canada in 2003 , Edna was a much larger storm with strong winds extending hundreds of miles from the center . The tightest pressure gradient was focused on the east side of the storm , over mainland Nova Scotia . Edna brought down approximately 700 million board feet of timber , and although the amount of trees the storm destroyed was comparable to that of Juan , its effects were more widespread and not as locally severe . Sustained winds reached 160 km / h ( 99 mph ) at Yarmouth and 95 km / h ( 59 mph ) at Halifax . The intense winds downed power and telephone lines and destroyed many barns ; one such structural collapse killed a man , and livestock were lost throughout the region .

  "As Tropical Storm Alex progressed through the western Caribbean Sea towards the Yucatán Peninsula , it developed a large field of clouds accompanied by well @-@ established outflow throughout its circulation . Its inner structure was initially disorganized , although by late on June 26 , it became better defined . At about 2100 UTC , as the tropical storm approached the Belize coast , a Hurricane Hunters flight reported winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) ; early on June 27 , Alex made landfall just north of Belize City at this intensity . Upon moving ashore , an area of convection increased over the center , and the convection initially became better defined as it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula . While most tropical cyclones weaken and become disorganized after landfall , Alex seemed to become stronger when viewed on radar and satellite imagery — the National Hurricane Center noted in one of its forecast discussions that the cyclone 's structure more closely resembled a hurricane than a deteriorating storm . Still , after enough time over land , convective activity markedly decreased , and Alex weakened to tropical depression status as it approached the peninsula 's western coastline . Late on June 27 , the depression emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with a large overall convective structure but little thunderstorm activity near the center due to the interaction with land .",

  "How the ostensibly weak @-@ swimming frilled shark captures active , fast @-@ moving squid is a matter of speculation . One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid , or those that are exhausted and dying after spawning .

It may also be able to close its gill slits and create negative pressure to suck prey into its mouth . The many small , sharp , recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid jigs and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid , particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded .

  "Fieldwork in 1996 turned up a spectacularly complete theropod skull preserved in exquisite detail ( FMNH PR 2100 ) . On top of this skull was a dome @-@ shaped swelling nearly identical to the one described by Sues and Taquet as Majungatholus atopus . Majungatholus was redescribed as an abelisaurid rather than a pachycephalosaur in 1998 . Although the name Majungasaurus crenatissimus was older than Majungatholus atopus , the authors judged the type dentary of Majungasaurus too fragmentary to confidently assign to the same species as the skull . Further fieldwork over the next decade turned up a series of less complete skulls , as well as dozens of partial skeletons of individuals ranging from juveniles to adults . Project members also collected hundreds of isolated bones and thousands of shed Majungasaurus teeth . Taken together , these remains represent nearly all the bones of the skeleton , although most of the forelimbs , most of the pelvis and the tip of the tail are still unknown . This fieldwork culminated in a 2007 monograph consisting of seven scientific papers on all aspects of the animal 's biology , published in the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology Memoirs . The papers are in English , although each has an abstract written in Malagasy . In this volume , the dentary described by Lavocat was re @-@ evaluated and determined to be diagnostic for this species .

On the basis of their survey , the cathedral was declared to belong primarily to the Ukrainian Baroque style , rather than to the twelfth century as was previously thought , and thus did not merit preservation due to its lack of historical and artistic value .

  "The karmic bondage occurs as a result of the following two processes : āsrava and bandha . Āsrava is the inflow of karma . The karmic influx occurs when the particles are attracted to the soul on account of yoga . Yoga is the vibrations of the soul due to activities of mind , speech and body . However , the yoga alone do not produce bondage . The karmas have effect only when they are bound to the consciousness . This binding of the karma to the consciousness is called bandha . Out of the many causes of bondage , emotions or passions are considered as the main cause of bondage . The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions . The passions like anger , pride , deceit and greed are called sticky ( kaṣāyas ) because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in bandha . The karmic inflow on account of yoga driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations . On the other hand , the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient , short @-@ lived karmic effect .

Beauchamp later said he had ignored the warrant , dated October 25 , 1825 , on the advice of a friend who termed it harassment . He also said he had arranged for the warrant , as an excuse to be in Frankfort to kill Sharp . The historian Fred Johnson says that Beauchamp likely added the warrant into his story after the fact , as a means of damage control .

  "Northern mockingbirds adjust the sex ratio of their offspring according to the food availability and population density . Male offspring usually require more parental investment . There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex at the beginning of a breeding season when the food is abundant . Local resource competition predicts that the parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation . In passerine birds , like the northern mockingbird , females are more likely to disperse than males . Hence , it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense . Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments , it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio .",

On 12 May , Sedan was captured without resistance . In the following days , the Germans defeated the French defences surrounding Sedan on the west bank of the Meuse .

  "Newborns have black natal coats and bright pink skin . Females are the primary caregivers of infants , but males also play a role . In its first few days , the infant may be unable to stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support . However , its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother 's fur by itself . By two weeks , the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods , but stays near her . The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets . In general , higher @-@ ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank , which usually keep their offspring close to them . However , this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant 's life . Olive baboons do not seem to practice co @-@ operative parenting , but a female may groom an infant that is not hers . Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another 's young , as they have not yet produced offspring of their own . One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers . Infant baboons born to first @-@ time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers , which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important . Adult males in the groups also care for the infants , as they are likely to be related to them . Males groom infants , reducing the amount of parasites they may have , and calm them when they are stressed . They may also protect them from predators , such as chimpanzees . However , adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them .",

  "The position of First Air Member was replaced by Chief of the Air Staff ( CAS ) in October 1922 . Williams would serve as CAS three times over seventeen years in the 1920s and ' 30s , alternating with Wing Commander ( later Air Vice Marshal ) Stanley Goble . One motive suggested for the rotation was a ploy by Army and Navy interests to \" curb Williams ' independence \" . Instead the arrangement \" almost inevitably fostered an unproductive rivalry \" between the two officers . Although in a legal sense the Air Board was responsible for the RAAF rather than the Chief of Staff alone , Williams dominated the board to such an extent that Goble would later complain that his colleague appeared to consider the Air Force his personal command .",

  "A second consequence of collapsing wheat prices was the threat they posed to the Alberta Wheat Pool ( AWP ) . Falling prices and the attendant tightened credit conditions led the Pool , along with its counterparts in Saskatchewan and Manitoba , to seek help from its provincial government in 1930 . Brownlee guaranteed loans to the Pool , but told the legislature that he did not expect this guarantee to prove necessary , since the large portions of the 1929 crop already sold at higher prices would provide sufficient cushioning unless wheat prices fell \" to a level never reached on Canadian markets \" . In October 1930 , with the Pool receiving a price for its wheat well below the $ 1 @.@ 00 per bushel that it guaranteed its farmers , the banks refused to loan more money unless the Pool appointed to its Central Selling Agency ( CSA ) a general manager acceptable to the banks . Brownlee and Premiers John Bracken of Manitoba and James Thomas Milton Anderson of Saskatchewan met in Ottawa with acting Prime Minister Sir George Perley , seeking direct federal aid to the Pools . The premiers ' pleas rejected , CSA President Alexander James McPhail offered the banks the names of two possible general managers . The first was John McFarland , former president of the Alberta Pacific Grain Company . The second was Brownlee . The banks chose McFarland . Brownlee too imposed conditions on the AWP as a condition of provincial assistance : he wanted the provincial government to be consulted on all AWP managerial decisions and given the right to veto capital expenditures , and he required it to increase its sales commission from three quarters of a cent per bushel to one cent . While these conditions met with resistance from farmer leaders who believed that they would transform the AWP from a farmers ' organization to a grain company like any other , Brownlee was supported by UFA President Henry Wise Wood , the AWP was reliant on provincial support , and the conditions were accepted .",

  "The result of breathing increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia , an excess of oxygen in body tissues . The body is affected in different ways depending on the type of exposure . Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure .

  "Polistes exclamans have comparably smaller nests and colonies compared to certain other eusocial wasps species . Thus , it is common for the nest to be destroyed , for the queen to die prior to the end of the season , or for the nest to fail through other means , such as predation , parasitisation , or worker mortality , leading workers to help rear broods that are less related to them than are their sister wasps . Due to this , it would be advantageous for there to be wasps that remain casteless till adulthood , allowing female wasps ’ reproductive capabilities to be plastic . It has thus been predicted that Polistes exclamans worker wasps would act as workers if a brood were present and would begin to develop gyne characteristics if a brood was not present , exhibiting the aforementioned adaptive plasticity . Experimentally , this has been found to be true . Solis and Strassmann conducted a study in which an experimental group had the eggs and larvae removed . In the experimental group , the wasps began to behave like future queens and even developed the characteristic layer of fat common to queens . In the control group , the wasps continued to behave as workers . This is indicative that the presence of the brood affects caste differentiation and that Polistes exclamans female workers exhibits adaptive reproductive plasticity .",

  "Parthenogenesis is a natural form of reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization . A. piscivorus can reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis , that is , they are capable of switching from a sexual mode of reproduction to an asexual mode . The type of parthenogenesis that likely occurs is “ automixis with terminal fusion ” , a process in which two terminal products from the same meiosis fuse to form a diploid zygote ( see Figure ) . This process leads to genome wide homozygosity , expression of deleterious recessive alleles and often to developmental failure ( inbreeding depression ) . Both captive @-@ born and wild @-@ born A. piscivorus appear to be capable of this form of parthenogenesis .",

In the Western Isles Ketill Flatnose was the dominant figure of the mid 9th century , by which time he had amassed a substantial island realm and made a variety of alliances with other Norse leaders . These princelings nominally owed allegiance to the Norwegian crown , although in practice the latter 's control was fairly limited . Norse control of the Hebrides was formalised in 1098 when Edgar of Scotland formally signed the islands over to Magnus III of Norway .

  "Egbert 's dominion over southern England came to an end with Wiglaf 's recovery of power . Wiglaf 's return is followed by evidence of his independence from Wessex . Charters indicate Wiglaf had authority in Middlesex and Berkshire , and in a charter of 836 Wiglaf uses the phrase \" my bishops , duces , and magistrates \" to describe a group that included eleven bishops from the episcopate of Canterbury , including bishops of sees in West Saxon territory . It is significant that Wiglaf was still able to call together such a group of notables ; the West Saxons , even if they were able to do so , held no such councils . Wiglaf may also have brought Essex back into the Mercian orbit during the years after he recovered the throne .

  "In 2011 , Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which Deinonychus and other dromaeosaurs may have captured and restrained prey . This model , known as the \" raptor prey restraint \" ( RPR ) model of predation , proposes that Deinonychus killed its prey in a manner very similar to extant accipitrid birds of prey : by leaping onto its quarry , pinning it under its body weight , and gripping it tightly with the large , sickle @-@ shaped claws . Like accipitrids , the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while still alive , until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure . This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors . Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of eagles and hawks , especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion . However , the short metatarsus and foot strength would have been more similar to that of owls . The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of Deinonychus 's anatomy , such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology . The arms were likely covered in long feathers , and may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop a struggling prey animal , along with the stiff counterbalancing tail . Its jaws , thought to have had a comparatively weak bite force , might be used for saw motion bites , like the modern Komodo dragon which also has a weak bite force , to finish off its prey if its kicks weren 't powerful enough .",

The original remains were destroyed in World War II , but additional material has come to light in recent years . It is unclear whether one or two species are represented in the fossils reported in the scientific literature . The best known species is S. aegyptiacus from Egypt , although a potential second species , S. maroccanus , has been recovered from Morocco .",

  "Having finished his school career , Crawford joined the first MCC tour of South Africa in the 1905 – 06 season . The team was not particularly strong — before the tour , critics judged it to possess the equivalent strength of a moderate county side . The MCC was criticised by the press in both England and South Africa for omitting many of the strongest players . As the youngest member of the team , Crawford was given the traditional role of writing press reports to be sent back home during the tour . When the team played in Worcester during the tour , the local press carried a report that Crawford planned to remain in South Africa . The 1906 Wisden carried the same story ; in a comment on his success in 1905 , it suggested that it was uncertain for how long he would play , and questioned whether , if he played Test cricket , he would do so for England or South Africa . The cricket historian Nigel Hart queries why Wisden mentioned South Africa ; Crawford 's only known connection came through his uncle , who had left South Africa five years before .",

Nick Briggs , who voiced the Daleks , planned to counter their bright colours with a more vicious voice . Moffat wanted to somehow incorporate \" Spitfires in space \" . A replica of a World War Two Spitfire was used in front of a greenscreen to shoot the live action parts of the scene and the image of the Spitfire , while the rest of the scene was computer @-@ generated . The sequence contained the line \" Broadsword to Danny Boy \" , a reference to a similar line in the film Where Eagles Dare . Gatiss provided the voice of the Spitfire pilot himself , doing one version clean and another with his hand over his mouth . In an interview in April 2010 , Gatiss described how the cameo came about :",
  "As for the development of the parochial system , David 's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained . Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the Early Middle Ages , and the kind of system introduced by David 's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning , rather than creation ; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England , but he did not create it .",

  "A 1989 document generally known as Aspects of Christian meditation set forth the position of the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation . The document , issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops , stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches . It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading , and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation . The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation should not be confused with prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God , a state that should always result in loving service to others . Without these truths , the letter said , meditation , which should be a flight from the self , can degenerate into a form of self @-@ absorption .",

The Benchers and Readers did little to arrest the decline of the practice of lecturers and readings , first because many probably believed ( as the students did ) that books were an adequate substitute , and secondly because many were keen to avoid the work of preparing a reading , which cut into their time as practising barristers .

  "Midazolam is sometimes used for the acute management of seizures . Long @-@ term use for the management of epilepsy is not recommended , however , due to the significant risk of tolerance ( which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective ) and the significant side effect of sedation .

Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments , and has advantages of being water @-@ soluble , having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle , which occurs with other benzodiazepines . Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures — due to the short half @-@ life of midazolam — in over 50 % of people treated , as well as treatment failure in 14 – 18 % of people with refractory status epilepticus .

  "The bowfin genome contains an intact ParaHox gene cluster , similar to the bichir and to most other vertebrates . This is in contrast , however , with teleost fishes , which have a fragmented ParaHox cluster , probably because of a whole genome duplication event in their lineage .
