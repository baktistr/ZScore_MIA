  "As a method of dismissal , handling the ball has been included in the laws of cricket since the original code was written in 1744 . In that document , it stated that \" If ye Striker touches or takes up ye Ball before she is lain quite still , unless asked by ye Bowler or Wicket Keeper , its out . \" Similar wording remained in the revision made to the laws thirty years later . The first batsman to be dismissed for handling the ball in first @-@ class cricket was James Grundy , who suffered the fate while playing for the MCC against Kent in 1857 . Prior to 1899 , a batsman could be given out for handling the ball even if they were doing so to remove a ball which had got stuck in their equipment or clothing . At the time , if one of the fielders removed the ball from the batsman 's clothing , they could claim a catch . It was in such a situation that George Bennett , the first player to be given out handled the ball in English county cricket , was dismissed in 1872 . The wicket of William Scotton in early 1887 was described by Gerald Brodribb as \" most unusual \" . In a match between the smokers and the non @-@ smokers involved in the 1886 – 87 Ashes series , Scotton faced the final delivery of the contest . Eager to claim the ball as a souvenir of the high @-@ scoring match , he defended the delivery and picked the ball up . The fielders — who also wanted the souvenir — appealed , and Scotton was ruled out .",
  "The National Hurricane Center stated in its forecast on September 3 that Gabrielle had a 10 percent chance of affecting the Leeward Islands in three days . On September 5 , meteorologists forecast the storm to bypass north of the Virgin Islands and told the press that it is too early to suggest that the storm might hit the United States four or five days ahead of its current position . As Hurricane Gabrielle moved west @-@ northwest , forecasters at the National Hurricane Center advised residents along the East Coast of the United States to monitor the storm because of its large size and strong swells it is producing . When Gabrielle , recurved northwestward , the National Hurricane Center forecast the outer edge of the hurricane to graze Bermuda , bringing tropical storm force winds and strong waves to the island . In Bermuda , cruise ships and other water craft were advised of rough seas and many residents rushed to stores to buy emergency supplies .",

  "If a device key is to be revoked , the media key blocks on all discs manufactured after the time of revocation are encrypted in a way which does not enable the revoked device to obtain a valid processing key . Users trying to view new content on a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version , thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered . While a compromised device or processing key could be used to decrypt a large number of discs , BackupHDDVD does not use these keys because they can be revoked by AACS LA . Because the AACS revocation system works by preventing a given device or player from calculating a valid volume unique key , BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely by relying on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players . With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to device revocation and is able to decrypt the content directly , bypassing the key exchange and verification process .",

  "With the development of the U.S. railroad system , natural ice became used to transport larger quantities of goods much longer distances through the invention of the refrigerator car . The first refrigerator cars emerged in the late 1850s and early 1860s , and were crude constructions holding up to 3 @,@ 000 lbs ( 1 @,@ 360 kg ) of ice , on top of which the food was placed . It was quickly found that placing meat directly on top of blocks of ice in cars caused it to perish ; subsequent designs hung the meat from hooks , allowing the meat to breathe , while the swinging carcasses improved the circulation in the car . After the Civil War , J. B Sutherland , John Bate and William Davis all patented improved refrigerator cars , which used stacks of ice placed at either end and improved air circulation to keep their contents cool . This improved ventilation was essential to avoid warm air building up in the car and causing damage to the goods . Salt could be added to the ice to increase the cooling effect to produce an iced refrigerator car , which preserved foods even better . For much of the 19th century , the different gauges of train lines made it difficult and time consuming to move chilled cargoes between lines , which was a problem when the ice was continually melting ; by the 1860s , refrigerator cars with adjustable axles were being created to speed up this process .",

  "Napoleon faced Archduke Charles 's Austrian army at the Battle of Eckmühl , on 21 – 22 April 1809 . On 22 April , the second day of the battle , Nansouty was at first sent to the Schierling plain , in support of Bavarian General Deroy , who , after several failed attempts , managed to take the town of Eckmühl from the enemy . Apart from the Schierling plain , the terrain at Eckmühl was very uneven and hilly , with dangerously steep slopes , which made cavalry action here improper . Yet , it was here that one of the most memorable cavalry actions of the entire Napoleonic Wars was to take place . It all began on the slopes next to Eckmühl , where a first brief cavalry engagement occurred , as Bavarian and Württemberger cavalry encountered and charged Austrian cavalry . The Austrians won out and the Bavarians and Württembergers retreated and reformed in the vicinity of the two French heavy cavalry divisions present . These two divisions , the 1st under Nansouty ( 1st and 2nd Carabiniers @-@ à @-@ cheval , 2nd , 3rd , 9th and 12th Cuirassiers ) and the 2nd under Saint @-@ Sulpice ( four regiments strong ) , were placed next to one another , forming five lines , with their regiments in column , one in front of the other .

Arriving on the plateau at a gallop , the cavalry overtook Marshal Lannes 's infantry , who admiringly cheered \" Vive les cuirassiers \" ( \" Long live the cuirassiers \" ) and applauded as the cavalry galloped past them , . With their two frontline regiments now deployed in line and with the German light cavalry protecting their flanks , the two heavy cavalry divisions clashed into whatever Austrian cavalry they could find on the plateau , repulsing them with ease . This was , however , only the prelude of a much larger cavalry combat .",

It challenges several long @-@ standing ideas about this period : that the \" Hampton @-@ Tuskegee system \" and its adherents stunted the progress of African Americans , that the Hampton Institute ideology was opposed to that of historically black and historically white colleges , and that the positions of W.

Engs 's Armstrong , in \" paternal ... arrogance \" believed that he and others of higher status could best determine how to improve the lots of those suppressed by \" lack of opportunity and discrimination \" , such as African Americans and American Indians . This intuition , of knowing \" what was best for the freedmen \" , was influenced by his experience in missionary work , where his parents treated the indigenous Hawaiians as misbehaving children with behavior to be corrected . The biography distills Armstrong 's philosophy , demeanor , and understanding of African Americans from his experiences as a missionary , student of Williams College , and leader in the American Civil War . Engs dismisses polarized interpretations of Armstrong 's legacy as either a savior or a handicap for uneducated blacks . Instead , Armstrong is portrayed as a complex man who believes both in \" black inferiority \" and that freedmen could improve their lives through his lessons .",

  "The development of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy . The device uses a magnet to bend the trajectory of a beam of ions , and the amount of deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom 's mass to its charge . The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses . The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts , called the whole number rule . The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron , an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton , by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932 . Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons , but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus .",

  "Oberon is the second @-@ darkest large moon of Uranus after Umbriel .

Oberon is , in fact , the reddest among the major Uranian moons . Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical : the latter is much redder than the former , because it contains more dark red material . The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System . However , the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material spiraling in from outer parts of the Uranian system , possibly from irregular satellites , which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere .",

The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit — as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect — and returns them to the pitcher .

Most of the King 's Council were also present . Cranmer , who was at Lambeth Palace , was reported to have broken down in tears after telling Alexander Ales : \" She who has been the Queen of England on earth will today become a Queen in heaven . \" When the charges were first brought against Anne , Cranmer had expressed his astonishment to Henry and his belief that \" she should not be culpable . \" Still , Cranmer felt vulnerable because of his closeness to the queen , and so on the night before the execution , he declared Henry 's marriage to Anne to have been void , like Catherine 's before her . He made no serious attempt to save Anne 's life , although some sources record that he had prepared her for death by hearing her last private confession of sins , in which she had stated her innocence before God . On the day of her death , a Scottish friend found Cranmer weeping uncontrollably in his London gardens , saying that he was sure that Anne had now gone to Heaven .",

  "In the late 16th century , Lyme Regis was an important port , busier than Liverpool and one of the main links between England and mainland Europe . The combination of strong Puritan beliefs , and demands from King Charles I for ship money meant that upon the outbreak of the First English Civil War , the town was sympathetic to the Parliamentarian cause . Two local members of parliament ( MP ) , Thomas Trenchard and Walter Erle claimed Lyme Regis for the Parliamentarians in 1642 , and set about fortifying the town . Thomas Ceeley , another local MP , was assigned as governor of the town and its forces .

  "Having been officially suspended at the end of the Cromwellian regime , parliament returned after the Restoration of Charles II in 1661 . This parliament , known disparagingly as the ' Drunken Parliament ' , revoked most of the Presbyterian gains of the last thirty years . Subsequently Charles ' absence from Scotland and use of commissioners to rule his northern kingdom undermined the authority of the body . James VII 's parliament supported him against rivals and attempted rebellions , but after his escape to exile in 1689 William 's first parliament was dominated by his supporters and , in contrast to the situation in England , effectively deposed James under the Claim of Right , which offered the crown to William and Mary , placing important limitations on royal power , including the abolition of the Lords of the Articles . Rosalind Mitchison argues that the parliament became a focus of national political life , but it never reached the position of a true centre of national identity attained by its English counterpart . The new Williamite parliament would subsequently bring about its own demise by the Act of Union in 1707 . The English and Scottish parliaments were replaced by a combined Parliament of Great Britain , but it sat in Westminster and largely continued English traditions without interruption .

Louis organised a coalition against Henry , including Stephen , Eustace , Henry the Count of Champagne , and Robert the Count of Perche . Louis 's alliance was joined by Henry 's younger brother , Geoffrey , who rose in revolt , claiming that Henry had dispossessed him of his inheritance . Geoffrey of Anjou 's plans for the inheritance of his lands had been ambiguous , making the veracity of his son Geoffrey 's claims hard to assess . Contemporaneous accounts suggest he left the main castles in Poitou to Geoffrey , implying that he may have intended Henry to retain Normandy and Anjou and not Poitou .",

  "The greater adjutant ( Leptoptilos dubius ) is a member of the stork family , Ciconiidae . Its genus includes the lesser adjutant of Asia and the marabou stork of Africa . Once found widely across southern Asia , mainly in India but extending east to Borneo , the greater adjutant is now restricted to a much smaller range with only two small breeding populations ; one in India with the largest colony in Assam and the other in Cambodia .

Some cesspits leaked methane and other gases , which often caught fire and exploded , leading to loss of life , while many of the sewers were in a poor state of repair . During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners , and by 1858 many of the city 's medieval wooden water pipes were being replaced with iron ones .

In 1134 the Deputy Transport Commissioner of Zhejiang , Wu Ge , had paddle wheel warships constructed with a total of nine wheels and others with thirteen wheels . However , there were paddle wheel ships in the Song that were so large that 12 wheels were featured on each side of the vessel . In 1135 the famous general Yue Fei ( 1103 – 1142 ) ambushed a force of rebels under Yang Yao , entangling their paddle wheel craft by filling a lake with floating weeds and rotting logs , thus allowing them to board their ships and gain a strategic victory .

  "Pennsylvania 's streams have frequently flooded . According to William H.

Shank tested this idea by tabulating the highest floods on record at key points throughout the state over a 200 @-@ year period and found that a major flood had occurred , on average , once every 25 years between 1784 and 1972 .

  "The first work now generally considered as an opera is Jacopo Peri 's Dafne of 1597 , closely followed by Euridice ( 1600 ) , for which Peri and Giulio Caccini wrote separate musical settings . Ottavio Rinuccini was the librettist for both Dafne and Euridice . In the new genre a complete story was told through characters , and in addition to choruses and ensembles the vocal parts included recitative , aria and arioso . This was a development from various older forms of musical theatre that had existed since the earliest years of the Italian Renaissance ; such forms included the maschera ( \" masque \" ) , the ballo ( a dance entertainment , often with sung passages ) , and particularly the intermedio or intermezzo , a short dramatic musical episode inserted as a prologue or entr 'acte between the acts of straight plays . Another format in the later renaissance period was the torneo , or \" tournament \" , a stylised dramatic spectacle in which the main singing was performed by a narrator . Sub @-@ operatic forms of dramatic music continued to thrive as opera itself developed ; the blurred boundaries that existed for many years between these forms and \" opera \" has led to debate about how to categorise some works .

  "For more than a millennium , starting around 754 , the Papal States were territories in Italy under the direct sovereign rule of the Pope . The Catholic Church 's control over Rome and a neighbouring swathe of central Italy was generally seen as a manifestation of the Pope 's secular \" temporal \" power , as opposed to his ecclesiastical primacy . After the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 , the other main Italian states were the Kingdom of Sardinia — governed from Piedmont on the mainland by King Victor Emmanuel II — the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the south , and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in the west . The French occupation during the 1790s had led the Pope 's popularity and spiritual authority to greatly increase , but had also severely damaged the geopolitical credibility of the Papal States .

  "The first scientific reference to the coffin ray was written by English zoologist and botanist George Shaw to accompany Frederick Polydore Nodder 's illustrations of a beached fish , published in their 1795 work The Naturalist 's Miscellany . Shaw interpreted the specimen as a goosefish , calling it the \" single @-@ finned Lophius \" or Lophius monopterygius in Latin . Independently , French zoologist Auguste Duméril described a new electric ray in an 1852 volume of the journal Revue et Magasin de Zoologie , based on two specimens collected off New South Wales . He named it Hypnos subnigrum ; the genus name is derived from the Greek word for \" sleep \" , referring to the ray 's ability to induce numbness . Eventually , Gilbert Percy Whitley recognized that Nodder had illustrated the same species that Duméril had described , and thus the proper binomial name became Hypnos monopterygius . In 1902 , Edgar Ravenswood Waite proposed Hypnarce as a replacement name for Hypnos , which he believed was preoccupied by the butterfly genus Hypna . However , the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) does not seem to require the change , and thus Hypnarce is regarded as a junior synonym .",

  "Chivers believed in a close connection between poetry and God and that true poetry could only be written through divine inspiration . He once wrote : \" Poets are the apostles of divine thought , who are clothed with an authority from the Most High , to work miracles in the minds of men \" . He also wrote : \" Poetry is the power given by God to man of manifesting ... the wise relations that subsist between him and God \" , and it \" is that crystal river of the soul which runs through all the avenues of life , and after purifying the affections of the heart , empties itself into the Sea of God \" . In Nacoochee , the preface states : \" Poetry is that crystal river of the soul which runs through all the avenues of life , and after purifying the affections of the heart , empties itself into the Sea of God . \" In his introduction to Atlanta , written in 1842 but not published until 1853 , Chivers gives a lengthy discussion of his poetic theory , pre @-@ dating many ideas Poe would suggest in \" The Poetic Principle \" ( 1850 ) . Chivers , for example , suggests that poems should be short to be successful : \" No poem of any considerable length ... can be pleasing to any well @-@ educated person for any length of time \" . He also experimented with blank verse as early as 1832 and his 1853 collection , Virginalia , included mostly poems using blank verse .",
  "Stevens , Bilson , De Meo , and Dear began to pitch The Rocketeer in 1986 to the major film studios but were turned down . \" This was 1986 , long before Batman or Dick Tracy or anything similar \" , Stevens explained . \" In those days , no studio was interested at all in an expensive comic book movie .

  "Although there is no standard or official writing system for Ottawa , a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of Ottawa and Eastern Ojibwe , a collection of texts , and a descriptive grammar .

One of its goals is to promote standardization of Ottawa writing so that language learners are able to read and write in a consistent way . By comparison , folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing Ottawa based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic , and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters . While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications , its acceptance is not universal .

  "All the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M3Pn ( where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a pnictogen ) . This is due to the greater size of the P3 − and As3 − ions , so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form . These are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals : for example , potassium has nine different known phosphides , with formulae K3P , K4P3 , K5P4 , KP , K4P6 , K3P7 , K3P11 , KP10.3 , and KP15 . While most metals form arsenides , only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides . The structure of Na3As is complex with unusually short Na – Na distances of 328 – 330 pm which are shorter than in sodium metal , and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic . Other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula M3As are known , such as LiAs , which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding . The antimonides are unstable and reactive as the Sb3 − ion is a strong reducing agent ; reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine ( SbH3 ) . Bismuthides are not even wholly ionic ; they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds .",

The hosts ' team included the silver medallists in the 100 m backstroke and breaststroke , and their butterflyer had come fifth ; their freestyler would come fourth in his event .

  "Before his departure from Germany , Hess had given his adjutant , Karlheinz Pintsch , a letter addressed to Hitler that detailed his intentions to open peace negotiations with the British . Pintsch delivered the letter to Hitler at the Berghof around noon on 11 May . Albert Speer later said Hitler described Hess 's departure as one of the worst personal blows of his life , as he considered it a personal betrayal . Hitler worried that his allies , Italy and Japan , would perceive Hess 's act as an attempt by Hitler to secretly open peace negotiations with the British . For this reason , Hitler ordered that the German press should characterise Hess as a madman who made the decision to fly to Scotland entirely on his own , without Hitler 's knowledge or authority . Some members of the government , including Göring and Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels , believed this only made matters worse , because if Hess truly were mentally ill , he should not have been holding an important government position . Hitler stripped Hess of all of his party and state offices , and secretly ordered him shot on sight if he ever returned to Germany . He abolished the post of Deputy Führer , assigning Hess 's former duties to Bormann , with the title of Head of the Party Chancellery . Hitler initiated Aktion Hess , a flurry of hundreds of arrests of astrologers , faith healers and occultists that took place around 9 June . The campaign was part of a propaganda effort by Goebbels and others to denigrate Hess and to make scapegoats of occult practitioners .",

  "Horses are not native to Cumberland Island . Popular myth states they were brought to the island by the Spanish in the 16th century . However , it is believed that these first horses more than likely did not survive due to the lack of visits made by the Spanish and the local Native Americans on the island finding them of little practical use . In the 18th century , the English began settling Cumberland Island . The horses seen there today are most likely descendants of horses brought by these settlers , as this is when a large majority of the horses began to roam freely and revert to their natural state , becoming feral . During the 19th century , efforts were made to capture and make use of the horses . The first attempts were made by the island plantation owner Robert Stafford , who allowed visitors to purchase and capture the horses , which Stafford called \" marsh tackies , \" for their own personal use . The horses were next used as cavalry animals during the American Civil War . After the war , records suggest that people from Jekyll Island captured some of the horses for horse meat . Around 1881 , Thomas M. Carnegie bought two plantations on the island and introduced Tennessee Walking Horses , Paso Finos , and Arabians into the feral horse population in an attempt to improve the animals . Carnegie received a small amount of income from the buying and selling of these animals . Later , many island residents began introducing additional breeds into the herds on the island , further diversifying the bands of horses . In 1921 , a large number of horses were brought onto the island from Globe , Arizona , all of which had been running wild on western rangeland .",

  "Scottish privateers and pirates preyed on shipping in the North Sea and off the Atlantic coast of France . Scotland 's Admiralty court judged whether a captured ship was a lawful prize and dealt with the recovery of goods . As the court was entitled to a tenth of the value of a prize , it was a profitable business for the admiral . The privateers Andrew and Robert Barton were still using their letters of reprisal of 1506 against the Portuguese in 1561 . The Bartons operated down the east coast of Britain from Leven and the Firth of Forth , while others used the French Channel ports such as Rouen and Dieppe or the Atlantic port of Brest as bases . During the Rough Wooing in 1542 , the Mary Willoughby , the Lion , and the Salamander under the command of John Barton , son of Robert Barton , attacked merchants and fishermen off Whitby .

  "However , there is no precise point at which an object can be said to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium . As Soter noted in his article , \" how are we to quantify the degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet ? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent ? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and nonround shapes , so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice . \" Furthermore , the point at which an object 's mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object . Objects made of ices , such as Enceladus and Miranda , assume that state more easily than those made of rock , such as Vesta and Pallas . Heat energy , from gravitational collapse , impacts , tidal forces , or radioactive decay , also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not ; Saturn 's icy moon Mimas is ellipsoidal , but Neptune 's larger moon Proteus , which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun , is irregular . In addition , the much larger Iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have the dimensions expected for its current speed of rotation , indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but no longer is .",

  "The nucleolus is a discrete densely stained structure found in the nucleus . It is not surrounded by a membrane , and is sometimes called a suborganelle . It forms around tandem repeats of rDNA , DNA coding for ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) . These regions are called nucleolar organizer regions ( NOR ) . The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and assemble ribosomes . The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity , as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components , facilitating further ribosomal assembly , and hence further association . This model is supported by observations that inactivation of rDNA results in intermingling of nucleolar structures .",

  "A bill in the accounts of 11 April 1717 for \" repairing the globes in the library \" is the earliest reference to the Middle Temple 's ownership of the Molyneux terrestrial and celestial globes . Markham 's view was that Robert Ashley ( 1565 – 1641 ) , a barrister of the Middle Temple who was also an ardent geographer , was likely to have left the globes to the Inn in his will , together with his books . Ashley 's books formed the nucleus of the Inn 's original library and included copies of the second edition of Hues ' Tractatus de Globis and other works on cosmography . On the other hand , Wallis has said that Markham 's view is not supported by any available evidence and the globes are not mentioned in the will . She believes that they were probably acquired by Middle Temple on their publication in 1603 .",

  "Even though Brauchitsch was in charge of operational affairs during the Polish and French campaigns , he had very little influence , as a whole , as to the war 's progress . During the invasion of Poland , he oversaw most plans . The campaign was often cited as the first example of \" blitzkrieg \" . Blitzkrieg was not a theory or an official doctrine . The Polish Campaign did not resemble the popular perception of what became known as blitzkrieg . The Panzer Divisions were spread thinly among the infantry and were not granted operational independence or grouped en masse , as they would in Western Europe . The operative method of the Wehrmacht in Poland followed the more traditional Vernichtungsgedanke . What is commonly referred to as blitzkrieg did not develop until after the campaign in the west in June 1940 . It was not the cause but rather the consequence of victory . Brauchitsch himself had to be convinced that armour could act independently at the operational level , before the campaign .",

  "In 1911 Brooks became romantically involved with Ida Rubinstein , an actress and dancer formerly with Serge Diaghilev 's Ballets Russes . D 'Annunzio had an obsessive but unrequited attraction to her as well . Rubinstein was deeply in love with Brooks ; she wanted to buy a farm in the country where they could live alone together — a mode of life in which Brooks had no interest . Although they broke up in 1914 , Brooks painted Rubinstein more often than any other subject ; for Brooks , Rubinstein 's \" fragile and androgynous beauty \" represented an aesthetic ideal . The earliest of these paintings are a series of allegorical nudes . In The Crossing ( also exhibited as The Dead Woman ) , Rubinstein appears as a corpse , stretched on a white bed or bier against a black void ; in Spring , she strews flowers on the ground in a grassy meadow . When Rubinstein starred in D 'Annunzio 's play The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian , Brooks painted her as Saint Sebastian — tied to a post , being shot with an arrow by a masked dwarf standing on a table . The dwarf is thought to represent D 'Annunzio .",

In his study on 17th @-@ century Dutch art and culture , Simon Schama remarks that \" it can never be overemphasized that the period between 1550 and 1650 , when the political identity of an independent Netherlands nation was being established , was also a time of dramatic physical alteration of its landscape \" .

  "While at Magdalen College , Wilde became particularly well known for his role in the aesthetic and decadent movements . He wore his hair long , openly scorned \" manly \" sports though he occasionally boxed , and decorated his rooms with peacock feathers , lilies , sunflowers , blue china and other objets d 'art , once remarking to friends whom he entertained lavishly , \" I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china . \" The line quickly became famous , accepted as a slogan by aesthetes but used against them by critics who sensed in it a terrible vacuousness . Some elements disdained the aesthetes , but their languishing attitudes and showy costumes became a recognised pose . Wilde was once physically attacked by a group of four fellow students , and dealt with them single @-@ handedly , surprising critics . By his third year Wilde had truly begun to create himself and his myth , and saw his learning developing in much larger ways than merely the prescribed texts . This attitude resulted in his being rusticated for one term , when he nonchalantly returned to college late from a trip to Greece with Prof. Mahaffy .",
  "Other poets from whom critics believe Thomas drew influence include James Joyce , Arthur Rimbaud and D. H. Lawrence . William York Tindall , in his 1962 study , A Reader 's Guide to Dylan Thomas , finds comparison between Thomas 's and Joyce 's wordplay , while he notes the themes of rebirth and nature are common to the works of Lawrence and Thomas . Although Thomas described himself as the \" Rimbaud of Cwmdonkin Drive \" , he stated that the phrase \" Swansea 's Rimbaud \" was coined by poet Roy Campbell . Critics have explored the connection between the creation of Thomas 's mythological pasts into his works such as \" The Orchards \" , which Ann Elizabeth Mayer believes reflects the Welsh myths of the Mabinogion . Thomas 's poetry is notable for its musicality , most clear in \" Fern Hill \" , \" In Country Sleep \" , \" Ballad of the Long @-@ legged Bait \" and \" In the White Giant 's Thigh \" from Under Milk Wood .",

  "Ācārya Amṛtacandra has described as to how the consequences of violence ( karmas attracted ) differ from person to persons for similar and different types of acts . A small violence may bring serious consequences to one person , while to another person grievous violence may bring about lesser consequences . For instance , a person hunting and killing only one small animal suffers severe consequences while a person who is building a temple or hospital suffers milder karmic consequences even though its construction kills many animals . Even when violence is jointly committed by two persons , the same act may result in severe consequence for one person and mild consequence for another person . This may happen in the case where the leader and planner of violence binds severe karmas , while a follower binds much lesser karmas . One who actually does not commit violence may be responsible for hiṃsā while one who actually commits violence is not responsible for hiṃsā . For instance , a burglar who fails in his robbery is still a felon but a diligent surgeon who is trying to save a patient is not responsible for violence even if a patient dies during the surgery . Persons who have not committed violence may become responsible for violence committed by others . This may happen when a violence which is carried out by someone is approved and instigated by someone else . Ahimsa often gives result of himsa to one and himsa may sometimes give result of ahimsa to another . For instance , one person saves another from oppression by use of violence and hence enjoys consequences of ahimsa although resorting to violence , while another does not act to save someone wishing that the other person is not saved and thus suffers the consequences of violence although he may have not actually done anything .",

  "Engine failure causes problems on conventional subsonic aircraft ; not only does the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag , causing the aircraft to yaw and bank in the direction of the failed engine . If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds , it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe . Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems , in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties . During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero so , on Concorde , engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary spill door and the full extension of the ramps , which deflected the air downwards past the engine , gaining lift and minimising drag . Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure .",

Though The Sleeping Dragon benefited commercially from being released on console as well as PC , this approach required certain development compromises as the PC version was held back by the constraints of the console versions . As a result , The Angel of Death was written for PC only \" so as to really push the boundaries in terms of the technology and graphics . \" As a series ' first , Revolution was not the only developer , but was co @-@ developed by Revolution and Sumo Digital . Cecil believed that because of the requirement for ever larger team sizes , it was no longer possible to maintain a large development team to write single original titles , resulting in Revolution closed the production side in order to concentrate on design , and Sumo to concentrate on production . It is the first game to be amBX enabled . Broken Sword : The Sleeping Dragon was criticised for featuring a high number of action elements . Cecil stated that he aimed to put the player under pressure . While he still stood behind this principle , he thought the action elements were not the right approach . The Sleeping Dragon was also criticised for using a high number of crate puzzles , resulting in Cecil reducing the number of them . The music in the game was composed by Ben McCullough and features tracks by Übernoise . While Rolf Saxon returns to voice George Stobbart , Nicole \" Nico \" Collard was this time played by Katherine Pageon .",

  "To make the Eastern Spirit roll realistically in the storm , the developers had to write a completely new program . They found that making the ship move was easy , but getting it to respond to storm conditions was much more complex . As such , they created a complete roll editor , called the Darkwave editor , which allowed them to control the pitch ( when the ship moves on the horizontal axis ) and the roll ( when it moves on the vertical axis ) separately . The combination of moving the ship on both axes allowed the developers to create realistic ship movements . This in turn allowed them to time the exact movement of the ship to coincide with what was happening in the game without having to use a cutscene . However , creating such a realistic movement system led to camera problems . According to programmer , Claude Levastre , early in development , \" the camera was constantly going through the walls because of the roll movement . So we had to develop an inertia @-@ control system for the camera , just as if a cameraman is using a steadicam behind the hero . \" Another change brought about by the ship 's motion was that initially , the movement patterns of inanimate objects on the ship were scripted , but this was later replaced with real physics .",

  "The parsnip is a biennial plant with a rosette of roughly hairy leaves that has a pungent odor when crushed . Parsnips are grown for their fleshy , edible , cream @-@ colored taproots . The roots are generally smooth , although lateral roots sometimes form . Most are cylindrical , but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape , which generally tends to be favored by food processors as it is more resistant to breakage . The plant 's apical meristem produces a rosette of pinnate leaves , each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins . The lower leaves have short stems , the upper ones are stemless , and the terminal leaves have three lobes . The leaves are once- or twice @-@ pinnate with broad , ovate , sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins ; they grow up to 40 cm ( 16 in ) long . The petioles are grooved and have sheathed bases . The floral stem develops in the second year and can grow to more than 150 cm ( 60 in ) tall . It is hairy , grooved , hollow ( except at the nodes ) , and sparsely branched . It has a few stalkless , single @-@ lobed leaves measuring 5 to 10 cm ( 2 to 4 in ) long that are arranged in opposite pairs .",

Mikhail Kutuzov was appointed as his replacement . In a final attempt to save Moscow , the Russians made a stand near the village of Borodino , west of the town of Mozhaysk . They fortified their positions and waited for the French to attack . The Russian right wing occupied ideal defensive terrain , so the French tried to press the Russian left for much of the battle .

The French managed to capture this redoubt late into the day , gradually forcing the rest of the Russian army to pull back as well . The Russians suffered terrible casualties during the fighting , losing over a third of their army .

  "Athenian slaves were the property of their master ( or of the state ) , who could dispose of them as he saw fit . He could give , sell , rent , or bequeath them . A slave could have a spouse and children , but the slave family was not recognized by the state , and the master could scatter the family members at any time . Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings . A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave ; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma . With several minor exceptions , the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture . Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master . A famous example of trusty slave was Themistocles 's Persian slave Sicinnus ( the counterpart of Ephialtes of Trachis ) , who , despite his Persian origin , betrayed Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis . Despite torture in trials , the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way : if he was mistreated , the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest ( δίκη βλάβης / dikē blabēs ) . Conversely , a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen ( γραφὴ ὕβρεως / graphē hybreōs ) ; this was not enacted for the sake of the slave , but to avoid violent excess ( ὕβρις / hubris ) .",

  "The past fifty years have seen a major change , and academic critics have acknowledged the play as a powerful and original work . Norman Holland 's widely influential proposal in 1959 of a \" right way / wrong way \" reading took Wycherley 's morality with innovative seriousness and interpreted the play as presenting two bad kinds of masculinity – Horner 's libertinism and Pinchwife 's possessiveness – and recommending the golden mean of Harcourt , the true lover , the representative of mutual trust in marriage . A competing milestone approach of the same generation is that of Rose Zimbardo ( 1965 ) , who discusses the play in generic and historical terms as a fierce social satire .",

  "American traders developed the \" Golden Round \" trade route around the world . Ships sailed from Boston to the Pacific via Cape Horn , then to the North West Coast , arriving in the spring or early summer . They would spend the summer and early autumn fur trading on the coast , mainly between Sitka and the Columbia River . In late autumn they sailed to the Hawaiian Islands , where they typically spent the winter , then from Hawaii to Macau on the Pearl River Delta , arriving in autumn . Trading in Canton did not begin until November , when tea shipments were ready . The Americans had to hire pilots to take their ships up the Pearl River to Canton 's \" outport \" of Whampoa . Foreign ships were not allowed in Canton itself . Trading took weeks or months , after which the ships were loaded with Chinese goods such as teas , silks , porcelains , sugar , cassia , and curios . They left in the winter and used the northeasterly monsoon winds of the South China Sea to reach the Sunda Strait , then used the southeasterly trade winds to cross the Indian Ocean to the Cape of Good Hope . From there the ships sailed to Boston , where they traditionally docked at the India Wharf . Frederic William Howay described this as the \" golden round \" , writing : The Americans had a perfect golden round of profits : first , the profit on the original cargo of trading goods when exchanged for furs ; second , the profit when the furs were transmuted into Chinese goods ; and , third , the profit on those goods when they reached America . In the later years of the North West Trade the pattern became more complex as additional markets and side voyages were incorporated .",

Following the war , at least one Filipino American , Augustin Feliciano , continued to serve in the U.S. Navy .

  "The Sun is a population I star ; it has a higher abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium ( \" metals \" in astronomical parlance ) than the older population II stars . Elements heavier than hydrogen and helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars , so the first generation of stars had to die before the Universe could be enriched with these atoms . The oldest stars contain few metals , whereas stars born later have more . This high metallicity is thought to have been crucial to the Sun 's development of a planetary system because the planets form from the accretion of \" metals \" .",

  "The 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm projectile potentially poses less risk of collateral damage than conventional pistol bullets , because the projectile design limits overpenetration , as well as risk of ricochet . The lightweight projectile also poses less risk of collateral damage in the event of a miss , because it loses much of its kinetic energy after traveling only 400 m ( 440 yd ) , whereas a conventional pistol bullet such as the 9 × 19mm retains significant energy beyond 800 m ( 870 yd ) . This range exceeds the engagement distances expected for the 5 @.@ 7 × 28mm cartridge 's intended applications , so the cartridge 's limited energy at long range is not considered to be disadvantageous .

To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands , Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies . This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces — a series of Anglo @-@ Dutch Wars — which would eventually strengthen England 's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch . In 1655 , England annexed the island of Jamaica from the Spanish , and in 1666 succeeded in colonising the Bahamas .",

This meant that they were \" capable of asserting themselves among the ship @-@ owners and county governors in the board \" of the Norwegian Peace Association .

He wanted to tie the \" apolitical \" peace movement closer to the labour movement , to create \" economic justice \" and to employ the use of arbitration in labour conflicts . These goals were not embraced by all of the members , particularly not those who wanted to keep the Peace Association politically neutral . A larger problem , however , was that Koht rated Norwegian nationalism higher than pacifism . He had thus carried out his compulsory military service \" with fervor \" , notes Agøy . Koht demanded that the Peace Association did not resist to an armed defense of the \" fatherland \" . The national convention in 1902 refused to acknowledge this principle , and Koht therefore resigned his membership .

  "Von Helversen and Heller argued that none of the old names now considered synonyms of M. mystacinus could apply to M. alcathoe , because these names all have their type localities in western or central Europe . However , the more recent discovery of M. alcathoe further to the west renders it possible that an older name may be discovered . In addition , Russian researcher Suren Gazaryan has suggested that the name caucasicus Tsytsulina , 2000 ( originally proposed for a subspecies of M. mystacinus from the Caucasus ) may prove to be applicable to M. alcathoe ; in that case , the species would be renamed Myotis caucasicus .

  "The processive polyadenylation complex in the nucleus of eukaryotes works on products of RNA polymerase II , such as precursor mRNA . Here , a multi @-@ protein complex ( see components on the right ) cleaves the 3 ' -most part of a newly produced RNA and polyadenylates the end produced by this cleavage . The cleavage is catalysed by the enzyme CPSF and occurs 10 – 30 nucleotides downstream of its binding site . This site often has the polyadenylation signal sequence AAUAAA on the RNA , but variants of it that bind more weakly to CPSF exist . Two other proteins add specificity to the binding to an RNA : CstF and CFI . CstF binds to a GU @-@ rich region further downstream of CPSF 's site . CFI recognises a third site on the RNA ( a set of UGUAA sequences in mammals ) and can recruit CPSF even if the AAUAAA sequence is missing . The polyadenylation signal – the sequence motif recognised by the RNA cleavage complex – varies between groups of eukaryotes . Most human polyadenylation sites contain the AAUAAA sequence , but this sequence is less common in plants and fungi .",

A distinction was made between pathos ( plural pathe ) which is normally translated as passion , propathos or instinctive reaction ( e.g. , turning pale and trembling when confronted by physical danger ) and eupathos , which is the mark of the Stoic sage ( sophos ) .

Brown dwarfs form like stars from the direct collapse of clouds of gas and this formation mechanism also produces objects that are below the 13 MJup limit and can be as low as 1 MJup .

  "A commonly used defence for the torts of trespass against the person is that of volenti non fit injuria , or consent . If a claimant participates in a sporting activity in which physical contact is ordinary conduct , such as rugby , they are considered to have consented . This is not the case if the physical contact went beyond what could be expected , as in R v Billinghurst , or where the injuries were suffered not from the claimant 's participation in the sport but inadequate safety measures taken , as in Watson v British Boxing Board of Control . The same general rule applies to people who voluntarily take part in fights , although only if the injuries caused are proportionate , as in Lane v Holloway . If the claimant is informed by a doctor of the broad risks of a medical procedure , there will be no claim under trespass against the person for resulting harm caused ; the claimant 's agreement constitutes \" real consent \" , as in Chatterton v Gerson . Consent for medical procedures is different in cases where the claimant does not have the mental capacity to consent . In F v West Berkshire Health Authority , it was held that in such situations the requirements are that there \" must be a necessity to act when it is not practical to communicate with the assisted person ... [ and ] the action taken must be such as a reasonable person would in all the circumstances take , acting in the best interests of the assisted person \" .",

The resolve of the South Vietnamese , Montagnard CIDG soldiers in particular , had apparently been shaken and they disobeyed an order to carry out a sweep operation at the rear end of the camp , and their Vietnamese commander even refused to leave his bunker to encourage the soldiers .

  "Sheep are flock animals and strongly gregarious ; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies . The dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species . Furthermore , in contrast to the red deer and gazelle ( two other ungulates of primary importance to meat production in prehistoric times ) , sheep do not defend territories although they do form home ranges . All sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock , although this behavior varies with breed , and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members . During flocking , sheep have a strong tendency to follow and a leader may simply be the first individual to move . Relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep : in mixed @-@ breed flocks , subgroups of the same breed tend to form , and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks . Sheep can become hefted to one particular local pasture ( heft ) so they do not roam freely in unfenced landscapes . Lambs learn the heft from ewes and if whole flocks are culled it must be retaught to the replacement animals .",

Playford accused the High Court of Australia of helping the federal parliament under Curtin to legislate to give itself a monopoly on the acquisition of income tax , which he claimed was contrary to the intention of the constitution to prevent excessive centralisation of power in the federal government .

  "In 1971 , Erik Hornung published a study rebutting these views . He points out that in any given period many deities , even minor ones , were described as superior to all others . He also argues that the unspecified \" god \" in the wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity the reader chooses to revere . Although the combinations , manifestations , and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting , they were always restricted to a finite number of forms , never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or pantheistic way . Henotheism , Hornung says , describes Egyptian religion better than other labels . An Egyptian could worship any deity at a particular time and credit it with supreme power in that moment , without denying the other gods or merging them all with the god that he or she focused on . Hornung concludes that the gods were fully unified only in myth , at the time before creation , after which the multitude of gods emerged from a uniform nonexistence .",

Although John was less well known , his acting skills were considerable and would flourish after January 1697 in the cooperative company , where commentators even started to compare him with the great Betterton . Verbruggen was considered a more natural , intuitive or \" careless \" actor , with \" a negligent agreeable wildness in his action and his mien , which became him well . \" Anthony Aston vividly described Verbruggen as \" a little in @-@ kneed , which gave him a shambling gait , which was a carelessness , and became him . \" Modern critics do not find the Loveless part very lively or irresistible , but Vanbrugh was able to count on Verbruggen 's shambling male magnetism and \" agreeable wildness \" to enrich the character . This would originally have worked even in print , since cast lists were included in the published plays : most 1690s play readers were playgoers also , and aware of the high @-@ profile Verbruggens .

  "The characters Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe are revealed to be Avatars through the usage of their supernatural powers ; however , viewers did not find it immediately apparent whether a suspected Avatar served as good or evil . The series gave clues , such as depicting the Creatures of Darkness with coal @-@ black eyes ( according to Daniel Knauf , Creatures of Light have an invisible aura ) . An Avatar 's nature is determined by the type and application of his powers . As the Pitch Document states , Avatars draw their talents and powers from the same pool . These abilities may vary in type and strength , and include but are not limited to the manipulation and transfer of life force , spiritual healings , telekinesis and telepathy , and granting small measures of powers to a mortal . Although the series showed the powers of Ben and Brother Justin , reviewers were still unsure about the main characters ' Avataric nature by the end of the first season . When Ben 's good nature and Justin 's dark heritage became clearer in Season 2 , reviewers began to describe Carnivàle 's underlying message as \" essentially the opposite of spiritual belief : fatalism \" . Daniel Knauf disputed any theory of determinism , and repeatedly pointed to the characters ' free will to overcome their destiny . Free choice allows the story to portray Avatars as deliberately not making use of their powers or as acting contrary to their nature ; an Avatar would however still have to put consistent effort into not lapsing back into his defined moral behavior .",

  "The developers felt that creating another game in the series with the same style of gameplay had limited potential . In an attempt to imbue the game with the feel of a horror film where the protagonist is a regular person and the antagonist is powerful , they avoided the common survival horror gameplay feature of a player character who is skilled in the use of weapons . Instead they generated an unarmed player character ; and examined the survival horror gameplay staple of difficult combat and sluggish opponents , inspired by zombie films and modelled after the video games Alone in the Dark ( 1992 ) and Resident Evil ( 1996 ) . They also analyzed around 50 chase sequences from various films , including horror films , and the structure of slasher films , in which a powerful and intelligent antagonist pursues the protagonists . The developers drew inspiration from common childhood nightmares about running away from an unknown threat , and decided to incorporate an intelligent enemy capable of trailing and outrunning the protagonist . The chase sequences were designed to evoke a brief sense of tension and fright for the player , although the developers did not want to prolong the tension with the constant presence of monsters , and were concerned that this would become overwhelming and spoil the player 's immersion in the game and interest in the story .

  "Andronikos I was the last of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople , although his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204 . Nevertheless , Andronikos 's role in the collapse of the empire is controversial ; historians disagree over the extent to which his brief reign influenced events after his death . Andonikos 's coup , together with his violent death , had weakened the dynastic continuity and solidarity on which the strength of the Byzantine state had come to rely . Furthermore , his so @-@ called ' anti @-@ Latin ' policy has been criticised by some historians as a failure , in view of the increasing hostility it caused towards Byzantium in the west . In particular , Andonikos 's failure to prevent the massacre of Latins in Constantinople in 1182 has been seen as especially significant , since henceforth Byzantine foreign policy was invariably perceived as sinister and anti @-@ Latin in the west .

Brandt ( 1855 ) was the first to propose dividing Rodentia into three suborders , Sciuromorpha , Hystricomorpha and Myomorpha , based on the development of certain muscles in the jaw and this system was widely accepted .

  "Apeomyoides is a member of the Eomyidae , a diverse rodent family that is now extinct . Eomyids first appeared in the Middle Eocene ( ~ 47 million years ago , mya ) in North America , where they existed until the end of the Miocene ( ~ 5 mya ) . In Europe , they survived a little longer , until the end of the Pliocene ( ~ 2 – 3 mya ) . Apeomyoides is further part of a distinctive subgroup of eomyids known as the Apeomyinae . The first apeomyine to be discovered was Apeomys tuerkheimae , named in 1968 based on fossils from the Early Miocene of Germany , and later discoveries have expanded the range of Apeomys and similar taxa . In 1998 , Oldřich Fejfar and colleagues reviewed Apeomys and identified a second , related genus Megapeomys , from the Early Miocene of Germany , the Czech Republic , and Japan . These scientists also named a new eomyid subfamily , Apeomyinae , to house Apeomys and Megapeomys . The Japanese Megapeomys was named as a separate species , Megapeomys repenningi , in 2011 . Further apeomyines have been identified in North America : Megapeomys bobwilsoni from the Hemingfordian of Nevada , Apeomyoides savagei from the Barstovian of Nevada , Zophoapeomys indicum from the Late Oligocene of South Dakota , and a possible second species of Zophoapeomys from the Late Oligocene of Nebraska .

  "\" Blame It on Lisa \" was met with negative reception in Brazil shortly after its broadcast in the United States . According to The Washington Post , \" an immediate media frenzy was born \" as the episode started receiving coverage in local newspapers and news programs on Brazilian television . An article published in the Houston Chronicle on April 8 , 2002 stated that critics in the country were upset by the inclusion of clichés and stereotypes not related to Brazil , such as Brazilians having Spanish accents and wearing mustaches . The general Brazilian perception was that the episode mixed up their culture with that of surrounding Spanish @-@ speaking Latin American countries . Alex Bellos , The Guardian 's correspondent in Brazil , commented that one of the things upsetting the Brazilians was the many inaccuracies featured in the episode , such as the conga and the macarena being popular dances in Brazil ; the conga is actually a Caribbean dance , and the macarena does not come from Brazil nor is it frequently performed there .",

  "As of April 2008 , 38 species are considered by the IUCN to be near threatened or worse and therefore at risk of extinction . Antbirds are neither targeted by the pet trade nor large enough to be hunted ; the principal cause of the decline in antbird species is habitat loss . The destruction or modification of forests has several effects on different species of antbirds . The fragmentation of forests into smaller patches affects species that are averse to crossing gaps as small as roads . If these species become locally extinct in a fragment , this reluctance to cross unforested barriers makes their re @-@ establishment unlikely . Smaller forest fragments are unable to sustain mixed @-@ species feeding flocks , leading to local extinctions . Another risk faced by antbirds in fragmented habitat is increased nest predation . An unplanned experiment in fragmentation occurred on Barro Colorado Island , a former hill in Panama that became an isolated island during the flooding caused by the creation of the Panama Canal . Numerous species of antbird formerly resident in the area were extirpated , in no small part due to increased levels of nest predation on the island . While the species lost from Barro Colorado are not globally threatened , they illustrate the vulnerability of species in fragmented habitats and help explain the declines of some species . The majority of threatened species have very small natural ranges . Some are also extremely poorly known ; for example the Rio de Janeiro antwren is known only from a single specimen collected in 1982 , although there have been unconfirmed reports since 1994 and it is currently listed as critically endangered . Additionally , new species are discovered at regular intervals ; the Caatinga antwren was described in 2000 , the acre antshrike in 2004 , the sincorá antwren in 2007 , and the description of a relative of the Paraná antwren discovered in 2005 in the outskirts of São Paulo is being prepared . While not yet scientifically described , conservation efforts have already been necessary , as the site of discovery was set out to be flooded to form a reservoir . Consequently , 72 individuals were captured and transferred to another locality .",

  "In \" Fan Fare \" , Waugh forecasts that his future books will be unpopular because of their religious theme . On publication in 1950 , Helena was received indifferently by the public and by critics , who disparaged the awkward mixing of 20th century schoolgirl slang with otherwise reverential prose . Otherwise , Waugh 's prediction proved unfounded ; all his fiction remained in print and sales stayed healthy . During his successful 1957 lawsuit against the Daily Express , Waugh 's counsel produced figures showing total sales to that time of over four million books , two thirds in Britain and the rest in America . Men at Arms , the first volume of his war trilogy , won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1953 ; initial critical comment was lukewarm , with Connolly likening Men at Arms to beer rather than champagne . Connolly changed his view later , calling the completed trilogy \" the finest novel to come out of the war \" . Of Waugh 's other major postwar works , the Knox biography was admired within Waugh 's close circle but criticised by others in the Church for its depiction of Knox as an unappreciated victim of the Catholic hierarchy . The book did not sell well — \" like warm cakes \" , according to Waugh . Pinfold surprised the critics by its originality .

  "Aristotle and Pliny relate the legend of a contest amongst the birds to see who should be their king , the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest . Initially , it looked as though the eagle would win easily , but as he began to tire , a small bird which had hidden under the eagle 's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title . Following from this legend , in much European folklore the wren has been described as the \" king of the birds \" or as a flame bearer . However , these terms were also applied to the Regulus species , the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles , and , because of the legend 's reference to the \" smallest of birds \" becoming king , the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren . The confusion was assisted by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Ancient Greek words for the wren ( βασιλεύς basileus , \" king \" ) and the crests ( βασιλισκος basiliskos , \" kinglet \" ) . In English , the association between the firecrest and Eurasian wren was reinforced by the kinglet 's old name of \" fire @-@ crested wren \" .",

  "In Japan , a geisha was paid for the number of senkodokei ( incense sticks ) that had been consumed while she was present , a practice which continued until 1924 . Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock ; while religious purposes were of primary importance , these clocks were also popular at social gatherings , and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals . The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which incense was placed . These clocks were common in China , but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan . To signal the passage of a specific amount of time , small pieces of fragrant woods , resins , or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails . Different powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense , depending on how the clock was laid out . The length of the trail of incense , directly related to the size of the seal , was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last ; all burned for long periods of time , ranging between 12 hours and a month .",
