Ross had long been an admirer of Franklin , and wanted to see him on a coin . Mint officials had considered putting Franklin on the dime in 1941 , but the project was shelved owing to heavy demands on the Mint for coins as the United States entered World War II . During the war , the Mint contemplated adding one or more new denominations of coinage ; Sinnock prepared a Franklin design in anticipation of a new issue , which did not occur .

  "Nuptial flight occurs throughout the year in humid and warm climates . The alates begin to emerge from their nest and immediately climb onto tall structures ( such as tree trunks of fence @-@ posts ) where they begin to fly and copulate . Depending on the species , a queen either mates with a single male or with multiple males . Observations show that meat ant males begin to fly first , followed by the queens .

After mating , the males soon die and the queens proceed to search for a suitable nest to establish her colony . Finding a location to nest is dangerous , as birds and other ants prey on them ; disease and starvation are other causes of death in queens . While most queens will establish a nest by herself , nests can be established when queens cooperate with each other , are adopted into an existing colony , or by \" budding \" ( also called \" satelliting \" or \" fractionating \" ) , where a subset of the colony including queens , workers and brood ( eggs , larvae and pupae ) leave the main colony for an alternative nest site . 10 % of queens will cooperate with another queen during colony foundation .",

  "At the story 's climax , Gawain is wounded superficially in the neck by the Green Knight 's axe . During the medieval period , the body and the soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin . The neck , specifically , was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to will , connecting the reasoning part ( the head ) and the courageous part ( the heart ) . Gawain 's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage . By accepting the girdle from the lady , he employs reason to do something less than courageous — evade death in a dishonest way . Gawain 's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound . The Green Knight 's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along : the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain , rather than submitting his will in humility to God . The Green Knight , by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot , also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot , and therefore all of humanity . However , the wounds of Christ , believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies , are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful \" stiffneckedness \" will be healed among fallen mortals .",

  "During Fellini 's early film career , he was closely associated with the movement known as neorealism , a set of films produced by the Italian film industry during the post @-@ World War II period , particularly 1945 – 1952 , and characterized by close attention to social context , a sense of historical immediacy , political commitment to progressive social change , and an anti @-@ Fascist ideology . Although there were glimpses of certain lapses in neorealistic orthodoxy in some of his first films as a director , La Strada has been widely viewed as a definitive break with the ideological demands of neorealist theorists to follow a particular political slant or embody a specific \" realist \" style . This resulted in certain critics vilifying Fellini for , as they saw it , reverting to prewar attitudes of individualism , mysticism and preoccupation with \" pure style \" . Fellini vigorously responded to this criticism : \" Certain people still think neorealism is fit to show only certain kinds of reality , and they insist that this is social reality . It is a program , to show only certain aspects of life \" . Film critic Millicent Marcus wrote that , \" La Strada remains a film indifferent to the social and historical concerns of orthodox neorealism \" . Soon , other Italian filmmakers , including Michelangelo Antonioni and even Fellini 's mentor and early collaborator Roberto Rossellini were to follow Fellini 's lead and , in the words of critic Peter Bondanella , \" pass beyond a dogmatic approach to social reality , dealing poetically with other equally compelling personal or emotional problems \" . As film scholar Mark Shiel has pointed out , when it won the first Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1956 , La Strada became the first film to win international success as an example of a new brand of neorealism , \" bittersweet and self @-@ conscious \" .",

  "Using John Wisdom 's parable of the invisible gardener , Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable . The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island ; one believes it is tended to by a gardener , the other believes that it formed naturally , without the existence of a gardener . The two watch out for the gardener but never find him ; the non @-@ believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener , whereas the believer rationalises the non @-@ appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected . Flew contended that if the believer 's interpretation is accepted , nothing is left of the original gardener . He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence ; and these beliefs consequently suffer a \" death by a thousand qualifications \" as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful . Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God 's love for humans , arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs . He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God , such as the terminal illness of a child , theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence ; for example they may suggest that God 's love is different from human love . Such qualifications , Flew argued , make the original proposition meaningless ; he questioned what God 's love actually promises and what it guarantees against , and proposed that God 's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless .",

  "The Treehouse of Horror episodes are difficult for both the writers and the animators . The episodes were originally written at the beginning of the production run , but in later seasons they were written at the end and aired at the beginning of the next season as holdovers , giving the animators more time to work . Part of the difficulty for the animators is that the episodes always involve many complex backgrounds , new characters , and new designs . They are difficult for the writers because they must produce three stories , an opening and , in the early episodes , a wraparound . They would have to try to fit all of this into a 20 – 22 minute episode . The episodes often go through many last minute changes , with rewrites requiring new lines to be recorded . \" Treehouse of Horror III \" in particular underwent somewhere between 80 and 100 line changes in the six @-@ week period between the arrival of the animation from Korea and the airing of the episode . By the fourth season , executive producers Al Jean and Mike Reiss were less enamored of Treehouse of Horror episodes and considered dropping them , but the other writers insisted that they be kept .",

  "In addition to the Song gentry 's antiquarian pursuits of art collecting , scholar @-@ officials during the Song became highly interested in retrieving ancient relics from archaeological sites , in order to revive the use of ancient vessels in ceremonies of state ritual . Scholar @-@ officials of the Song period claimed to have discovered ancient bronze vessels that were created as far back as the Shang dynasty ( 1600 – 1046 BCE ) , which bore the written characters of the Shang era . Some attempted to recreate these bronze vessels by using imagination alone , not by observing tangible evidence of relics ; this practice was criticized by Shen Kuo in his work of 1088 . Yet Shen Kuo had much more to criticize than this practice alone . Shen objected to the idea of his peers that ancient relics were products created by famous \" sages \" in lore or the ancient aristocratic class ; Shen rightfully attributed the discovered handicrafts and vessels from ancient times as the work of artisans and commoners from previous eras . He also disapproved of his peers ' pursuit of archaeology simply to enhance state ritual , since Shen not only took an interdisciplinary approach with the study of archaeology , but he also emphasized the study of functionality and investigating what was the ancient relics ' original processes of manufacture . Shen used ancient texts and existing models of armillary spheres to create one based on ancient standards ; Shen described ancient weaponry such as the use of a scaled sighting device on crossbows ; while experimenting with ancient musical measures , Shen suggested hanging an ancient bell by using a hollow handle .",

  "The species can hunt singly , in pairs , and in groups , relying on sharp eyesight to locate prey . In some cases , supposed cooperative hunting may be incidental , a result of group members fishing individually in close proximity ; truly coordinated hunting may only occur where the prey cannot be taken by a single giant otter , such as with small anacondas and juvenile black caiman . The giant otter seems to prefer prey fish that are generally immobile on river bottoms in clear water . Prey chase is rapid and tumultuous , with lunges and twists through the shallows and few missed targets . The otter can attack from both above and below , swiveling at the last instant to clamp the prey in its jaws . Giant otters catch their own food and consume it immediately ; they grasp the fish firmly between the forepaws and begin eating noisily at the head .

  "As in the first Prayer Book , the origins and participants in the work of its revision are obscure , but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development . It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter . Late in 1550 , the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision . The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine . New rubrics noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the curate , thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence . The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead , as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory . The Act of Uniformity 1552 , which authorised the book 's use , specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November . However , the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute , due to Dudley 's intervention . While travelling in the north of the country , he met the Scots reformer , John Knox , then based in Newcastle . Impressed by his preaching , Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects . In a sermon before the king , Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion . On 27 September 1552 , the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it . He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy . On 22 October , the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so @-@ called Black Rubric , which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion .",

  "Actinium was discovered in 1899 by André @-@ Louis Debierne , an assistant of Marie Curie , in the pitchblende waste left after removal of radium and polonium . He described the substance ( in 1899 ) as similar to titanium and ( in 1900 ) as similar to thorium . The discovery of actinium by Debierne was however questioned in 1971 and 2000 , arguing that Debierne 's publications in 1904 contradicted his earlier work of 1899 – 1900 . The name actinium comes from the Greek aktis , aktinos ( ακτίς , ακτίνος ) , meaning beam or ray . This metal was discovered not by its own radiation but by the radiation of the daughter products .

Bonaventura said , \" She is so prepared and so ready and gung @-@ ho , she 'll do any stunt .

Salt 's fighting style was described as a mixture of Muay Thai , Shaolin Kung @-@ Fu , & Jeet Kune Do , which was considered by the stunt team the most fit for Jolie 's physique , and Krav Maga , for its rawness and aggressiveness . Noyce wanted to film the scene where Salt hangs from the edge of the building in a studio with chroma key , but Jolie insisted on doing it herself in the actual location . On May 29 , 2009 , filming was temporarily halted after Jolie suffered a minor head injury during filming an action scene . She was taken to a hospital as a precautionary measure and released on the same day with no serious injuries , allowing filming to resume . Salt 's escape after being captured in St. Bartholomew 's originally involved jumping her off a building into a window cleaning machine , but budgetary constraints caused the scene to be changed into a car chase .",
  "On 2 March 1955 Sihanouk abdicated the throne , and was in turn succeeded by his father , Suramarit . In his abdication speech , Sihanouk explained that he was abdicating in order to extricate himself from the \" intrigues \" of palace life and allow easier access to common folk as an \" ordinary citizen \" . According to Osborne , Sihanouk 's abdication earned him the freedom to pursue politics while continuing to enjoy the deference that he had received from his subjects when he was king . In April 1955 Sihanouk formed his own political party , the Sangkum , and expressed interest in competing in the general elections slated to be held in September 1955 . While the Sangkum was , in effect , a political party , Sihanouk argued that the Sangkum should be seen as a political \" organisation \" , and explained that he could accommodate people with differing political orientations on the sole condition that they pledged fealty to the monarchy .",

The book was named one of the best science and technology books of 2004 by Library Journal . In reviewing the book , Daniel I.

  "Fish @-@ eating killer whales prey on around 30 species of fish .

Salmon account for 96 % of northeast Pacific residents ' diet . About 65 % of them are large , fatty Chinook .

On average , a killer whale eats 227 kilograms ( 500 lb ) each day . While salmon are usually hunted by an individual or a small group of individuals , herring are often caught using carousel feeding ; the killer whales force the herring into a tight ball by releasing bursts of bubbles or flashing their white undersides .

  "The primary authority on the design of the film was concept artist Albert Hurter . All designs used in the film , from characters ' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background , had to meet Hurter 's approval before being finalized . Two other concept artists — Ferdinand Hovarth and Gustaf Tenggren — also contributed to the visual style of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . Hovarth developed a number of dark concepts for the film , although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter 's . Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film , as his style borrowed from the likes of Arthur Rackham and John Bauer and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought . He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book . However , Hovarth didn 't receive a credit for the film . Other artists to work on the film included Joe Grant , whose most significant contribution was the design for the Queen 's Witch form .",

  "Tractatus de globis begins with a letter by Hues dedicated to Raleigh that recalled geographical discoveries made by Englishmen during Elizabeth I 's reign . However , he felt that his countrymen would have surpassed the Spaniards and Portuguese if they had a complete knowledge of astronomy and geometry , which were essential to successful navigation . In the preface of the book , Hues rehearsed arguments that proved the earth is a sphere , and refuted opposing theories . The treatise was divided into five parts . The first part described elements common to Molyneux 's terrestrial and celestial globes , including the circles and lines inscribed on them , zones and climates , and the use of each globe 's wooden horizon circle and brass meridian . The second part described planets , fixed stars and constellations ; while the third part described the lands and seas shown on the terrestrial globe , and discussed the length of the circumference of the earth and of a degree of a great circle . Part 4 , which Hues considered the most important part of the work , explained how the globes enabled seamen to determine the sun 's position , latitude , course and distance , amplitudes and azimuths , and time and declination . The final part of the work contained a treatise inspired by Harriot on rhumb lines . In the work , Hues also published for the first time the six fundamental navigational propositions involved in solving what was later termed the \" nautical triangle \" used for plane sailing . Difference of latitude and departure ( or longitude ) are two sides of the triangle forming a right angle , the distance travelled is the hypotenuse , and the angle between difference of latitude and distance is the course . If any two elements are known , the other two can be determined by plotting or calculation using tables of sines , tangents and secants .",
  "Not content with his part , Despenser used his relationship with the king to impinge on the lands of other Marcher lords . This caused resentment among such men as Hereford and Roger Mortimer , who rose up in rebellion in 1321 . The rebellion was crushed , but resistance continued under the Marcher lords ' ally Thomas of Lancaster , who was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in 1322 , and executed . Although this victory temporarily secured Edward 's position on the throne , he was eventually deposed in 1326 by Roger Mortimer , with the help of the king 's wife Queen Isabella . The title of Earl of Gloucester was recreated by Edward II 's son Edward III in 1337 , for Hugh de Audley .",
  "Monitor was an unusual vessel in almost every respect and was sometimes sarcastically described by the press and other critics as \" Ericsson 's folly \" , \" cheesebox on a raft \" and the \" Yankee cheesebox \" . The most prominent feature on the vessel was a large cylindrical gun turret mounted amidships above the low @-@ freeboard upper hull , also called the \" raft \" . This extended well past the sides of the lower , more traditionally shaped hull . A small armored pilot house was fitted on the upper deck towards the bow , however , its position prevented Monitor from firing her guns straight forward . One of Ericsson 's prime goals in designing the ship was to present the smallest possible target to enemy gunfire . The ship was 179 feet ( 54 @.@ 6 m ) long overall , had a beam of 41 feet 6 inches ( 12 @.@ 6 m ) and had a maximum draft of 10 feet 6 inches ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) .

  "While the Giro had in its peloton many notable riders , including six former Grand Tour winners , the odds @-@ on favorite was always Saxo Bank – SunGard 's Alberto Contador . The 2008 Giro champion , who had likewise won the 2008 Vuelta a España and three editions of the Tour de France , announced in April 2010 that he would contest the Giro in 2011 . Though his status was put in doubt after a positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France , he was cleared by his national federation in February 2011 and able to return to racing , though the case still pended a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport later in 2011 . Contador was the overwhelming favorite for overall victory . Reigning Giro champion Ivan Basso chose not to return , preferring to focus on the Tour de France later in the season . He briefly considered riding as a domestique for Vincenzo Nibali , but opted against it because of his physical condition at the time and the feeling that doing so would be disrespectful to the race . The 2011 Giro was thus the third successive edition , and fourth in the last five , in which the reigning champion did not return to defend his championship .",

At the beginning of the Byzantine millennium , the koine ( Greek : κοινή ) remained the basis for spoken Greek and Christian writings , while Attic Greek was the language of the philosophers and orators .",

  "It was in this cultic milieu that Narendra became acquainted with western esotericism .

  "In the opening lines of the poem Dryden describes King Cinyras just as Ovid did as a man who had been happier if he had not become a father . Lee suggests that this is a direct parallel to James who could have been counted as happier if he had not had his daughter , Mary , who betrayed him and usurped his monarchical position . When describing the act of incest Dryden uses a monster metaphor . Those lines are suggested as aimed at William III who invaded England from the Netherlands and whose presence Dryden describes as a curse or a punishment , according to Lee . A little further on the Convention Parliament is indicted . Lee suggests that Dryden critiques the intrusiveness of the Convention Parliament , because it acted without constituted legal authority . Finally the daughter , Mary as Myrrha , is described as an impious outcast from civilization , whose greatest sin was her disrupting the natural line of succession thereby breaking both natural as well as divine statutes which resulted in fundamental social confusion . When Myrrha craves and achieves her father 's ( Cinyras ' ) bed , Lee sees a parallel to Mary 's ascending James ' throne : both daughters incestuously occupied the place which belonged to their fathers .",

  "They found albatross chicks and seals to eat , but despite the relative comfort of the island compared to the small boat , they still urgently needed to reach the whaling station at Husvik on the other side of the island to fetch help for the men on Elephant Island . It was clear that McNish and Vincent could not continue , so Shackleton left them in the care of Timothy McCarthy camped in the upturned James Caird , and with Worsley and Crean made the hazardous trip over the mountains . McNish took screws from the James Caird and attached them to the boots of the men making the journey to help them grip the ice . He also fashioned a crude sledge from driftwood he found on the beach , but it proved too clumsy to be practical . When Shackleton 's party set off on 18 May 1916 , McNish accompanied them for a few hundred yards but he was unable to go any further . He shook hands with each of the men , wished them good luck and then Shackleton sent him back . Putting McNish in command of the remaining men , Shackleton charged him to wait for relief and if none had come by the end of winter to attempt to sail to the east coast . Once Shackleton 's party had crossed the mountains and arrived in Husvik , he sent Worsley with one of the whaler 's ships , Samson , to pick up McNish and the other men .

  "However , there is some debate among Bible translators about the correct reading of Luke 2 : 2 . Instead of translating the registration as taking place \" when \" Quirinius was governor of Syria , some versions translate it as \" before \" or use \" before \" as an alternative , which Harold Hoehner , F.F. Bruce , Ben Witherington and others have suggested may be the correct translation . While not in agreement , Emil Schürer also acknowledged that such a translation can be justified grammatically . According to Josephus , the tax census conducted by the Roman senator Quirinius particularly irritated the Jews , and was one of the causes of the Zealot movement of armed resistance to Rome . From this perspective , Luke may have been trying to differentiate the census at the time of Jesus ’ birth from the tax census mentioned in Acts 5 : 37 that took place under Quirinius at a later time . One ancient writer identified the census at Jesus ’ birth , not with taxes , but with a universal pledge of allegiance to the emperor .",

  "The fruit bodies of Phellodon species have caps and stipe , and thus fall into the general category \" stipitate hydnoid fungi \" . The cap surfaces are initially velvety to tomentose , eventually becoming matted . The surface is rough , with pits and ridges , and sometimes with concentrical zones of color or texture . The color can vary considerably , from cream to yellowish , brownish , greenish , greyish or black . Neighboring fruitbodies can fuse together , forming intertwined caps and partially fused stipes . Alexander H. Smith wrote of P. tomentosus , \" It often occurs in large mats of fused caps almost producing a ceiling over large areas of the moss under conifers . \" Phellodon fruitbodies can envelop nearby grass or twigs . The stipe is thickly tomentose or smooth , typically the same color as the cap or darker . In P. niger , the outer covering of the stipe is a thick felty layer of mycelium that absorbs water like a sponge . The hymenophore ( the fertile , spore @-@ bearing surface ) is on the underside of the cap . The spines become grey at maturity . In conditions of high humidity , P. niger can form striking drops of black liquid on the actively growing caps .",

  "Because of the way Concorde 's delta @-@ wing generated lift , the undercarriage had to be unusually strong . At rotation , Concorde would rise to a high angle of attack , about 18 degrees . Prior to rotation the wing generated almost no lift , unlike typical aircraft wings . Combined with the high airspeed at rotation ( 199 knots indicated airspeed ) , this increased the stresses on the main undercarriage in a way that was initially unexpected during the development and required a major redesign . Due to the high angle needed at rotation , a small set of wheels were added aft to prevent tailstrikes .

  "Starting in the latter half of the 19th century , the lower Colorado below Black Canyon became an important waterway for steamboat commerce . In 1852 , the Uncle Sam was launched to provide supplies to the U.S. Army outpost at Fort Yuma . Although this vessel accidentally foundered and sank early in its career , commercial traffic quickly proliferated because river transport was much cheaper than hauling freight over land . Navigation on the Colorado River was dangerous because of the shallow channel and flow variations , so the first sternwheeler on the river , the Colorado of 1855 , was designed to carry 60 short tons ( 54 t ) while drawing less than 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) of water .

  "The origins of glam rock are associated with Marc Bolan , who had renamed his folk duo to T. Rex and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s . Often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the UK TV programme Top of the Pops in December 1970 wearing glitter , to perform what would be his first number 1 single \" Ride a White Swan \" . From 1971 , already a minor star , David Bowie developed his Ziggy Stardust persona , incorporating elements of professional make up , mime and performance into his act . These performers were soon followed in the style by acts including Roxy Music , Sweet , Slade , Mott the Hoople , Mud and Alvin Stardust . While highly successful in the single charts in the UK , very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the United States ; Bowie was the major exception becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like Lou Reed , Iggy Pop , New York Dolls and Jobriath , often known as \" glitter rock \" and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts . In the UK the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by Gary Glitter and his support musicians the Glitter Band , who between them achieved eighteen top ten singles in the UK between 1972 and 1976 . A second wave of glam rock acts , including Suzi Quatro , Roy Wood 's Wizzard and Sparks , dominated the British single charts from about 1974 to 1976 . Existing acts , some not usually considered central to the genre , also adopted glam styles , including Rod Stewart , Elton John , Queen and , for a time , even the Rolling Stones . It was also a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later , including Kiss and Adam Ant , and less directly on the formation of gothic rock and glam metal as well as on punk rock , which helped end the fashion for glam from about 1976 . Glam has since enjoyed sporadic modest revivals through bands such as Chainsaw Kittens , the Darkness and in R n ' B crossover act Prince .",

Since then , some have claimed that the Hall of Fame has become too exclusive . The Hall of Fame has also been criticised for failing to induct international players and critics have claimed that the Hall has been far too focused on the National Hockey League . A common statement is that it is more of an \" NHL Hall of Fame \" than a general Hockey Hall of Fame .

  "The last stage of rocky planet formation is the merger stage . It begins when only a small number of planetesimals remains and embryos become massive enough to perturb each other , which causes their orbits to become chaotic . During this stage embryos expel remaining planetesimals , and collide with each other . The result of this process , which lasts for 10 to 100 million years , is the formation of a limited number of Earth sized bodies . Simulations show that the number of surviving planets is on average from 2 to 5 . In the Solar System they may be represented by Earth and Venus . Formation of both planets required merging of approximately 10 – 20 embryos , while an equal number of them were thrown out of the Solar System . Some of the embryos , which originated in the asteroid belt , are thought to have brought water to Earth . Mars and Mercury may be regarded as remaining embryos that survived that rivalry . Rocky planets , which have managed to coalesce , settle eventually into more or less stable orbits , explaining why planetary systems are generally packed to the limit ; or , in other words , why they always appear to be at the brink of instability .",

For the next three days , it remained nearly stationary without development , until the system became better defined on May 22 when it began moving to the northeast . On May 23 , the elongated low had an area of disorganized convection . While passing over the Cuban Island of Isla de la Juventud , an exposed center of circulation and transient convection was noted due to the effects of high wind shear across the region .

  "Host @-@ parasite mimicry is a two species system where a parasite mimics its own host . Cuckoos are a canonical example of brood parasitism , a form of kleptoparasitism where the mother has its offspring raised by another unwitting organism , cutting down the biological mother 's parental investment in the process . The ability to lay eggs that mimic the host eggs is the key adaptation . The adaptation to different hosts is inherited through the female line in so @-@ called gentes . Cases of intraspecific brood parasitism , where a female lays in conspecific 's nest , as illustrated by the goldeneye duck ( Bucephala clangula ) , do not represent a case of mimicry . Another example is that of chemical mimicry , in which the parasitic butterfly Phengaris rebeli , which parasitizes the ant species Myrmica schencki by releasing chemicals that fool the worker ants to believe that the caterpillar larvae are ant larvae , and enable the P. rebeli larvae to be brought directly into the M. schencki nest . Parasitic ( cuckoo ) bumblebees ( formerly Psithyrus , now included in Bombus ) resemble their hosts more closely than would be expected by chance , at least in areas like Europe where parasite @-@ host co @-@ speciation is common .

  "Rolling Stone writer Teri Moris applauded the album 's ' rockier ' moments but discerned a move away from the genre , finding it \" the thoughtfully professional effort of a style @-@ conscious artist whose ability to write and perform demanding rock & roll exists comfortably alongside his fascination for diverse forms ... while there 's little doubt about his skill , one wonders how long he 'll continue wrestling with rock at all \" . Circus , noting that Bowie was \" never one to maintain continuity in his work or in his life \" , declared that Station to Station \" offers cryptic , expressionistic glimpses that let us feel the contours and palpitations of the masquer 's soul but never fully reveal his face . \" The review also found various allusions to earlier Bowie efforts , such as the \" density \" of The Man Who Sold the World , the \" pop feel \" of Hunky Dory , the \" dissonance and angst \" of Aladdin Sane , the \" compelling percussion \" of Young Americans , and the \" youthful mysticism \" of \" Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud \" , concluding that \" it shows Bowie pulling out on the most challenging leg of his winding journey \" .",
  "A white dwarf is very hot when it forms , but because it has no source of energy , it will gradually radiate its energy and cool . This means that its radiation , which initially has a high color temperature , will lessen and redden with time . Over a very long time , a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize ( starting with the core ) . The star 's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light , and it will become a cold black dwarf . The length of time it takes for a white dwarf to reach this state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe ( approximately 13 @.@ 8 billion years ) , and it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist . The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvin .",

  "Seeing stellite as a far more valuable metal , he decided to keep its patent for himself and founded the Haynes Stellite Company in Kokomo to produce the metal in September 1912 . Many of his initial requests for the metal were from medical tool manufacturers who saw the alloy as the best for surgical tools . Because his company could not produce enough of the metal to satisfy demand , Haynes issued licenses to several companies in the United States , Canada , and Europe to produce the alloy and pay him royalties . Haynes strictly controlled production , and did not permit the other licensees to sell stellite in its raw form , but to only sell it as specific finished products . In that way , he remained the only vendor who could sell sheets of the metal . As World War I broke out , his company received large government contracts for use of the material . Stellite was found to have excellent applications in airplanes , and because it was non @-@ corrosive and could protect its contents indefinitely , it proved to be the best metal available for ammunition casing . In 1916 alone , the company registered $ 1 @.@ 3 million in sales . The rapid growth of the business made Haynes increasingly wealthy and he became a millionaire that year . Despite his large income , he refused to provide his employees a year @-@ end bonus , causing a significant stir in the factory .

  "As the clitoris 's external location does not allow for direct stimulation by sexual penetration , any external clitoral stimulation while in the missionary position usually results from the pubic bone area , the movement of the groins when in contact .

  "When Andros came to New York , he moved to stabilize the situation . He befriended the Lenape sachems ( chiefs ) , convincing them to act as mediators between the English and other tribes . Peace appeared to be imminent when Bacon 's Rebellion broke out in Maryland , resulting in an attack on the Susquehannock fort on the Potomac . The surviving Susquehannocks sneaked out of the fort one night , some of them making their way east toward Delaware Bay . In June 1676 Andros offered , in exchange for their moving into his jurisdiction , to protect them from their enemies among the Virginian and Maryland settlers . He also extended an offer given by the Mohawk for the Susquehannocks to settle among them . These offers were well received , but Maryland authorities were unable to convince their Indian allies to make the peace offered by Andros , and organized them to march toward the Delaware , which would also fulfil the goal of strengthening the Maryland claim to the area . Andros responded by urging the Susquehannocks to retreat into New York , where they would be beyond Maryland 's reach , and delivering a strongly worded threat to Maryland , that it would either have to acknowledge his sovereignty over the Susquehannocks , or they would have to peacably take them back . He also offered his services as a mediator , pointing out that the absence of the Susquehannocks now left Maryland settlements open to direct attack by the Iroquois .",

  "In all known organisms , the Deoxyribonucleotides that make up DNA are synthesized by the action of ribonucleotide reductase ( RNR ) enzymes on their corresponding ribonucleotides . These enzymes reduce the sugar residue from ribose to deoxyribose by removing oxygen from the 2 ′ hydroxyl group ; the substrates are ribonucleoside diphosphates and the products deoxyribonucleoside diphosphates ( the latter are denoted dADP , dCDP , dGDP , and dUDP respectively . ) All ribonucleotide reductase enzymes use a common sulfhydryl radical mechanism reliant on reactive cysteine residues that oxidize to form disulfide bonds in the course of the reaction .

After the arrest Stephen forced the bishops to surrender their castles and secular government offices . Most historians see Foliot 's letter as firmly supporting Matilda 's cause , although one of King Stephen 's recent biographers , Donald Matthew , claims that Foliot 's support was lukewarm at best , motivated by the location of his abbey in one of Matilda 's strongholds .

  "After the English Reformation of the 16th century , an increasing number of people were unhappy with the control that the government and monarch had over the Church of England . This led to the formation of independent churches and schools by what are known as Dissenters . The worship of any faith other than Anglicanism was illegal , and those discovered taking part were arrested and even sentenced to death . Oliver Cromwell imposed a period of religious tolerance , but his death precipitated further persecution of Dissenters , principally through the Act of Uniformity 1549 , which required the use of the Book of Common Prayer as the only legal form of worship in England . The South West of England in general , and Taunton specifically , had a significant Dissenter population . There was a Baptist community in the town by 1646 , and despite continued persecution they erected their first Meeting House in Taunton , on Mary Street in 1670 .",

  "Governor William A. Stone appointed a new Capitol Building Commission in 1901 . The commission then held another design competition , for Pennsylvania architects only , which prevented Cobb , a Chicagoan , from submitting a design or finishing his capitol . The Building Commission also stipulated that parts of the unfinished , current capitol were to be used in the new capitol . The General Assembly had appropriated $ 4 million for the construction of the capitol . It did not limit the total amount to be used in furnishing the building . This caused problems after construction completion of the capitol . The American Institute of Architects was opposed to competition , citing that the terms of the competition were \" calculated to only ' encourage favoritism and injustice ' and that they in no way obligated the Capitol [ Building ] Commission to select the best design or the best architect \" . The Institute also advised that no Pennsylvania architects enter the competition ; Philadelphia architect Addison Hutton was subsequently expelled from the organization after submitting an entry . Joseph Miller Huston 's design was chosen from among nine entries in the competition in January 1902 .",

The DUKWs and most boats landed too far downstream and at least 200 men were captured .",
  "Since protein structure was so poorly understood in the 1930s , the physical interactions responsible for stabilizing that structure were likewise unknown .

The idea that globular proteins are also stabilized by hydrogen bonds was proposed by Dorothy Jordan Lloyd in 1932 , and championed later by Alfred Mirsky and Linus Pauling . At a 1933 lecture by Astbury to the Oxford Junior Scientific Society , physicist Frederick Frank suggested that the fibrous protein α @-@ keratin might be stabilized by an alternative mechanism , namely , covalent crosslinking of the peptide bonds by the cyclol reaction above .

  "In 1546 , the conservatives in a coalition including Gardiner , the Duke of Norfolk , the Lord Chancellor Wriothesley , and the bishop of London , Edmund Bonner , made one last attempt to challenge the reformers . Several reformers with links to Cranmer were targeted . Some such as Lascelles were burnt at the stake . However , powerful reform @-@ minded nobles Edward Seymour and John Dudley returned to England during the summer from overseas and they were able to turn the tide against the conservatives . Two incidents in autumn tipped the balance . Gardiner was disgraced before the king when he refused to agree to exchange episcopal estates and the son of the Duke of Norfolk was charged with treason and executed . There is no evidence that Cranmer played any part in these political games and there were no further plots as the king 's health ebbed in his final months . Cranmer performed his final duties for the king on 28 January 1547 when he gave a reformed statement of faith while gripping Henry ’ s hand instead of giving him his last rites . Cranmer mourned Henry ’ s death and it was later said that he demonstrated his grief by growing a beard . The beard was also a sign of his break with the past .

  "Debussy was known for his meticulousness in the arrangement of his preludes . Pianist and musical writer Paul Roberts asserts that this prelude , along with the two that immediately precede it , forms \" the central arch \" of Book I 's structure , since the three pieces provide the most \" dramatic contrast \" out of all the preludes in the first book . The sixth prelude , Des pas sur la neige ( Footprints in the Snow ) , evokes a feeling of sadness and isolation , while Ce qu 'a vu le vent d 'ouest ( What the West wind saw ) — the seventh — exudes a violent and tumultuous nature . In stark contrast to these two , La fille brings about a sense of gentle \" lyricism \" and \" warmth \" , which is uncharacteristic of Debussy 's music of this kind .

  "Bacteria have developed ways to survive inside phagocytes , where they continue to evade the immune system . To get safely inside the phagocyte they express proteins called \" invasins \" . When inside the cell they remain in the cytoplasm and avoid toxic chemicals contained in the phagolysosomes . Some bacteria prevent the fusion of a phagosome and lysosome , to form the phagolysosome . Other pathogens , such as Leishmania , create a highly modified vacuole inside the phagocyte , which helps them persist and replicate . Some bacteria are capable of living inside of the phagolysosome . Staphylococcus aureus , for example , produces the enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase , which break down chemicals — such as hydrogen peroxide — produced by phagocytes to kill bacteria .

When Koht in 1938 attempted to establish a trade agreement with Franco , he was blocked by his own party and the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions . Again requesting to be allowed to resign , Koht stayed after months of debating ended with the party giving the cabinet free rein to do what it saw as best with regards to trade with Franco . By October 1938 Koht had negotiated a trade agreement with Franco . The formal Norwegian recognition of the Franco government as the representative of Spain followed on 31 March 1939 , three days after the fall of Madrid to the nationalist forces .",

The winning player may choose a card from their opponent 's deck out of the ones they put under their control . If the winning player scores a perfect win however , in which all ten cards are put under their control , they will win all five cards from the opponent 's deck .",

  "The origins of Hurricane Tico were from a weak tropical disturbance that crossed Costa Rica into the Pacific Ocean on October 7 . Over warm waters , the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty @-@ One on October 11 , about 575 mi ( 930 km ) south of Acapulco . On October 12 it turned sharply northward ; the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October 13 . Tropical Storm Tico continued to intensify . Two days after becoming a tropical storm , Tico strengthened further to attain hurricane status . By October 16 , Tico had reached major hurricane status . Early on October 19 , it reached peak winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) . It weakened slightly as it approached the coast , and at about 1500 UTC that day Tico made landfall near Mazatlán with winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) . It rapidly weakened over land and merged with a cold front . The remnants of Tico were last observed on October 24 over Ohio .",
  "The earthquake was caused by a rupture along the Abiz Fault , part of the Sistan suture zone of eastern Iran . Located northeast of the main collision zone between the Arabian and Eurasian tectonic plates , the Sistan zone marks the eastern boundary of the Iranian microplate where it intersects with the Afghan crustal block . Most of Iran is contained on one microplate , causing seismic activity mainly along its borders . Both the 1968 Dasht @-@ e @-@ Bayez earthquake ( magnitude 7 @.@ 3 , resulting in 12 @,@ 000 – 20 @,@ 000 deaths ) and the Qayen earthquake were the results of strike @-@ slip faults , meaning that the crustal blocks on either side of the faults shifted against each other horizontally . The Qayen earthquake was caused by right lateral movement along the Abiz Fault . In addition to the dominant strike @-@ slip displacement , there was also local evidence of reverse faulting . The average displacement of about 2 m indicates a low static stress drop , more consistent with an interplate earthquake than an intraplate event . The maximum horizontal acceleration during the quake was approximately 6 @.@ 9 meters per second — nearly three @-@ quarters of the acceleration an object would have in free fall — and occurred near the earthquake 's epicenter . The crustal layer involved in the rupture was 20 – 25 kilometers ( 12 – 16 mi ) thick . The surface fault that caused the earthquake extended for 110 kilometers ( 68 mi ) , which was longer than would be expected given the earthquake 's magnitude . There were at least 155 aftershocks , reaching a magnitude of up to 5 @.@ 5 on the Richter magnitude scale . Many of the aftershocks occurred along the rupture up to 24 kilometers ( 15 mi ) below the surface .",

Proceeding to deal with the Late- and Post @-@ Medieval deposition of pots under foundations , he looks at their place in churches , where it was believed that they aided the acoustics .

  "Lindwall bowled a series of short balls . One hit Compton on the arm and the batsman attempted to hook another bouncer , but edged it into his face . Upon hearing the umpire 's call of no ball while the ball was travelling towards him , and knowing he was immune from dismissal , Compton decided to change his stroke . Having initially positioned himself to deflect the ball into the leg side , he then attempted to hook the ball , but could not readjust quickly enough . The velocity of the ball was such that it rebounded from his head and flew more than halfway to the boundary before landing . This forced Compton to leave the field with a bloodied eyebrow with the score at 33 / 2 . After a ten @-@ minute delay , Crapp strode to the centre for his debut innings , and he got off the mark from his first ball , gliding Lindwall past gully for a single . Lindwall then struck Edrich on the hand with another short ball , provoking angry heckling from spectators who compared him to Harold Larwood , a 1930s paceman who targeted batsmen with Bodyline , a strategy of intimidatory bowling . Edrich and Crapp then engaged in grim defensive play , resulting in one 25 @-@ minute period during which only one run was added , as England reached lunch with their total on 57 / 2 . Edrich had made 14 from 90 minutes of batting , while Crapp had made 11 in 60 minutes . One of the motives of batting slowly without taking risks was to ensure the innings lasted long enough that it would still be in progress by the time Compton recovered from his concussion , so he could resume batting . Edrich appeared to be lacking in confidence due to his recent run of low scores , and thus hesitant to play with any attacking intent , whereas Crapp was usually circumspect . For a series of accurate overs from Ernie Toshack , Crapp repeatedly defended a sequence of deliveries to Arthur Morris at silly point . Toshack 's first five overs were all maidens .",

  "While single passenger cars were sometimes moved around the system , either between depots or to Acton Works , these movements were infrequent , and when they were necessary , standard stock motor cars borrowed from the passenger fleet were normally used . Following the introduction of the 1959 passenger stock , single cars and parts of units were moved around much more frequently , and normal passenger motor cars could not be used to perform this task , as the equipment they needed to operate was spread around the unit , rather than confined to the motor car . Eight Standard Stock motor cars , dating from 1927 and 1934 , were therefore allocated as pilot motor cars .

  "In 2007 , John Foster suggested that the differences usually cited to differentiate Amphicoelias altus from the more well known Diplodocus are not significant and may be due to individual variation . Foster argued that Amphicoelias is probably the senior synonym of Diplodocus , and that if further research bears this out , the familiar name Diplodocus would need to be abandoned in favor of Amphicoelias , as was the case with Brontosaurus and its senior synonym Apatosaurus . In 2015 , Woodruff and Foster reiterated this conclusion , stating that there is only one species of Amphicoelias and that it could be referred to Diplodocus as Diplodocus altus . They considered the name Amphicoelias to be a nomen oblitum . It has also been hypothesized that Amphicoelias should be considered an apatosaurine , and therefore should be placed in the subfamily Apatosaurinae .",

Alligators and caimans split in North America during the late Cretaceous and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene , before the closure of the Isthmus of Panama during the Neogene period . The Chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed the Bering land bridge during the Neogene .

  "Charles Jennens was born around 1700 , into a prosperous landowning family whose lands and properties in Warwickshire and Leicestershire he eventually inherited . His religious and political views — he opposed the Act of Settlement of 1701 which secured the accession to the British throne for the House of Hanover — prevented him from receiving his degree from Balliol College , Oxford , or from pursuing any form of public career . His family 's wealth enabled him to live a life of leisure while devoting himself to his literary and musical interests . Although the musicologist Watkins Shaw dismisses Jennens as \" a conceited figure of no special ability \" , Donald Burrows has written : \" of Jennens 's musical literacy there can be no doubt \" . He was certainly devoted to Handel 's music , having helped to finance the publication of every Handel score since Rodelinda in 1725 . By 1741 , after their collaboration on Saul , a warm friendship had developed between the two , and Handel was a frequent visitor to the Jennens family estate at Gopsall .",

  "Similarly , the anonymous scholiast provides a probable date for the Siege of Eion . This annotation places the fall of Eion in the archonship of Phaidon ( known to be 476 / 475 BC ) . The Siege may therefore have been between either 477 – 476 BC or 476 – 475 BC ; both have found favour . The Battle of Eurymedon may be dated to 469 BC by Plutarch 's anecdote about the Archon Apsephion ( 469 / 468 BC ) choosing Cimon and his fellow generals as judges in a competition . The implication is that Cimon had recently achieved a great victory , and the most likely candidate is Eurymedon . However , since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred after the Athenian siege of Naxos ( but before the Siege of Thasos ) , the date of Eurymedon is clearly constrained by the date of Naxos . Whilst some accept a date of 469 or earlier for this Naxos , another school of thought places it as late as 467 BC . Since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred before Thasos , the alternative date for this battle would therefore be 466 BC .",

  "The club crest depicts an ox above a representation of a ford to symbolise the location .

While the presbyterian divines were capable of defending their vision for church government as established by divine right in the Bible , they were unwilling to answer the queries because doing so would further expose the disunity of the Assembly and weaken their case in Parliament .

  "Anne 's biographer Eric Ives believes that her fall and execution were primarily engineered by her former ally Thomas Cromwell . The conversations between Chapuys and Cromwell thereafter indicate Cromwell as the instigator of the plot to remove Anne ; evidence of this is seen in the Spanish Chronicle and through letters written from Chapuys to Charles V. Anne argued with Cromwell over the redistribution of Church revenues and over foreign policy . She advocated that revenues be distributed to charitable and educational institutions ; and she favoured a French alliance . Cromwell insisted on filling the King 's depleted coffers , while taking a cut for himself , and preferred an imperial alliance . For these reasons , Ives suggests , \" Anne Boleyn had become a major threat to Thomas Cromwell . \" Cromwell 's biographer John Schofield , on the other hand , contends that no power struggle existed between Anne and Cromwell and that \" not a trace can be found of a Cromwellian conspiracy against Anne ... Cromwell became involved in the royal marital drama only when Henry ordered him onto the case . \" Cromwell did not manufacture the accusations of adultery , though he and other officials used them to bolster Henry 's case against Anne . Historian Retha Warnicke questions whether Cromwell could have or wished to manipulate the king in such a matter . Such a bold attempt by Cromwell , given the limited evidence , could have risked his office , even his life . Henry himself issued the crucial instructions : his officials , including Cromwell , carried them out . The result , historians agree , was a legal travesty . However modern lawyers have concluded that the rules of the time were not bent in order to assure Anne Boleyn 's conviction ; there was no need to tamper with rules that guaranteed the desired result since law at the time , like armies , was an engine of state , not a mechanism for justice .",

He felt the game turned out well because the project 's leader was a \" huge Mega Man fan \" who appeared to understand the games better than some of Capcom 's own people .
