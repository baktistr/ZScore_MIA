  "Going against the normal convention that the strongest characters should be the largest in terms of physical size , he designed many of Dragon Ball 's most powerful characters with small statures , including the protagonist , Goku . When creating a character , his process is to first come up with their face and body type , and then the clothes while thinking of the world they inhabit and if the fighters can move around in them . Toriyama said that he did not plan the details of the story , resulting in strange occurrences and discrepancies later in the series , including changing the colors of the characters mid @-@ story and few characters having screen tone because he found it difficult to use .",
  "In 1936 , her husband unexpectedly became King when his brother , Edward VIII , abdicated in order to marry the American divorcée Wallis Simpson . Elizabeth became Queen . She accompanied her husband on diplomatic tours to France and North America before the start of World War II . During the war , her seemingly indomitable spirit provided moral support to the British public .

After the war , her husband 's health deteriorated and she was widowed at the age of 51 . Her elder daughter , aged 25 , became the new Queen .",
  "In a DNA double helix , each type of nucleobase on one strand bonds with just one type of nucleobase on the other strand . This is called complementary base pairing . Here , purines form hydrogen bonds to pyrimidines , with adenine bonding only to thymine in two hydrogen bonds , and cytosine bonding only to guanine in three hydrogen bonds . This arrangement of two nucleotides binding together across the double helix is called a base pair . As hydrogen bonds are not covalent , they can be broken and rejoined relatively easily . The two strands of DNA in a double helix can therefore be pulled apart like a zipper , either by a mechanical force or high temperature . As a result of this complementarity , all the information in the double @-@ stranded sequence of a DNA helix is duplicated on each strand , which is vital in DNA replication . Indeed , this reversible and specific interaction between complementary base pairs is critical for all the functions of DNA in living organisms .",
  "The original executive producers of the U.S. Millionaire were British television producers Michael Davies and Paul Smith , the latter of whom undertook the responsibility of licensing Millionaire to American airwaves as part of his effort to transform the UK program into a global franchise .

  "As the election of 1880 drew near , Bayard was again regarded as a likely candidate . Hayes had pledged himself to a one @-@ term presidency , which meant the Republicans would not have the advantage of incumbency . On the Democratic side , Tilden was regarded as the natural choice , as many Democrats were still convinced he had been robbed of the office in 1876 . Tilden 's supporters saw Bayard as a rival , and sought to smear him by suggesting he had colluded with Republicans to defeat Tilden in 1876 . Meanwhile , in the House , Tilden supporter Clarkson Nott Potter of New York began an investigation into the 1876 election , hoping that evidence of Republican malfeasance would harm that party 's candidate in 1880 . In fact , the Potter committee 's investigation had the opposite effect , uncovering telegrams from Tilden 's nephew , William Tilden Pelton , that offered bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes . The telegrams doomed Tilden 's hopes for the nomination , and boosted Bayard 's chance among the erstwhile Tilden supporters .",

Thus the scholar @-@ bureaucrats came to the fore to keep track of the income and expenses of the granaries . Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration ; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within . These cities combined to become feudal states , which eventually united to become an empire . Likewise , according to this model , walls not only enveloped cities as time went by , but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes .",

  "As no complete dodo specimens exist , its external appearance , such as plumage and colouration , is hard to determine . Illustrations and written accounts of encounters with the dodo between its discovery and its extinction ( 1598 – 1662 ) are the primary evidence for its external appearance . According to most representations , the dodo had greyish or brownish plumage , with lighter primary feathers and a tuft of curly light feathers high on its rear end . The head was grey and naked , the beak green , black and yellow , and the legs were stout and yellowish , with black claws . A study of the few remaining feathers on the Oxford specimen head showed that they were pennaceous rather than plumaceous ( downy ) and most similar to those of other pigeons .",

  "To most philosophers , the word \" consciousness \" connotes the relationship between the mind and the world . To writers on spiritual or religious topics , it frequently connotes the relationship between the mind and God , or the relationship between the mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world . Krishna consciousness , for example , is a term used to mean an intimate linkage between the mind of a worshipper and the god Krishna . The mystical psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke distinguished between three types of consciousness : Simple Consciousness , awareness of the body , possessed by many animals ; Self Consciousness , awareness of being aware , possessed only by humans ; and Cosmic Consciousness , awareness of the life and order of the universe , possessed only by humans who are enlightened . Many more examples could be given . The most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be Ken Wilber 's book The Spectrum of Consciousness , a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind . Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end , and more profound types of awareness at higher levels .",

  "Both these types of reading have now fallen out of favour ; there is little consensus about the meaning of The Country Wife , but its \" notorious resistance to interpretation \" is having an invigorating rather than damping effect on academic interest . The play 's ideological dimension has been emphasised recently . It was written by a courtier for a courtly and aristocratic audience , and Douglas Canfield has pointed to an unusual complication for a courtly play .

The courtier code proposed by Wycherley is of a sexual game . Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick argued in Between Men that the game is played not between men and women , but between men by means of women , who are merely the \" conduits \" of homosocial desire between men . The hierarchy of wits meant that the wittiest and most virile man would win at the game . Thus Horner , as Canfield puts it , \" represents not just class superiority , but that subset of class represented by the Town wits , a privileged minority that ... is the jet set identified with the Town and the Court as the loci of real power in the kingdom . \" The aggressive attack mounted in the china scene against the class and the generation by which Wycherley was patronised with the expectation that he would defend it ( against Sir Jaspar Fidget and Lady Fidget ) , suggests Canfield , would only let an audience of that class laugh comfortably if Horner were punished by actual impotence in the end , which he is not . \" When the play concludes with no poetical justice that makes Horner really impotent \" , writes Canfield , \" leaving him instead potent and still on the make , the audience laughs at its own expense : the women of quality nervously because they have been misogynistically slandered ; the men of quality nervously because at some level they recognize that class solidarity is just a pleasing fiction . \"",

  "The Vienna @-@ born but largely American @-@ raised Josef von Sternberg was directing in Hollywood at the same time . Films of his such as Shanghai Express ( 1932 ) and The Devil Is a Woman ( 1935 ) , with their hothouse eroticism and baroque visual style , specifically anticipate central elements of classic noir . The commercial and critical success of Sternberg 's silent Underworld ( 1927 ) was largely responsible for spurring a trend of Hollywood gangster films . Successful films in that genre such as Little Caesar ( 1931 ) , The Public Enemy ( 1931 ) , and Scarface ( 1932 ) demonstrated that there was an audience for crime dramas with morally reprehensible protagonists . An important , and possibly influential , cinematic antecedent to classic noir was 1930s French poetic realism , with its romantic , fatalistic attitude and celebration of doomed heroes . The movement 's sensibility is mirrored in the Warner Bros. drama I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang ( 1932 ) , a key forerunner of noir . Among those films not themselves considered films noir , perhaps none had a greater effect on the development of the genre than Citizen Kane ( 1941 ) , directed by Orson Welles .

Clarke became one of the first female professional orchestral musicians when she was selected by Sir Henry Wood to play in the Queen 's Hall Orchestra in 1912 . In 1916 she moved to the United States to continue her performing career . A short , lyrical piece for viola and piano entitled Morpheus , composed under the pseudonym of \" Anthony Trent \" , was premiered at her 1918 joint recital with cellist May Muklé in New York City . Reviewers praised the \" Trent \" , largely ignoring the works credited to Clarke premiered in the same recital . Her compositional career peaked in a brief period , beginning with the viola sonata she entered in a 1919 competition sponsored by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge , Clarke 's neighbour and a patron of the arts . In a field of 72 entrants , Clarke 's sonata tied for first place with a composition by Ernest Bloch . Coolidge later declared Bloch the winner . Reporters speculated that \" Rebecca Clarke \" was only a pseudonym for Bloch himself , or at least that it could not have been Clarke who wrote these pieces , as the idea that a woman could write such a work was socially inconceivable . The sonata was well received and had its first performance at the Berkshire music festival in 1919 .

  "When a person turns and faces himself in order to understand himself , he steps , as it were , in the way of that first self , halts that which was turned outward in hankering for and seeking after the surrounding world that is its object , and summons it back from the external .

This is indeed the way it is ; the world around us is inconstant and can be changed into the opposite at any moment , and there is not one person who can force this change by his own might or by the conjuration of his wish . The deeper self now shapes the deceitful flexibility of the surrounding world in such a way that it is no longer attractive to the first self . Then the first self either must proceed to kill the deeper self , to render it forgotten , whereby the whole matter is given up ; or it must admit that the deeper self is right , because to want to predicate constancy of something that continually changes is indeed a contradiction , and as soon as one confesses that it changes , it can of course , change in that same moment . However much that first self shrinks from this , there is no wordsmith so ingenious or no thought @-@ twister so wily that he can invalidate the deeper self ’ s eternal claim . There is only one way out , and that is to silence the deeper self by letting the roar of inconstancy drown it out . Eighteen Upbuilding Discourses , 1845 , Hong translation , p . 314",

  "Gregory was born around 335 , probably in or near the city of Neocaesarea , Pontus . His family was aristocratic and Christian - according to Gregory of Nazianzus , his mother was Emmelia of Caesarea , and his father , a rhetorician , has been identified either as Basil the Elder or as a Gregory . Among his eight siblings were St. Macrina the Younger , St. Naucratius , St. Peter of Sebaste and St. Basil of Caesarea . The precise number of children in the family was historically contentious : the commentary on 30 May in the Acta Sanctorum , for example , initially states that they were nine , before describing Peter as the tenth child . It has been established that this confusion occurred due to the death of one son in infancy , leading to ambiguities in Gregory 's own writings . Gregory 's parents had suffered persecution for their faith : he writes that they \" had their goods confiscated for confessing Christ . \" Gregory 's maternal grandmother , Macrina the Elder is also revered as a saint and his maternal grandfather was a martyr as Gregory put it \" killed by Imperial wrath \" under the persecution of the Roman Emperor Maximinus II . Between the 320 's to the early 340 's the family rebuilt its fortunes , with Gregory 's father working in the city of Neocaeaseria as an advocate and rhetorician .",

  "The Romans constructed numerous aqueducts . A surviving treatise by Frontinus , who served as curator aquarum ( water commissioner ) under Nerva , reflects the administrative importance placed on ensuring the water supply . Masonry channels carried water from distant springs and reservoirs along a precise gradient , using gravity alone . After the water passed through the aqueduct , it was collected in tanks and fed through pipes to public fountains , baths , toilets , or industrial sites . The main aqueducts in the city of Rome were the Aqua Claudia and the Aqua Marcia . The complex system built to supply Constantinople had its most distant supply drawn from over 120 km away along a sinuous route of more than 336 km . Roman aqueducts were built to remarkably fine tolerance , and to a technological standard that was not to be equalled until modern times . The Romans also made use of aqueducts in their extensive mining operations across the empire , at sites such as Las Medulas and Dolaucothi in South Wales .",

  "Caligari continues to be one of the most discussed and debated films from the Weimar Republic . Two major books have played a large part in shaping the perception of the film and its impact on cinema as a whole : Siegfried Kracauer 's From Caligari to Hitler ( 1947 ) and Lotte Eisner 's The Haunted Screen ( 1974 ) . From Caligari to Hitler based its claims about the film largely on an unpublished typescript by Hans Janowitz called Caligari : The Story of a Famous Story , which gave Janowitz and Carl Mayer principal credit for the making of Caligari . Mike Budd wrote of Kracauer 's book : \" Perhaps no film or period has been so thoroughly understood through a particular interpretation as has Caligari , and Weimar cinema generally , through Kracauer 's social @-@ psychological approach \" . Prior to the publication of From Caligari to Hitler , few critics had derived any symbolic political meaning from the film , but Kracauer ’ s argument that it symbolized German obedience toward authority and a premonition of the rise of Adolf Hitler ( see the Themes section for more ) drastically changed attitudes about Caligari . Many of his interpretations of the film are still embraced , even by those who have strongly disagreed with his general premise , and even as certain claims Kracauer made have been disproven , such as his statement that the original script included no frame story . ( See Writing for more . ) Eisner 's book placed Caligari into historical context by identifying how it influenced Expressionist features in other films of the 1920s .",

  "The heterodyne technique is used for ( 1 ) shifting an input signal into a new frequency range as well as ( 2 ) amplifying a weak input signal ( assuming use of an active mixer ) . A weak input signal of frequency f1 is mixed with a strong reference frequency f2 from a local oscillator ( LO ) . The nonlinear combination of the input signals creates two new signals , one at the sum f1 + f2 of the two frequencies , and the other at the difference f1 − f2 . These new frequencies are called heterodynes . Typically only one of the new frequencies is desired , and the other signal is filtered out of the output of the mixer . The output signal will have an intensity proportional to the product of the amplitudes of the input signals .",

Loring , a Suffolk County probate judge who also served as U.S. commissioner of the Circuit Court in Massachusetts , ordered that Burns be forced back into slavery in Virginia , outraging abolitionists and the increasingly antislavery public in Massachusetts . Under the pressure of a public petition campaign spearheaded by William Lloyd Garrison , the legislature passed two Bills of Address , in 1855 and 1856 , calling for Judge Loring to be removed from his state office , but in both cases Gardner declined to remove Loring . A third Bill of Address to remove Loring from office was later approved by Gardner 's Republican successor , Nathaniel Prentice Banks .",

  "Beneficial properties of the water have been reported for over four hundred years , and the reason for such benefits was a topic of scholarly discussion by 1817 . In the 19th century Malvern became famous for the water cure , resulting in its rapid development from a village to a busy town with many large Victorian and Edwardian hotels . The writings of the hydrotherapists James Gully and James Wilson , and well known patients who included Lord Lytton contributed to Malvern 's renown at that time .

The time when great scouts like Kit Carson , Daniel Boone , and Davy Crockett could explore and master the wild and uncharted Western territories was coming to a close . Contemporary scouts such as Buffalo Bill , Wild Bill Hickok , and Texas Jack Omohundro , were leaving the old West to become entertainers , and they battled great Native American chiefs like Sitting Bull , Chief Joseph , and Geronimo only in Wild West Shows .

There were other considerable advancements in hydraulic engineering and nautical technology during the Song dynasty . The 10th @-@ century invention of the pound lock for canal systems allowed different water levels to be raised and lowered for separated segments of a canal , which significantly aided the safety of canal traffic and allowed for larger barges . There was the Song @-@ era innovation of watertight bulkhead compartments that allowed damage to hulls without sinking the ships . If ships were damaged , the Chinese of the 11th century employed drydocks to repair them while suspended out of the water . The Song used crossbeams to brace the ribs of ships in order to strengthen them in a skeletal @-@ like structure . Stern @-@ mounted rudders had been mounted on Chinese ships since the 1st century , as evidenced with a preserved Han tomb model of a ship . In the Song period , the Chinese devised a way to mechanically raise and lower rudders in order for ships to travel in a wider range of water depths . The Song arranged the protruding teeth of anchors in a circular pattern instead of in one direction . David Graff and Robin Higham state that this arrangement \" [ made ] them more reliable \" for anchoring ships .",

  "Relations between the Liao and the Song were initially peaceful , with the two dynasties exchanging embassies in 974 . Following the collapse of the Tang dynasty , several territories formed small , independent states that were never reunified during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period . Additionally , several additional territories that were controlled by military governors during the Tang dynasty had fallen under the control of local warlords following the Tang collapse .

  "The origins of the tradition of portrait painting in Scotland are in the Renaissance , which began to reach Scotland in the fifteenth century . Portraits were given an important role in Renaissance society , valued as objects , and as depictions of earthly success and status . In Scotland this was particularly through contacts with the Netherlands , generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance . The products of these connections included a fine portrait of William Elphinstone ( 1431 – 1514 ) , Lord Chancellor , Bishop of Aberdeen and founder of the university there . Painted around 1505 , it is one of the earliest representations of a named Scottish subject to survive and was probably painted by a Scots artist using Flemish techniques of oil on wood . Around the same time , Scottish monarchs , like those in England , turned to the recording of royal likenesses in panel portraits , painted in oils on wood , perhaps as a form of political expression . As in England , the monarchy may have had model portraits of royalty used for copies and reproductions , but the versions of native royal portraits that survive are generally crude by continental standards . In 1502 James IV paid for delivery of portraits of the Tudor household , perhaps by the \" Inglishe payntour \" named \" Mynours , \" who stayed in Scotland to paint the king and his new bride Margaret Tudor the following year . \" Mynours \" was Maynard Wewyck , a Flemish painter who usually worked for Henry VII in London . Another Flemish painter , called \" Piers \" , and perhaps Peeken Bovelant , an apprentice of an Antwerp painter Goswijn van der Weyden , was brought to Scotland by Andrew Halyburton , the trading agent in Middelburg , in September 1505 . No details are known of his work , except his assistance in painting costumes and heraldry for tournaments , but the king gave him a salary and accommodation , and it is likely that Piers made portraits for the court . Piers returned to Flanders from Inverkeithing in July 1508 . Some references in the royal accounts call him a \" Frenchman \" .",

At Eidos ' request , Rocksteady presented their approach to the Batman license , and by May 2007 , they had begun developing the game 's concept , with full production beginning in September . Writer Paul Dini ( Batman : The Animated Series , Detective Comics ) was first approached by DC Comics around late 2007 about the prospect of creating a story for an original Batman video game . Dini found the idea intriguing , believing that few Batman games were based on an original idea , instead being adapted from film or television . DC Comics asked Dini what his approach to writing a new Batman film or graphic novel would be , but one that was designed for gameplay . He later met with the Rocksteady team , where it was decided that Dini 's ideas were in line with what Rocksteady wanted to achieve . By the time Dini joined the project , Rocksteady were investigating the idea of setting the game within Arkham , and had produced preliminary designs depicting it as a huge estate on an island connected to mainland Gotham City by a bridge . The cast had not been finalized , but given the setting it was certain that the Joker would play a large role .

The British military commanders in Singapore had believed that the Japanese attack would come by sea from the south , since the dense Malayan jungle in the north would serve as a natural barrier against invasion . Although they had drawn up a plan for dealing with an attack on northern Malaya , preparations were never completed .

  "This form of protective mimicry occurs in the genus Passiflora . The leaves of this plant contain toxins that deter herbivorous animals — however some Heliconius butterfly larvae have evolved enzymes that break down these toxins , allowing them to specialize on this genus . This has created further selection pressure on the host plants , which have evolved stipules that mimic mature Heliconius eggs near the point of hatching . These butterflies tend to avoid laying eggs near each existing ones , which helps avoid exploitative intraspecific competition between caterpillars — those that lay on vacant leaves provide their offspring with a greater chance of survival . Most Heliconius larvae are cannibalistic , meaning that on leaves older eggs hatch first and eat the new arrivals . Thus , it seems that such plants have evolved egg dummies due to these grazing herbivore enemies . In addition , the decoy eggs are also nectaries , attracting predators of the caterpillars such as ants and wasps . This acts as a further defense of the plant against the caterpillars .",

  "Hakluyt prepared an English translation of Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius ' Mare Liberum ( 1609 ) , a treatise that sought to demonstrate that the Dutch had the right to trade freely in the East Indies , contrary to Spanish and Portuguese claims of sovereignty over the seas , in the early 17th century . Helen Thornton has suggested that the translation was commissioned by Thomas Smythe who became treasurer of the Virginia Company in 1609 and was also Governor of the East India Company . In that year , Hakluyt was a consultant to the Company when it was renewing its charter . Grotius ' arguments supported England 's right to trade in the Indies . The translation may also have been part of the propaganda encouraging English people to settle in Virginia . In Mare Liberum , Grotius denied that the 1493 donation by Pope Alexander VI that had divided the oceans between Spain and Portugal entitled Spain to make territorial claims to North America . Instead , he stressed the importance of occupation , which was favourable to the English as they and not the Spanish had occupied Virginia . Grotius also argued that the seas should be freely navigable by all , which was useful since the England to Virginia route crossed seas which the Portuguese claimed . However , it is not clear why Hakluyt 's translation was not published in his lifetime . George Bruner Parks has theorized that publication at that time would have been inconvenient to England because after England had successfully helped Holland and Spain to negotiate the Twelve Years ' Truce during the Eighty Years ' War , the work would have supported English claims for free seas against Spain , but not its claims for closed seas against Holland . Hakluyt 's handwritten manuscript , MS Petyt 529 , in Inner Temple Library in London was eventually published as The Free Sea for the first time in 2004 .",

  "The Mark 1A Fire Control Computer ( pictured ) was an electro @-@ mechanical analog ballistic computer . Its function was to automatically aim the guns so that a fired projectile would collide with the target . This was the same function as the main battery 's Mk 8 Rangekeeper above except that some of the targets the Mark 1A had to deal with also moved in elevation — and much faster . For a surface target , the Secondary Battery 's Fire Control problem is the same as the Main Battery 's with the same type inputs and outputs . The major difference between the two computers was their ballistics calculations . The amount of gun elevation needed to project a 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) shell 9 nmi ( 17 km ) is different than the elevation needed to project a 16 @-@ inch shell the same distance . The ballistics calculations in these mechanical analog computers were performed by mechanisms like differential gears , levers , and small rods riding on the surface of three @-@ dimensional cams . These mechanical adders , multipliers , and table lookup devices were handmade at the factory , and were buried deep in the workings of the computer . It was not possible to change a computer 's ballistics at sea until the advent of fast digital computers . The anti @-@ aircraft fire control problem was more complicated because it had the additional requirement of tracking the target in elevation and making target predictions in three dimensions . The outputs of the Mk 1A were the same ( gun bearing and elevation ) , except fuze time was added . The fuze time was needed because the ideal of directly hitting the fast moving aircraft with the projectile was impractical . With fuze time set into the shell , it was hoped that it would explode near enough to the target to destroy it with the shock wave and shrapnel . Towards the end of World War II , the invention of the VT proximity fuze eliminated the need to use the fuze time calculation and its possible error . This greatly increased the odds of destroying an air target .",

  "Life on Earth is based on carbon and water . Carbon provides stable frameworks for complex chemicals and can be easily extracted from the environment , especially from carbon dioxide .

The elements boron and phosphorus have more complex chemistries , but suffer from other limitations relative to carbon . Water is an excellent solvent and has two other useful properties : the fact that ice floats enables aquatic organisms to survive beneath it in winter ; and its molecules have electrically negative and positive ends , which enables it to form a wider range of compounds than other solvents can . Other good solvents , such as ammonia , are liquid only at such low temperatures that chemical reactions may be too slow to sustain life , and lack water 's other advantages .

  "The Early Neolithic people of Britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears had done . Many archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead , believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants . Archaeologist Robin Holgate stressed that rather than simply being tombs , the Medway Megaliths were \" communal mouments fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them . \" Thus , it has furthermore been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs – which doubled as temples or shrines – to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance .

  "Experiments conducted by the Franklin Institute , Boston , in the 1830s had initially cast doubt on the practice of adding water as soon as the escape of steam through the device was noted . A steam boiler was fitted with a small observation window of glass and heated beyond its normal operating temperature with the water level below the top of the firebox . When water was added it was found that the pressure rose suddenly and the observation glass shattered . The report concluded that the high temperature of the metal had vaporised the added water too quickly and that an explosion was the inevitable result . It was not until 1852 that this assumption was challenged : Thomas Redmond , one of the Institute 's own inspectors , specifically ruled out this theory in his investigation into the boiler explosion on the steam ship Redstone on the Ohio River on 3 April that year . A 1907 investigation in Wales came to a similar conclusion : a steam locomotive belonging to the Rhymney Railway was inadvertently sent out with its safety valves wrongly assembled . The pressure in the boiler built up to the extent that the injectors failed ; the crown sheet became uncovered , was weakened by the heat of the fire and violently blew apart . The investigation , led by Colonel Druitt of the Railway Inspectorate , dismissed the theory that the enginemen had succeeded in starting the injectors and that the sudden flood of cold water had caused such a generation of steam that the boiler burst . He quoted the results of experiments by the Manchester Steam Users ' Association , a national boiler certification and insurance body , that proved that the weight of copper present ( considered with its specific heat ) was insufficient to generate enough steam to raise the boiler pressure at all . Indeed , the addition of cold water had caused the pressure to fall . From then on it was accepted that the correct action in the event of the operation of the fusible plug was to add water .",

  "Ralambo is credited with introducing the tradition of polygamy in Imerina . The Merina legend of the origin of this practice was recorded in the 19th @-@ century collection of Merina andriana oral history and genealogy entitled Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara . According to this source , Ralambo had already married once when his servant encountered the beautiful princess Rafotsimarobavina and four female companions gathering edible greens in a valley west of Ambohidrabiby . Upon hearing of her beauty , Ralambo instructed the servant to make her a marriage offer on his behalf . The servant asked three times , and each time the princess refused to give her consent , instead replying \" If Ralambo is king and I am queen . \" The fourth time , after Ralambo had instructed his servant to carry her to him by force , the princess agreed to marry on the condition that it be done properly with the consent of her parents , a condition to which the king agreed . Ralambo then informed his first wife of his intention to marry again , to which she replied , \" I approve your decision , \" and the marriage was made . Ralambo ultimately took four wives in total : Rafotsitohina , Rafotsiramarobavina , Ratsitohinina and Rafotsindrindra . These marriages produced three daughters and twelve sons , the eldest of whom , Andriantompokoindrindra , was passed over for Ralambo 's succession in favor of his second son , Andrianjaka .",

  "The royal prerogative is in much use in the realm of foreign affairs . It is the monarch who recognises foreign states ( although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives ) , issues declarations of war and peace , and forms international treaties . The monarch also has the power to annex territory , as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall . Once territory has been annexed , the monarch has complete discretion as to the extent to which the government will take over the former government 's liabilities ; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King . The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory . Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful , in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights . When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890 , Parliamentary approval was first sought . The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council .

  "A biological membrane is a form of lamellar phase lipid bilayer . The formation of lipid bilayers is an energetically preferred process when the glycerophospholipids described above are in an aqueous environment . This is known as the hydrophobic effect . In an aqueous system , the polar heads of lipids align towards the polar , aqueous environment , while the hydrophobic tails minimize their contact with water and tend to cluster together , forming a vesicle ; depending on the concentration of the lipid , this biophysical interaction may result in the formation of micelles , liposomes , or lipid bilayers . Other aggregations are also observed and form part of the polymorphism of amphiphile ( lipid ) behavior . Phase behavior is an area of study within biophysics and is the subject of current academic research . Micelles and bilayers form in the polar medium by a process known as the hydrophobic effect . When dissolving a lipophilic or amphiphilic substance in a polar environment , the polar molecules ( i.e. , water in an aqueous solution ) become more ordered around the dissolved lipophilic substance , since the polar molecules cannot form hydrogen bonds to the lipophilic areas of the amphiphile . So in an aqueous environment , the water molecules form an ordered \" clathrate \" cage around the dissolved lipophilic molecule .",
  "Unlike the steppe polecat , the European polecat has a much more settled way of life , with definite home ranges . The characteristics of polecat home ranges vary according to season , habitat , sex and social status . Breeding females settle in discrete areas , whereas breeding males and dispersing juveniles have more fluid ranges , being more mobile . Males typically have larger territories than females . Each polecat uses several den sites distributed throughout its territory . Occasionally , abandoned European badger or red fox burrows are used . Rabbit warrens are often areas of intense polecat activity . In winter , the polecat may use farm buildings or haystacks as daytime resting sites . The polecat is not as territorial as other small mustelids , having been known to share territories with other members of the same sex . Evidence of polecats marking their territories is sparse . Like other mustelids , the polecat is usually a silent animal , though it will growl fiercely when angered , and squeak when distressed . It also emits a low , mewling cry to its mate or offspring .",

An upper level high north of Guam allowed for further development . Moving north , the system detached from the monsoon trough , and it became a tropical depression on September 28 . Southerly shear across the system led to an initially subtropical appearance , as thunderstorms moved away from the center . This also prevented significant development . On September 29 , the main belt of the Westerlies captured the cyclone , displacing thunderstorms even farther east of the center . With the low level circulation exposed , Nina weakened into a tropical depression . By late on September 30 , the low level circulation moved back under the convection , which resulted in reintensification back to a tropical storm at the same time Maury was absorbed into its circulation . By late morning October 1 , Nina reached its maximum intensity , but extratropical transition was already underway . Central convection decreased , and Nina became an extratropical cyclone by October 2 .",

When the crisis finally hit the country , the rupiah 's plunge severely disrupted corporate operations . Numerous conglomerates lost a majority of their assets and collapsed . Over the next several years , other conglomerates struggled to repay international and domestic debts . Reforms introduced following 1998 were meant to steer the economy away from oligarchic arrangements established under the New Order ; however , plans for reform proved too optimistic . When President B. J. Habibie announced in a 19 July 1998 interview with The Washington Post that Indonesia was not dependent on ethnic Chinese businessmen , the rupiah 's value plunged 5 percent . This unexpected reaction prompted immediate changes in policies , and Habibie soon began enticing conglomerates for their support in the reform plans . Most were initially fearful of democratization , but the process of social demarginalization meant that the ethnic Chinese were regarded as equal members of society for the first time in the nation 's history . Increased regional autonomy allowed surviving conglomerates to explore new opportunities in the outer provinces , and economic reforms created a freer market .",

  "Two classes of verbs can be differentiated on the basis of their behaviour in aspectually marked sentences . One class of verbs has two aspectually distinct forms , as seen in the above example sentences . Another class of verbs does not distinguish aspect — one and the same form shows up in both completive and continuative aspect . In sentences in the recent past tense , this gives rise to ambiguity since the preverbal continuative particle is omitted there . Thus , the sentence kòfí blú can be interpreted in the following two ways :",

  "Similarly , the sacred meals shared by the initiates of many mystery cults have been compared with the Christian rite of communion . For instance , the classicist R. E. Witt called the banquet that concluded the Isiac initiation \" the pagan Eucharist of Isis and Sarapis \" . However , feasts in which worshippers ate the food that had been sacrificed to a deity were a nearly universal practice in Mediterranean religions and do not prove a direct link between Christianity and the mystery cults . The most distinctive trait of Christian communion — the belief that the god himself was the victim of the sacrifice — was not present in the mystery cults .",

  "The species was described as new to science by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H. Smith , based on specimens collected in Nor Yungas Province , Bolivia , on the road to La Paz to Coroico . They published a short description in Latin in a 1958 Mycologia publication , followed by a more detailed description in English later that year . According to Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán , the species Psilocybe acutissima ( described by Roger Heim in 1958 ) , and Psilocybe isauri ( described by Singer in 1959 ) are synonyms , as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the type material of all three . Singer considered P. isauri a species distinct from P. yungensis because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface . Smith named the variety P. yungensis var. diconica for specimens he found with conical , rather than obconical ( the form of an inverted cone ) papilla . Similarly , the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to P. acutissima was a papillate cap ( somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast ) . Later studies showed that these morphological variations did not warrant individual recognition , because of the variable nature of these characteristics , and the existence of intermediate forms .",

With the start of the Napoleonic Wars in 1803 , French reinforcements for the garrison on Haiti were delayed and intercepted by the British Royal Navy , who blockaded the island and took the surrenders of the last garrisons in 1804 , removing them and their dependents to prevent a massacre . Dessalines rapidly established himself as monarch of Haiti , but his reign was cut short in 1806 when his closest advisors , Henri Christophe and Alexandre Pétion organised his assassination . Assuming control of Haiti , Christophe laid claim to the northern part of the country and Pétion the south , the two sides waging a constant low @-@ level civil war during the next decade . Many minor rulers sprang up during this period , especially in the south , where Pétion gave parcels of land for his followers to establish their own private fiefdoms . One such warlord was Jérôme Maximilien Borgella , who took over command of a small state in the region of Léogane following the death of its ruler , André Rigaud .",

  "The episode received mixed to positive reviews from critics . Todd VanDerWerff , writing for The A.V. Club , rated \" Max \" an A − . VanDerWerff was unconvinced that the episode , along with \" Tempus Fugit \" , merited being stretched over two parts ; however , he felt that the character of Fenig was \" a simultaneous paean to the many , many lives lost in this fictional war and a very real story about someone who could very well live on the edges of our society , driven mad by visions that are only real to himself , visions the rest of us would immediately disregard as unbelievable and surreal \" . Paula Vitaris , writing for Cinefantastique , rated \" Max \" one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . Vitaris praised the episode 's visual effects ; however , she felt that the two parts of the story would have better served as \" a taut one @-@ hour episode \" .

  "The second chapter , \" The Great Experiment \" , continues the examination of Stone Age progress by looking at the advancements in hunting . Wright uses the term \" progress trap \" to refer to innovations that create new problems for which the society is unable or unwilling to solve , or inadvertently create conditions that are worse than what existed before the innovation . For example , innovations in hunting during the Stone Age allowed for more successful hunts and consequently more free time during which culture and art were created ( e.g. cave paintings , bone carvings , etc . ) , but also led to extinctions , most notably of megafauna . As smaller and smaller game were hunted to replace larger extinct animals , the hunts became less successful and culture declined .

  "Water security and food security are inextricably linked . In the decade 1951 – 60 human water withdrawals were four times greater than the previous decade . This rapid increase resulted from scientific and technological developments impacting through the economy – especially the increase in irrigated land , growth in industrial and power sectors , and intensive dam construction on all continents . This altered the water cycle of rivers and lakes , affected their water quality and had a significant impact on the global water cycle . Currently towards 35 % of human water use is unsustainable , drawing on diminishing aquifers and reducing the flows of major rivers : this percentage is likely to increase if climate change impacts become more severe , populations increase , aquifers become progressively depleted and supplies become polluted and unsanitary . From 1961 to 2001 water demand doubled — agricultural use increased by 75 % , industrial use by more than 200 % , and domestic use more than 400 % .

  "Its most noticeable effect is due to its first unique feature : flavor changing . A neutron , for example , is heavier than a proton ( its sister nucleon ) , but it cannot decay into a proton without changing the flavor ( type ) of one of its two down quarks to an up quark . Neither the strong interaction nor electromagnetism permit flavour changing , so this proceeds by weak decay ; without weak decay , quark properties such as strangeness and charm ( associated with the quarks of the same name ) would also be conserved across all interactions . All mesons are unstable because of weak decay . In the process known as beta decay , a down quark in the neutron can change into an up quark by emitting a virtual W − boson which is then converted into an electron and an electron antineutrino . Another example is the electron capture , a common variant of radioactive decay , wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact , and are changed to a neutron ( an up quark is changed to a down quark ) and an electron neutrino is emitted .",

  "The keel for Conte Verde was laid down at the San Rocco shipyard in Livorno on 2 February 1863 . She was launched on 29 July 1867 , and was completed in December 1871 . The ship did not have a long or particularly active career ; rapidly surpassed first by central battery and then turret ships , the first generation of ironclads with traditional broadside quickly became obsolete . In addition , the Italian government lost confidence in the fleet after its defeat in 1866 at the Battle of Lissa and drastically reduced the naval budget . The cuts were so severe that the fleet had great difficulty in mobilizing its ironclad squadron to attack the port of Civitavecchia in September 1870 , as part of the wars of Italian unification . Instead , the ships were laid up and the sailors conscripted to man them were sent home .",

  "Two musical themes in Wicked run throughout the score . Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works , the first – Elphaba 's theme – came from The Survival of St. Joan , on which he worked as musical director . \" I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it , \" he remarked in an interview in 2004 . The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show 's orchestration . By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance , Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods . In the overture , the tune is carried by the orchestra 's brass section , with heavy percussion . The result is , in Schwartz ' own words , \" like a giant shadow terrorizing you \" .

  "The duplication and transmission of genetic material from one generation of cells to the next is the basis for molecular inheritance , and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes . Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents ' cells . In asexually reproducing organisms , the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism . In sexually reproducing organisms , a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid , or contain only one copy of each gene . The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova , and those produced by males are called sperm . Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg , a single cell that has two sets of genes , with one copy of each gene from the mother and one from the father .",

  "Two years later against Plum Warner 's MCC team , there were further calls for Marsh to be selected for the Test team as Australia fell 1 – 2 behind in the Ashes . Marsh had taken 5 / 55 against the Englishmen in a match at Bathurst , delivering a mixture of fast bowling and off spin . His victims included George Hirst and Warner himself . No formal complaint about Marsh 's bowling was lodged by the English but his bowling did raise eyebrows . The general consensus among the English touring party was that Marsh 's bowling was unfair , with Warner describing him as a \" shier \" , a 19th @-@ century term for a thrower . Warner asserted that no English umpire would tolerate such a bowling action . Despite this , the English players described him as the best bowler that they had faced on the tour . Warner and Noble were confident that Crockett would no @-@ ball Marsh out of the match if the Australian Test selectors picked the bowler . As a result , Marsh was effectively excluded from the Australian side and his first @-@ class career was limited to just six matches in which he took 34 wickets at an average of 21 @.@ 47 . The Australian Test batsman and captain Warren Bardsley rated Marsh alongside Fred Spofforth and England 's Sydney Barnes . The comparison to Barnes was praise indeed ; Barnes was the only bowler in Test history with over 120 wickets to have a bowling average under 20 , with 189 wickets at an average of just 16 @.@ 43 . Bardsley said that the only reason that Marsh was \" kept ... out of big cricket was his color \" . Jack Pollard said that Marsh \" was clearly the best Australian bowler of his time but unfortunately that was a period when the White Australia policy prevailed . Marsh 's name was scratched from the list of players ... by an official who was simply carrying out the racist customs of the day . \"",

  "The restrictions on Shostakovich 's music and living arrangements were eased in 1949 , when Stalin decided that the Soviets needed to send artistic representatives to the Cultural and Scientific Congress for World Peace in New York City , and that Shostakovich should be amongst them . For Shostakovich , it was a humiliating experience culminating in a New York press conference where he was expected to read a prepared speech . Nicolas Nabokov , who was present in the audience , witnessed Shostakovich starting to read \" in a nervous and shaky voice \" before he had to break off \" and the speech was continued in English by a suave radio baritone \" . Fully aware that Shostakovich was not free to speak his mind , Nabokov publicly asked the composer whether he supported the then recent denunciation of Stravinsky 's music in the Soviet Union . Shostakovich , who was a great admirer of Stravinsky and had been influenced by his music , had no alternative but to answer in the affirmative . Nabokov did not hesitate to publish that this demonstrated that Shostakovich was \" not a free man , but an obedient tool of his government . \" Shostakovich never forgave Nabokov for this public humiliation . That same year Shostakovich was obliged to compose the cantata Song of the Forests , which praised Stalin as the \" great gardener . \" In 1951 the composer was made a deputy to the Supreme Soviet of RSFSR .",

  "The sequence of nucleotides in a gene is read and translated by a cell to produce a chain of amino acids which in turn folds into a protein . The order of amino acids in a protein corresponds to the order of nucleotides in the gene . This relationship between nucleotide sequence and amino acid sequence is known as the genetic code . The amino acids in a protein determine how it folds into its unique three @-@ dimensional shape , a structure that is ultimately responsible for the protein 's function . Proteins carry out many of the functions needed for cells to live . A change to the DNA in a gene can alter a protein 's amino acid sequence , thereby changing its shape and function and rendering the protein ineffective or even malignant ( e.g. sickle cell anemia ) . Changes to genes are called mutations .",

  "Money for a naval building program was allocated in 1910 . Although the Chilean government solicited bids from several armament companies , nearly all believed that a British company would win the contract ; the American naval attaché opined that without anything short of a revolution the contracts were destined for the United Kingdom . The Chilean Navy had cultivated extensive ties with the United Kingdom 's Royal Navy since the 1830s , when Chilean naval officers were given places on British ships to receive training and experience they could bring back to their country .

  "Koht spoke of language in a social context in general and of the class struggle in particular . He eventually used the Labour Party as a vehicle for his language activism , especially after being asked by the party to write Arbeidarreising og målspørsmål in 1921 . In it , he synthesised the class struggle and language struggle in Norway , and because he was an integrationist he wanted a popular gathering around one written language . Koht became a member of Rettskrivingsnemnda in 1934 , and in 1936 the Labour Party agreed that a language reform should be carried out , moving the two language forms Bokmål and Nynorsk closer to one another . The language reforms took place in 1938 and promoted the Samnorsk ideal . The reforms were reversed in 1941 under Nazi rule ; the original changes were reinstated after the end of the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany . According to historian Kåre Lunden , Koht was much hated by many because of his language reforms , which were routinely perceived as attacks and degradations on their preferred language . His ideals were dubbed \" det kohtske knot \" , i.e. \" the Kohtian mishmash \" . For his own part , Koht often used spellings that contrasted with both Nynorsk and Bokmål .

  "Soule was promptly given the task by Square to score Secret of Evermore . The finished game features an untraditional score incorporating ambient background sounds ( like wind blowing and ocean waves ) into the music and utilizing a more mellow orchestral sound . Part of the reason for this was that the sound program used in Evermore was not up to the technical challenge of what Soule wanted to do with it , forcing him to work creatively within his limitations . When Ron Gilbert of LucasArts left to form his own company , Humongous Entertainment , and Square moved from Seattle to Los Angeles , Soule quit Square to score Gilbert 's children 's adventure game series , Putt @-@ Putt ; he was the company 's third employee .

After Henry II mottes ceased to be built in most of England , although they continued to be erected in Wales and along the Marches . Square keeps remained common across much of England in contrast to the circular keeps increasingly prevailing in France ; in the Marches , however , circular keep designs became more popular . Castles began to take on a more regular , enclosed shape , ideally quadrilateral or at least polygonal in design , especially in the more prosperous south . Flanking towers , initially square and latterly curved , were introduced along the walls and gatehouses began to grow in size and complexity , with portcullises being introduced for the first time .

Finally on 9 August Milne was given clear orders to \" chase Goeben which had passed Cape Matapan on the 7th steering north @-@ east . \" Milne still did not believe that Souchon was heading for the Dardanelles , and so he resolved to guard the exit from the Aegean , unaware that the Goeben did not intend to come out .

Later that day , a ship report in the eastern eyewall reported a minimum central pressure of 965 mbar ( 28 @.@ 5 inHg ) and maximum sustained winds of 160 km / h ( 100 mph ) , making Michael a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane scale . The sudden intensification was determined to have been as a result of baroclinic effects as it interacted with an incoming trough , which provided additional energy to counter the general weakening of hurricanes while in the high latitudes over sea @-@ surface temperatures around 16 ° C ( 61 ° F ) . Michael formed a \" hybrid \" system combining influences of a hurricane with that of a powerful extratropical cyclone . Shortly before 0000 UTC on October 20 , Michael made landfall near Harbour Breton , Newfoundland with winds of 135 km / h ( 85 mph ) . Either simultaneously or shortly thereafter , Michael transitioned into an extratropical storm . The extratropical system gradually weakened as it tracked across Newfoundland on October 20 , and slowed down considerably with the presence of the trough . The storm was absorbed by another extratropical low just north of Newfoundland that afternoon .",
