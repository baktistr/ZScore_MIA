  "The Andean condor is a national symbol of Argentina , Bolivia , Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru and Venezuelan Andes states . It is the national bird of Bolivia , Chile , Colombia , and Ecuador . It plays an important role in the folklore and mythology of the South American Andean regions , and has been represented in Andean art from c . 2500 BCE onward , and they are a part of indigenous Andean religions . In Andean mythology , the Andean condor was associated with the sun deity , and was believed to be the ruler of the upper world . The Andean condor is considered a symbol of power and health by many Andean cultures , and it was believed that the bones and organs of the Andean condor possessed medicinal powers , sometimes leading to the hunting and killing of condors to obtain its bones and organs . In some versions of Peruvian bullfighting , a condor is tied to the back of a bull , where it pecks at the animal as bullfighters fight it . The condor generally survives and is set free .",

  "Trujillo and colleagues have placed upper limits in Sedna 's surface composition of 60 % for methane ice and 70 % for water ice . The presence of methane further supports the existence of tholins on Sedna 's surface , because they are produced by irradiation of methane . Barucci and colleagues compared Sedna 's spectrum with that of Triton and detected weak absorption bands belonging to methane and nitrogen ices . From these observations , they suggested the following model of the surface : 24 % Triton @-@ type tholins , 7 % amorphous carbon , 10 % nitrogen , 26 % methanol , and 33 % methane . The detection of methane and water ices was confirmed in 2006 by the Spitzer Space Telescope mid @-@ infrared photometry . The presence of nitrogen on the surface suggests the possibility that , at least for a short time , Sedna may have a tenuous atmosphere . During a 200 @-@ year period near perihelion , the maximum temperature on Sedna should exceed 35 @.@ 6 K ( − 237 @.@ 6 ° C ) , the transition temperature between alpha @-@ phase solid N2 and the beta phase seen on Triton . At 38 K , the N2 vapor pressure would be 14 microbar ( 1 @.@ 4 Pa or 0 @.@ 000014 atm ) . However , its deep red spectral slope is indicative of high concentrations of organic material on its surface , and its weak methane absorption bands indicate that methane on Sedna 's surface is ancient , rather than freshly deposited . This means that Sedna is too cold for methane to evaporate from its surface and then fall back as snow , which happens on Triton and probably on Pluto .",

  "The common explanation for the ship 's name was that it was inspired by Henry VIII 's favourite sister , Mary Tudor , and the rose as the emblem of the Tudors .

  "Phase shifting interferometry overcomes these limitations by not relying on finding fringe centers , but rather by collecting intensity data from every point of the CCD image sensor . As seen in Fig . 17 , multiple interferograms ( at least three ) are analyzed with the reference optical surface shifted by a precise fraction of a wavelength between each exposure using a piezoelectric transducer ( PZT ) . Alternatively , precise phase shifts can be introduced by modulating the laser frequency . The captured images are processed by a computer to calculate the optical wavefront errors . The precision and reproducibility of PSI is far greater than possible in static interferogram analysis , with measurement repeatabilities of a hundredth of a wavelength being routine .

A few species feed in the leaf litter ; for example , the wing @-@ banded antbird forages in areas of dense leaf @-@ litter . It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter , as do some other birds ; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly ( never picking them up ) .

  "The absence of distinct currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks , although the imposition of transfer restrictions in 2012 – 13 Cypriot financial crisis means that the situation is not quite so simple . The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones . Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost .

  "Contemporary critics discuss a clear progression over the course of Salinger 's published work , as evidenced by the increasingly negative reviews received by each of his three post @-@ Catcher story collections . Ian Hamilton adheres to this view , arguing that while Salinger 's early stories for the \" slicks \" boasted \" tight , energetic \" dialogue , they had also been formulaic and sentimental . It took the standards of The New Yorker editors , among them William Shawn , to refine his writing into the \" spare , teasingly mysterious , withheld \" qualities of \" A Perfect Day for Bananafish \" ( 1948 ) , The Catcher in the Rye , and his stories of the early 1950s . By the late 1950s , as Salinger became more reclusive and involved in religious study , Hamilton notes that his stories became longer , less plot @-@ driven , and increasingly filled with digression and parenthetical remarks . Louis Menand agrees , writing in The New Yorker that Salinger \" stopped writing stories , in the conventional sense ...

  "The Missouri Fox Trotter performs an ambling gait known as the \" fox trot \" , which replaces the trot seen in many other breeds . The fox trot is a four @-@ beat broken diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind , eliminating the moment of suspension and giving a smooth , sure @-@ footed ride . The gait is sometimes described as having the horse walk with the front feet and trot with the back .

The fox trot and the regular trot are both at a speed between a walk and a canter or gallop ; ambling gaits are four @-@ beat gaits , whereas the trot is a two @-@ beat gait . The extra footfalls provide additional smoothness to a rider because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground . This minimizes movement of the horse 's topline and removes the bounce of a two @-@ beat gait , caused by a moment of suspension followed by the jolt of two feet hitting the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other .

With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board he blasted his way into parts of the wreck . Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations , but there was no evidence that Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels . Deane reported retrieving a bilge pump and the lower part of the main mast , both of which would have been located inside the ship . The recovery of small wooden objects like longbows , suggest that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point , though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader Margaret Rule . Newspaper reports on Deane 's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was clinker built , but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature , an alternative explanation has been suggested : Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship , but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist . Despite the rough handling by Deane the Mary Rose escaped the wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent .",

Davidson says that \" it would hardly be surprising if strange legends grew up about such women , who must have been kept apart from their kind due to their gruesome duties . Since it was often decided by lot which prisoners should be killed , the idea that the god \" chose \" his victims , through the instrument of the priestesses , must have been a familiar one , apart from the obvious assumption that some were chosen to fall in war . \" Davidson says that it appears that from \" early times \" the Germanic peoples \" believed in fierce female spirits doing the command of the war god , stirring up disorder , taking part in battle , seizing and perhaps devouring the slain . \"",

  "In response to Dunmore 's proclamation , Virginia 's assembly ordered its troops to march on Norfolk . William Woodford , the colonel leading the Continental Army 's 2nd Virginia Regiment , advanced toward the bridge with his regiment of 400 and about 100 riflemen from the Culpeper Minutemen . On December 2 they arrived at the bridge and set up a camp across the bridge from the British fort . Upon their arrival the British set about destroying buildings near the fort to ensure a clear field of fire . Woodford was at first unwilling to assault the British position , due to a lack of cannons and an overly generous estimate of the garrison 's strength . He therefore began entrenching the position on his side of the bridge , while more and more militia companies arrived from the surrounding counties and North Carolina . Some cannons eventually arrived with a contingent of North Carolina men , but they were useless because they lacked mountings and carriages . Woodford also became concerned when he heard rumors that a large number of Scottish Highlanders had joined Dunmore 's forces . The rumors were partly true : the Highlanders were in fact 120 families , but few of the men were skilled at arms . By December 8 , the force in the Whig camp had grown to nearly 900 , with more than 700 fit for duty .",

  "Tyrannosaurus rex brain structure has also been analyzed , and Tarbosaurus was similar , differing only in the positions of some cranial nerve roots , including the trigeminal and accessory nerves .

The total brain volume for a 12 meter ( 40 ft ) Tarbosaurus is estimated at only 184 cubic centimeters ( 11 @.@ 2 cu in ) . The large size of the olfactory bulbs , as well as the terminal and olfactory nerves , suggest that Tarbosaurus had a keen sense of smell , as was also the case with Tyrannosaurus . The vomeronasal bulb is large and differentiated from the olfactory bulb , indicating a well @-@ developed Jacobsen 's organ , which was used to detect pheromones . This may imply that Tarbosaurus had complex mating behavior .

Unlike Tyrannosaurus , which had forward @-@ facing eyes that provided some degree of binocular vision , Tarbosaurus had a narrower skull more typical of other tyrannosaurids in which the eyes faced primarily sideways .

  "Immediately following the Soviet occupation of Lithuania , The Internationale replaced the Tautiška giesmė . When in 1944 ' The Internationale ' have been replaced by State Anthem of the Soviet Union in Soviet Union as official anthem , Tautiška giesmė was used as official anthem for the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic . An alternate anthem was created and introduced in 1950 . The music for that piece was composed by Balys Dvarionas and Jonas Švedas , and the words were written originally by Antanas Venclova . Following Stalin 's death in 1953 , its lyrics were modified by Vacys Reimeris to remove reference to the former dictator . This anthem stated that Lenin had lit the path to freedom , helped by the Russian people , and exhorted the Lithuanian people to work with peoples of the other Soviet Republics . The anthem was confirmed in Article 169 of the 1978 Constitution of the Lithuanian SSR . The song continued to be used until Lithuania broke away from the Soviet Union . Already in 1988 , the Tautiška giesmė was suggested as a replacement for the Soviet Lithuanian anthem . After preliminary approval by the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian SSR and successive legislative bodies , its status as the national anthem was reconfirmed in 1992 .

The last law in relation to the national anthem was passed in 1999 ; it contained the official lyrics and protocol on how and when to play the anthem .",

  "The households of medieval peasant families were naturally smaller than those of the aristocracy , and as such resembled modern households more . The patterns of marriage fluctuated greatly over the course of the Middle Ages . Even though most of the available evidence concerns the higher classes , and the source material for southern Europe is richer than for the rest , it is still possible to make some rough generalisations . It seems clear that the average age of marriage during the Early Middle Ages was comparatively high , in the early twenties , and quite equal for men and women . The reason for this can be found in traditions brought forward from the Germanic tribes , but equally in the fact that habitation was confined to small areas , a factor that enforced restrictions on population growth . As more land was won for cultivation , this trend changed . During the High and Late Middle Ages , women were increasingly married away in their teens , leading to higher birth rates . While women would be married once they reached reproductive age , men had to possess independent means of sustenance – to be able to provide for a family – before entering into marriage . For this reason , the average age of marriage for men remained high , in the mid- to late twenties .",

After the show was initially announced on October 10 , 1986 , Roddenberry put together a production team which included staff members from the original series such as Robert H. Justman . The show utilized some existing sets and props from the Star Trek films and both Star Trek : The Original Series and Star Trek : Phase II . New actors were hired for the pilot , which in some cases required the character concepts to be redeveloped to better fit the actor . Marina Sirtis and Denise Crosby were hired for the roles of Macha Hernandez and Deanna Troi respectively , but were later switched by Roddenberry and Crosby 's new role renamed to Tasha Yar . DeForest Kelley agreed to appear in a cameo role in the pilot but as a gesture to Roddenberry , he refused to be paid more than the minimum possible salary . The show made its debut in syndication to a mixed critical response , an assessment which was upheld by critics reassessing the episode following the end of the entire series .",

Having never fouled out in his career – a feat that he was very proud of – he played aggressive defense despite the risk of fouling out , and blocked two of Lucas ' shots in overtime , proving those wrong who said he only played for his own stats ; he ended scoring a game @-@ high 27 points . But in that game , he fell on his right hand , and was said to have \" sprained \" it ; it was actually broken . For Game 5 , Chamberlain 's hands were packed into thick pads normally destined for defensive linesmen in American Football ; he was offered a painkilling shot , but refused because he feared he would lose his shooting touch if his hands became numb . In Game 5 , Chamberlain recorded 24 points , 29 rebounds , eight assists and eight blocked shots . ( While blocked shots were not an official NBA stat at that time , announcer Keith Jackson counted the blocks during the broadcast . ) Chamberlain 's outstanding all @-@ around performance helped the Lakers win their first championship in Los Angeles with a decisive 114 – 100 win . Chamberlain was named Finals MVP , and was admired for dominating the Knicks in Game 5 while playing injured .",

  "In 1609 , Galileo Galilei drew one of the first telescopic drawings of the Moon in his book Sidereus Nuncius and noted that it was not smooth but had mountains and craters . Telescopic mapping of the Moon followed : later in the 17th century , the efforts of Giovanni Battista Riccioli and Francesco Maria Grimaldi led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today . The more exact 1834 – 36 Mappa Selenographica of Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler , and their associated 1837 book Der Mond , the first trigonometrically accurate study of lunar features , included the heights of more than a thousand mountains , and introduced the study of the Moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography . Lunar craters , first noted by Galileo , were thought to be volcanic until the 1870s proposal of Richard Proctor that they were formed by collisions . This view gained support in 1892 from the experimentation of geologist Grove Karl Gilbert , and from comparative studies from 1920 to the 1940s , leading to the development of lunar stratigraphy , which by the 1950s was becoming a new and growing branch of astrogeology .",
  "Liver AVMs may be suspected because of abnormal liver function tests in the blood , because the symptoms of heart failure develop , or because of jaundice or other symptoms of liver dysfunction .

If necessary , contrast @-@ enhanced CT may be used to further characterize AVMs . It is extremely common to find incidental nodules on liver scans , most commonly due to focal nodular hyperplasia ( FNH ) , as these are a hundredfold times more common in HHT compared to the general population .

  "A film can become the object of a cult following within a particular region or culture if it has unusual significance . For example , Norman Wisdom 's films , friendly to Marxist interpretation , amassed a cult following in Albania , as they were among the few Western films allowed by the country 's Communist rulers . The Wizard of Oz ( 1939 ) and its star , Judy Garland , hold special significance to American and British gay culture , although it is a widely viewed and historically important film in greater American culture . Similarly , James Dean and his brief film career have become icons of alienated youth . Cult films can have such niche appeal that they are only popular within certain subcultures , such as Reefer Madness ( 1936 ) and Hemp for Victory ( 1942 ) among stoner subculture . Beach party musicals , popular among American surfers , failed to find an equivalent audience when imported to the United Kingdom . When films target subcultures like this , they may seem unintelligible without the proper cultural capital . Films which appeal to teenagers may offer subcultural identities that are easily recognized and differentiate various subcultural groups . Films which appeal to stereotypical male activities , such as sports , can easily gain strong male cult followings . Sports metaphors are often used in the marketing of cult films to males , such as emphasizing the \" extreme \" nature of the film , which increases the appeal to youth subcultures fond of extreme sports .",

  "As a result of Hill 's impressive climbs in The Gunks , she was invited to climb in Europe in 1986 . The French Alpine Club invited a group of elite American climbers to climb in the Verdon Gorge , Fontainebleau , and Buoux . Hill felt an immediate affinity for French culture and climbing . She particularly enjoyed climbing on the limestone common in France because it has many pockets and edges , producing \" wildly acrobatic climbs \" with low risk . Moreover , these types of climbs are ideal for people of small stature , like Hill . She tried sport climbing in France for the first time that year . Inspired and intrigued by European climbing culture , she returned later and took part in Arco e Bardonecchia Sportroccia ' 86 , the second edition of the first international sport climbing competition , which later became the Rock Master annual event . The event was divided into two stages , one in Arco and one in Bardonecchia , Italy . She competed against other women on extremely difficult routes , gaining points for style and speed . She lost to Catherine Destivelle in a \" disputed ruling \" but won in the following year . Destivelle in her autobiography , reckons she won that year because she planned to climb fast from the beginning , as speed was decisive in case of equality , which she doubts Hill was aware of when starting the competition . In an interview , Hill has said that this first competition was \" disorienting \" because she did not understand the language , the \" format \" or the \" judging \" nor did the organizers of the competition . \" There were a lot of politics involved , a lot of nationalism and disorganization . The rules seemed to change during the event . I remember asking about the disparity between prize money for men and women . The only response I got was , ' If the women climb without their tops , then we 'll pay them the same . ' \" However , she continued with competition climbing because she found it stimulating to climb with \" other strong women \" . In one interview , Hill said that \" if there wasn 't a Catherine Destivelle or Luisa Iovane ... or whoever there , then it would be anticlimactic . \" Destivelle became Hill 's main competition in the late 1980s while Isabelle Patissier emerged to challenge her in the early 1990s .",

  "In early planning stages of Final Fantasy VII , Aerith was to be one of only three protagonists ; herself , Cloud and Barret . During a phone call to Kitase , it was suggested that at some point in the game , one of the main characters should die , and after much discussion as to whether it should be Barret or Aerith , the producers chose Aerith . Nomura stated in a 2005 Electronic Gaming Monthly interview : \" Cloud 's the main character , so you can 't really kill him . And Barrett ... [ sic ] well , that 's maybe too obvious . \" While designing Final Fantasy VII , Nomura was frustrated with the \" perennial cliché where the protagonist loves someone very much and so has to sacrifice himself and die in a dramatic fashion to express that love . \" He found this trope appeared in both films and video games from North America and Japan , and asked \" Is it right to set such an example to people ? \" Kitase concluded : \" In the real world things are very different . You just need to look around you . Nobody wants to die that way . People die of disease and accident . Death comes suddenly and there is no notion of good or bad . It leaves , not a dramatic feeling but great emptiness . When you lose someone you loved very much you feel this big empty space and think , ' If I had known this was coming I would have done things differently . ' These are the feelings I wanted to arouse in the players with Aerith 's death relatively early in the game . Feelings of reality and not Hollywood . \"",

  "Some parts of an antibody have the same functions . The arms of the Y , for example , contain the sites that can bind to antigens ( in general , identical ) and , therefore , recognize specific foreign objects . This region of the antibody is called the Fab ( fragment , antigen @-@ binding ) region . It is composed of one constant and one variable domain from each heavy and light chain of the antibody . The paratope is shaped at the amino terminal end of the antibody monomer by the variable domains from the heavy and light chains .

To be specific , variable loops of β @-@ strands , three each on the light ( VL ) and heavy ( VH ) chains are responsible for binding to the antigen .

Just a few seconds before the solo ends , the breakdown starts , in which the clean drum intro starts , then the clean guitar intro when the last notes of Kirk 's solo echo over it into the background , are heard together with Hetfield teaching a child the \" Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep \" bedtime prayer and reciting a variation of the lullaby rhyme \" Hush Little Baby \" where he is heard saying \" Hush little baby don 't say a word , and never mind that noise you heard . It 's just the beasts under your bed , in your closet , in your head \" . After building again to a chorus , the song starts to fade out while the band plays the same riffs as the buildup intro in reverse order . Lyrically , the song is about \" nightmares and all that come with them \" , according to Chris True of Allmusic . The title is a reference to the sandman , a character from Western folklore who makes children sleep .",

But , Hamilton 's early life in the Caribbean was recorded in documents which were first published in Danish in 1930 ; this evidence has caused historians since then to favor a birth year of 1755 . Hamilton listed his birth year as 1757 when he first arrived in the Thirteen Colonies . He celebrated his birthday on January 11 . In later life , he tended to give his age only in round figures . Probate papers from St. Croix in 1768 , after the death of Hamilton 's mother , list him as then 13 years old , a date that would support a birth year of 1755 . Historians have posited reasons for the different dates of birth being used : If 1755 is correct , Hamilton may have been trying to appear younger than his college classmates or perhaps wished to avoid standing out as older ; if 1757 is correct , the probate document indicating a birth year of 1755 may have been in error , or Hamilton may have been attempting to pass as 13 , in order to be more employable after his mother 's death .",

  "In 1950 , with New Worlds on a stable quarterly schedule , Nova Publications decided to launch a companion , Science Fantasy . They chose Walter Gillings as the editor ; but he was replaced by Carnell after two issues , partly because Nova could not afford to pay two editorial salaries , and partly because of \" fundamental differences of opinion \" . At the end of 1951 New Worlds went bimonthly , and by the middle of the year had reached a circulation of 18 @,@ 000 . The price had been reduced to 1 / 6 with the third issue , but with paper costs rising Nova looked for a cheaper printer . The new printer , The Carlton Press , was supposed to take over production with the May 1953 issue ( number 21 ) , but the issue was late , and had to be dated June 1953 instead . The issue was shoddily produced , which dismayed Nova 's board , and printers ' strikes caused further delays . Nova discovered that The Carlton Press was an agent with no printing facilities ; they farmed out work to other printers , but were only able to get their commissions executed when they paid off any prior debts to those printers . Issue 22 was repeatedly delayed ; proofs appeared in August , and the issue itself was promised for November . Even this late schedule was not adhered to , and Carnell finally received a copy of the print run in January 1954 . The copy was dated 1953 ( with no month ) , and since this made it useless for distribution in 1954 , Carnell refused to accept the print run . While the dispute with the printers was going on , Carnell and Maurice Goldsmith , a journalist acquaintance of Carnell 's , put together a small conference of well @-@ known science fiction authors , including Arthur C. Clarke and John Wyndham . Goldsmith covered the conference for Illustrated , a weekly magazine , and the article caught the attention of Maclaren & Sons Ltd , a technical trade publisher interested in launching a new sf magazine . Carnell turned down the offer because of his loyalty to Nova Publications , but subsequent discussions ultimately led to Maclaren taking control of Nova , with a commitment to produce New Worlds on a monthly basis and Science Fantasy on a bimonthly schedule . By January 1954 , when The Carlton Press delivered the incorrectly dated issue 22 , the acquisition by Maclaren was complete , and Maclaren 's legal department was helpful in resolving the dispute . The printing press who had actually printed the issue were not paid by The Carlton Press , so an injunction was obtained that sequestered the issues to avoid them being sold to recover the printing costs . Carnell retained the copy he had been sent in January , and it is thought that this is the only copy that exists of The Carlton Press 's version of this issue , as the remainder of the printing run was destroyed at the conclusion of the court case . The cover painting , by Gerard Quinn , was subsequently used on issue 13 of Science Fantasy , and all the stories and editorial material eventually appeared in later issues of New Worlds over the next year .",

  "At 1200 UTC on June 5 , the disturbance developed a broad , low @-@ level circulation , and was classified as Tropical Storm Allison , the first storm of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season . Some intensification was projected , though it was expected to be hindered by cool offshore sea surface temperatures . Due to the cold @-@ core nature of the center , Allison initially contained subtropical characteristics . Despite this , the storm quickly strengthened to attain peak sustained winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , with tropical storm @-@ force winds extending up to 230 miles ( 370 km ) east of the center , and a minimum central pressure of 1000 mbar . The storm initially moved very little , and the presence of several small vortices from within the deep convection caused difficulty in determining the exact center location . Later in the day , several different track forecasts arose . One scenario had the cyclone tracking westward into Mexico . Another projected the storm moving east towards southern Louisiana . At the time , it was noted that little rain or wind persisted near the center , but rather to the north and east . Under the steering currents of a subtropical ridge that extended in an east – west orientation across the southeast United States , Allison weakened while nearing the Texas coastline , and struck near Freeport , Texas with 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) winds . Inland , the storm rapidly weakened , and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on June 6 . Shortly after being downgraded to a tropical depression , surface observations showed an elongated circulation with a poorly defined center , which had reformed closer to the deep convection .",

  "Italian classical music grew gradually more experimental and progressive into the mid @-@ 20th century , while popular tastes have tended to stick with well established composers and compositions of the past . The 2004 @-@ 2005 program at the Teatro San Carlo in Naples is typical of modern Italy : of the eight operas represented , the most recent was Puccini . In symphonic music , of the 26 composers whose music was played , 21 of them were from the 19th century or earlier , composers who use the melodies and harmonies typical of the Romantic era . This focus is common to other European traditions , and is known as postmodernism , a school of thought that draws on earlier harmonic and melodic concepts that pre @-@ date the conceptions of atonality and dissonance .

  "In England , Henry initially relied on his father 's former advisers whom he brought with him from Normandy , and on some of Henry I 's remaining officials , reinforced with some of Stephen 's senior nobility who made their peace with Henry in 1153 . During his reign Henry , like his grandfather , increasingly promoted \" new men \" , minor nobles without independent wealth and lands , to positions of authority in England . By the 1180s this new class of royal administrators was predominant in England , supported by various illegitimate members of Henry 's family . In Normandy , the links between the two halves of the Anglo @-@ Norman nobility had weakened during the first half of the 12th century , and continued to do so under Henry . Henry drew his close advisers from the ranks of the Norman bishops and , as in England , recruited many \" new men \" as Norman administrators : few of the larger landowners in Normandy benefited from the king 's patronage . Henry frequently intervened with the Norman nobility through arranged marriages or the treatment of inheritances , either using his authority as duke or his influence as king of England over their lands there : Henry 's rule was a harsh one . Across the rest of France , local administration was less developed : Anjou was governed through a combination of officials called prévôts and seneschals based along the Loire and in western Touraine , but Henry had few officials elsewhere in the region . In Aquitaine , ducal authority remained very limited , despite increasing significantly during Henry 's reign , largely due to Richard 's efforts in the late 1170s .",

  "Brownlee remained intimately involved in the grain industry even outside the UGG , in part through his position on the Canadian Federation of Agriculture executive . In this capacity , he found himself in the middle of a controversy over the British Wheat Agreement ( BWA ) . The BWA was an agreement to sell wheat to British clients at a fixed price over a four @-@ year period . The price was to be adjusted during the following two years , \" having regard to \" world wheat prices . During the first four years , world wheat prices were continually above the price stipulated in the agreement , breeding resentment towards the British , especially since they sold much of this fixed price wheat for a large profit in European markets . This was exacerbated when the British refused to adjust the price upwards for the last two years , on the grounds that there was nothing in the agreement to compel them to do so . The result was considerable ill will and a loss by grain farmers of an estimated $ 350 million . The federal government , which had negotiated the agreement , offered to supplement the British payments by $ 65 million , a sum large enough to raise the ire of eastern Canadians but too small to placate western farmers . Brownlee , who had opposed the agreement , authorized a purchase of advertising across the country pointing out that the government fixed the domestic price of wheat at $ 0 @.@ 77 per bushel while the world price reached as high as $ 2 @.@ 18 . In Brownlee 's view , the $ 65 million payment by the government paled in comparison to the benefit to consumers of the federal policy . Subsequent international agreements , for which Brownlee acted as an advisor to the Canadian delegation , resulted in more favourable terms for farmers . Brownlee 's continued status as one of the grain industry 's leading figures was also exhibited by his involvement in government relations . He appeared before the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture to oppose a system of allocating box cars to each grain elevator by formula , favouring instead a system whereby the Canadian Wheat Board retained the flexibility to assign them as it saw fit . In his September 1960 submission to the Royal Commission on Transportation , In Defense of the Crow 's Nest Pass Rates , he rejected the railways ' calls to deregulate the rates they charged for the shipment of grain .",

  "Place responses in rats and mice have been studied in hundreds of experiments over four decades , yielding a large quantity of information .

These constitute the great majority of neurons in the densely packed hippocampal layers . Inhibitory interneurons , which make up most of the remaining cell population , frequently show significant place @-@ related variations in firing rate that are much weaker than those displayed by pyramidal or granule cells . There is little if any spatial topography in the representation ; in general , cells lying next to each other in the hippocampus have uncorrelated spatial firing patterns . Place cells are typically almost silent when a rat is moving around outside the place field but reach sustained rates as high as 40 Hertz when the rat is near the center .

The size of place fields varies in a gradient along the length of the hippocampus , with cells at the dorsal end showing the smallest fields , cells near the center showing larger fields , and cells at the ventral tip fields that cover the entire environment .

  "The lantern as a source of illumination in art was widely used by Baroque artists , and perfected by Caravaggio . Traditionally a dramatic light source and the resultant chiaroscuro were used as metaphors for the presence of God . Illumination by torch or candlelight took on religious connotations ; but in The Third of May the lantern manifests no such miracle . Rather , it affords light only so that the firing squad may complete its grim work , and provides a stark illumination so that the viewer may bear witness to wanton violence . The traditional role of light in art as a conduit for the spiritual has been subverted .",

  "Systematic botany is part of systematic biology , which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships , particularly as determined by their evolutionary history . It involves , or is related to , biological classification , scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics . Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species . Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy . Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus , who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics . These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics . While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms , molecular phylogenetics , which uses DNA sequences as data , has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so . The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy . It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature . The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae , fungi , and plants ( ICN ) and administered by the International Botanical Congress .",

  "Bank Markazi v.

The plaintiffs in the trial court , respondents in the Supreme Court , were several parties who had obtained judgments against Iran for its role in supporting state @-@ sponsored terrorism , particularly the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and 1996 Khobar Towers bombing , and sought execution against a bank account in New York held , through European intermediaries , on behalf of Bank Markazi , the state @-@ owned Central Bank of Iran .

Bank Markazi raised several defenses against the execution against the account , including that the account was not an asset of the bank , but rather an asset of its European intermediary , under both New York state property law and § 201 ( a ) of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act . In response to concerns that existing laws were insufficient for the account to be used to settle the judgments , Congress included a section within a 2012 bill , codified after enactment as 22 U.S.C. § 8772 , that identified the pending lawsuit by docket number , applied only to the assets in the identified case , and essentially abrogated every legal basis available to Bank Markazi to prevent the plaintiffs from executing their claims against the account . Bank Markazi then argued that § 8772 was an unconstitutional breach of the separation of power between the legislative and judicial branches of government , because it effectively directed a particular result in a single case without changing the generally applicable law . The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York and , on appeal , the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit both upheld the constitutionality of § 8772 and cleared the way for the plaintiffs to execute their judgments against the account , which held about $ 1 @.@ 75 billion in cash .",

  "At the end of 1946 , Renault abandoned the production of heavy trucks in view of its financial troubles , and the company lost the position of France 's market leader which it had before World War II . However , the rapid development and production concentration on that sector made Renault to seek ways to enter into the market . In 1950 , the Renault 's technical chief , Fernand Picard , elaborated a plan to launch a limited range of trucks and buses with a single 105 CV engine , taking advantage of the economies of scale , which proved unsuccessful . In 1953 , the strategy was changed and Renault decided to acquire rival manufacturers , starting with Somua and Latil . The company Saviem was formed in October 1955 by the merger of Renault 's trucks and buses manufacturing operations with Somua and Latil and both Schneider ( owner of Somua ) and the Blum family ( owner of Latil ) had stakes in the new company . Initially , the Saviem name was added besides the existing badges of the three forming companies but , from 1957 onwards , Saviem @-@ LRS appeared as marque 's name on the company 's products ( the acronym representing the former marques Latil , Renault and Somua ) , which was simplified to Saviem in 1960 .

The early range of the company consisted of small commercial vehicles derived of Renault 's existing models ( Goélette and Galion ) , new medium and heavy trucks with Alfa Romeo engines and Chausson support for the coach / bus production .

However , in 1987 , nearly complete fossils of Acanthostega from about 363 Ma showed that this Late Devonian transitional animal had legs and both lungs and gills , but could never have survived on land : its limbs and its wrist and ankle joints were too weak to bear its weight ; its ribs were too short to prevent its lungs from being squeezed flat by its weight ; its fish @-@ like tail fin would have been damaged by dragging on the ground .

  "The urethra and vagina of the female spotted hyena exit through the clitoris , allowing the females to urinate , copulate and give birth through this organ . This trait makes mating more laborious for the male than in other mammals , and also makes attempts to sexually coerce ( physically force sexual activity on ) females futile . Joan Roughgarden , an ecologist and evolutionary biologist , said that because the hyena 's clitoris is higher on the belly than the vagina in most mammals , the male hyena \" must slide his rear under the female when mating so that his penis lines up with [ her clitoris ] \" . In an action similar to pushing up a shirtsleeve , the \" female retracts the [ pseudo @-@ penis ] on itself , and creates an opening into which the male inserts his own penis \" . The male must practice this act , which can take a couple of months to successfully perform . Female spotted hyenas exposed to larger doses of androgen have significantly damaged ovaries , making it difficult to conceive . After giving birth , the pseudo @-@ penis is stretched and loses much of its original aspects ; it becomes a slack @-@ walled and reduced prepuce with an enlarged orifice with split lips . Approximately 15 % of the females die during their first time giving birth , and over 60 % of their species ' firstborn young die .",
  "Banded archerfish have mouths adapted to spit jets of water over distance , usually to knock prey into the water . The banded archerfish shoots the jet of water by raising its tongue against the roof of its mouth , forming a tube . The opercula then close quickly , pressurizing water along the tube . Most archerfish are able to spit at a range of 150 centimetres ( 59 in ) , though some larger specimens may be capable of ranges of up to 2 to 3 metres ( 6 ft 7 in to 9 ft 10 in ) . When a prey is shot down , the banded archerfish begins to move towards the place where it will land within 100 milliseconds and can reach it within 50 ms of its hitting the water .",

  "A technical device much used by Mahler is that of \" progressive tonality \" , which Deryck Cooke describes as \" the procedure of resolving a symphonic conflict in a different key from that in which it was stated \" , and which is often used \" to symbolise the gradual ascendancy of a certain value by progress from one key to another over the whole course of a symphony \" . This technique was also used by Mahler 's Danish contemporary Carl Nielsen . Mahler first employed the device in an early song , Erinnerung ( \" Memory \" ) , and thereafter used it freely in his symphonies . For example , the predominant key of the First Symphony is D major ; at the beginning of the Finale , the \" conflict \" movement , the key switches to F minor , and only after a lengthy battle gets back to D , near the end . The Second Symphony begins in C minor and ends in E flat . The movements of the Fifth Symphony progress successively from C @-@ sharp minor to A minor , then D major , F major and finally to D major . The Sixth Symphony , unusually for Mahler , begins and ends in the same key , A minor , signifying that in this case the conflict is unresolved .",

  "Giraffes were probably common targets for hunters throughout Africa . Different parts of their bodies were used for different purposes . Their meat was used for food .

The smoke from burning giraffe skins was used by the medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds .

  "Crawley began to develop slowly from the 13th century , when it was granted a royal charter for a market .

The parish had an unusual shape : very narrow , long from north to south , and gradually widening to the north until it met the county boundary with Surrey . This directed development northwards along the High Street , part of the ancient London to Brighton road which had provided the impetus for development to begin . The road was partly turnpiked after an Act of Parliament in 1696 , and became fully turnpiked in 1770 .

The new president , Johnson , sought the rapid restoration of the Southern states during the months between his accession and the meeting of Congress in December 1865 ; Garfield hesitantly supported this policy as an experiment .

  "The practice of birth control was common throughout the U.S. prior to 1914 , when the movement to legalize contraception began . Longstanding techniques included the rhythm method , withdrawal , diaphragms , contraceptive sponges , condoms , prolonged breastfeeding , and spermicides . Use of contraceptives increased throughout the nineteenth century , contributing to a 50 percent drop in the fertility rate in the United States between 1800 and 1900 , particularly in urban regions .

  "The 1547 Injunctions against images were a more tightly drawn version of those of 1538 , but they were more fiercely enforced , at first informally , and then by instruction . All images in churches were to be dismantled . Stained glass , shrines and statues were defaced or destroyed . Roods , and often their lofts and screens , were cut down and bells were taken down . Vestments were prohibited and either burned or sold . Chalices were melted down or sold . The requirement of the clergy to be celibate was lifted . Processions were banned and ashes and palms were prohibited . Chantries ( endowments to provide masses for the dead ) were abolished completely . How well this was received is disputed . Modern historian A.G.

The evidence is often ambiguous . In 1549 Cranmer introduced a Book of Common Prayer in English , which while to all appearances kept the structure of the Mass , altered the theology so that the holy gifts of consecrated bread and wine were not offered to God as a sacrifice . In 1550 stone altars were replaced by wooden communion tables , a very public break with the past , as it changed the look and focus of church interiors .",

In the next few months , Napoleon marched against the advancing Russian armies through Poland and was involved in the bloody stalemate at the Battle of Eylau in February 1807 . After a period of rest and consolidation on both sides , the war restarted in June with an initial struggle at Heilsberg that proved indecisive . On 14 June , however , Napoleon finally obtained an overwhelming victory over the Russians at the Battle of Friedland , wiping out the majority of the Russian army in a very bloody struggle . The scale of their defeat convinced the Russians to make peace with the French . On 19 June , Czar Alexander sent an envoy to seek an armistice with Napoleon . The latter assured the envoy that the Vistula River represented the natural borders between French and Russian influence in Europe . On that basis , the two emperors began peace negotiations at the town of Tilsit after meeting on an iconic raft on the River Niemen . The very first thing Alexander said to Napoleon was probably well @-@ calibrated : \" I hate the English as much as you do . \"",

  "The original version of the plan proposed to divert water from the Trinity River in northern California to reduce Southern California 's dependence on the Colorado , allowing more water to be pumped , by exchange , to central Arizona .

  "The golden ratio , roughly equal to 1 @.@ 618 , was known to Euclid . The golden ratio has persistently been claimed in modern times to have been used in art and architecture by the ancients in Egypt , Greece and elsewhere , without reliable evidence .

The 5th century BCE temple , the Parthenon in Athens , has been claimed to use the golden ratio in its façade and floor plan , but these claims too are disproved by measurement . The Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia has similarly been claimed to use the golden ratio in its design , but the ratio does not appear in the original parts of the mosque .

  "Spotted hyenas usually hunt wildebeest either singly , or in groups of two or three . They catch adult wildebeest usually after 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) chases at speeds of up to 60 km / h ( 37 mi / h ) . Chases are usually initiated by one hyena and , with the exception of cows with calves , there is little active defence from the wildebeest herd . Wildebeest will sometimes attempt to escape hyenas by taking to water although , in such cases , the hyenas almost invariably catch them . Zebras require different hunting methods to those used for wildebeest , due to their habit of running in tight groups and aggressive defence from stallions . Typical zebra hunting groups consist of 10 – 25 hyenas , though there is one record of a hyena killing an adult zebra unaided . During a chase , zebras typically move in tight bunches , with the hyenas pursuing behind in a crescent formation . Chases are usually relatively slow , with an average speed of 15 – 30 km / h . A stallion will attempt to place himself between the hyenas and the herd , though once a zebra falls behind the protective formation it is immediately set upon , usually after a chase of 3 km ( 1 @.@ 9 mi ) . Though hyenas may harass the stallion , they usually only concentrate on the herd and attempt to dodge the stallion 's assaults . Unlike stallions , mares typically only react aggressively to hyenas when their foals are threatened . Unlike wildebeest , zebras rarely take to water when escaping hyenas . When hunting Thomson 's gazelles , spotted hyenas usually operate alone , and prey primarily on young fawns . Chases against both adult and young gazelles can cover distances of 5 km ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) with speeds of 60 km / h ( 37 mi / h ) . Female gazelles do not defend their fawns , though they may attempt to distract hyenas by feigning weakness .",

  "The critic Sacheverell Sitwell compared Offenbach 's lyrical and comic gifts to those of Mozart and Rossini . Friedrich Nietzsche called Offenbach both an \" artistic genius \" and a \" clown \" , but wrote that \" nearly every one \" of Offenbach 's works achieves half a dozen \" moments of wanton perfection \" . Émile Zola commented on Offenbach and his work in a novel ( Nana ) and an essay , \" La féerie et l 'opérette IV / V \" . While granting that Offenbach 's best operettas are full of grace , charm and wit , Zola blames Offenbach for what others have made out of the genre . Zola calls operetta a \" public enemy \" and a \" monstrous beast \" . While some critics saw the satire in Offenbach 's works as a social protest , an attack against the establishment , Zola saw the works as a homage to the social system in the Second Empire .",

  "Using John Wisdom 's parable of the invisible gardener , Flew attempted to demonstrate that religious language is unfalsifiable . The parable tells the story of two people who discover a garden on a deserted island ; one believes it is tended to by a gardener , the other believes that it formed naturally , without the existence of a gardener . The two watch out for the gardener but never find him ; the non @-@ believer consequently maintains that there is no gardener , whereas the believer rationalises the non @-@ appearance by suggesting that the gardener is invisible and cannot be detected . Flew contended that if the believer 's interpretation is accepted , nothing is left of the original gardener . He argued that religious believers tend to adopt counterpart rationalisations in response to any apparent challenge to their beliefs from empirical evidence ; and these beliefs consequently suffer a \" death by a thousand qualifications \" as they are qualified and modified so much that they end up asserting nothing meaningful . Flew applied his principles to religious claims such as God 's love for humans , arguing that if they are meaningful assertions they would deny a certain state of affairs . He argued that when faced with evidence against the existence of a loving God , such as the terminal illness of a child , theists will qualify their claims to allow for such evidence ; for example they may suggest that God 's love is different from human love . Such qualifications , Flew argued , make the original proposition meaningless ; he questioned what God 's love actually promises and what it guarantees against , and proposed that God 's qualified love promises nothing and becomes worthless .",

  "Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC . The Stoics taught that destructive emotions resulted from errors in judgment , of the active relationship between cosmic determinism and human freedom , and the belief that it is virtuous to maintain a will ( called prohairesis ) that is in accord with nature . Because of this , the Stoics presented their philosophy as a way of life ( lex devina ) , and they thought that the best indication of an individual 's philosophy was not what a person said but how that person behaved . To live a good life , one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they taught that everything was rooted in nature .",

  "A \" mulligan \" rule was introduced into the game , first informally in casual play and then in the official game rules . The modern \" Paris mulligan \" allows players to shuffle an unsatisfactory opening hand back into the deck at the start of the game , draw a new hand with one fewer card , and repeat until satisfied , after which any player who has taken a mulligan may look at the top card of his or her deck and either return it or put it at the bottom of the deck . In multiplayer , a player may take one mulligan without penalty , while subsequent mulligans will still cost one card ( a rule known as \" Partial Paris mulligan \" ) . The original mulligan allowed a player a single redraw of seven new cards if that player 's initial hand contained seven or zero lands .

The Royal Commission comes at a time of economic contraction for South Australia , which is suffering from job losses in mining and manufacturing sectors . Immediately following the announcement of the Royal Commission , emeritus Prof. Ian Lowe suggested that the current inquiry risks retreading old ground already covered by several previous public inquiries and proposals for nuclear industrialisation .

  "The Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844 had been written between April and August 1844 . Soon , though , Marx recognised that the Manuscripts had been influenced by some inconsistent ideas of Ludwig Feuerbach . Accordingly , Marx recognised the need to break with Feuerbach 's philosophy in favour of historical materialism . Thus , a year later , in April 1845 , after moving from Paris to Brussels , Marx wrote his eleven \" Theses on Feuerbach , \" The \" Theses on Feuerbach \" are best known for Thesis 11 , which states that \" philosophers have only interpreted the world in various ways , the point is to change it \" . This work contains Marx 's criticism of materialism ( for being contemplative ) , idealism ( for reducing practice to theory ) overall , criticising philosophy for putting abstract reality above the physical world . It thus introduced the first glimpse at Marx 's historical materialism , an argument that the world is changed not by ideas but by actual , physical , material activity and practice . In 1845 , after receiving a request from the Prussian king , the French government shut down Vorwärts ! , with the interior minister , François Guizot , expelling Marx from France . At this point , Marx moved from Paris to Brussels , where Marx hoped to , once again , continue his study of capitalism and political economy .",

  "The fighting represented a watershed in the campaign for the Australians , and while they had deployed outside Phuoc Tuy Province previously , they now faced regular North Vietnamese formations and Viet Cong Main Force units operating in battalion and regimental strength , rather than southern Viet Cong guerrillas . With 1 ATF deploying astride the communist lines of communication the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong had been forced to respond , resulting in a set @-@ piece battle far removed from the counter @-@ insurgency doctrine the Australians normally espoused . Yet while the battle ended in victory for 1 ATF , they had come close to suffering defeat at the hands of the North Vietnamese . Inexperienced at large air @-@ mobile operations , poor reconnaissance and inadequate operational planning had caused delays and confusion during the fly @-@ in to FSB Coral , leaving the Australian force exposed to attack on the first night . The North Vietnamese had fought in greater numbers , with heavier firepower and greater intensity than previously experienced by the Australians in Vietnam , forcing them to refine their tactics . Later , the Australian use of platoon patrols to search an area and conduct ambushes was challenged by the constant movement of North Vietnamese forces operating in superior strength , which threatened to quickly overwhelm an isolated patrol .",

  "As the USMC wanted a substantially improved Harrier without the development of a new engine , the plan for Harrier II development was authorized by the United States Department of Defense ( DoD ) in 1976 . The United States Navy ( USN ) , which had traditionally procured military aircraft for the USMC , insisted that the new design be verified with flight testing . McDonnell Douglas modified two AV @-@ 8As with new wings , revised intakes , redesigned exhaust nozzles , and other aerodynamic changes ; the modified forward fuselage and cockpit found on all subsequent aircraft were not incorporated on these prototypes . Designated YAV @-@ 8B , the first converted aircraft flew on 9 November 1978 , at the hands of Charles Plummer . The aircraft performed three vertical take @-@ offs and hovered for seven minutes at Lambert – St. Louis International Airport . The second aircraft followed on 19 February 1979 , but crashed that November due to engine flameout ; the pilot ejected safely . Flight testing of these modified AV @-@ 8s continued into 1979 . The results showed greater than expected drag , hampering the aircraft 's maximum speed . Further refinements to the aerodynamic profile yielded little improvement . Positive test results in other areas , including payload , range , and V / STOL performance , led to the award of a development contract in 1979 . The contract stipulated a procurement of 12 aircraft initially , followed by a further 324 .",

Easley 's declining play , which was partially blamed on his work during the strike , and the blossoming of Easley 's backup Paul Moyer , had made Easley expendable . On April 22 , 1988 , the Seahawks traded Easley to the Phoenix Cardinals for quarterback Kelly Stouffer . During the mandatory team physical , Easley was diagnosed with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome , a severe kidney disease that voided the trade .

  "At the prenatal and neonatal stages of life , the presence of antibodies is provided by passive immunization from the mother . Early endogenous antibody production varies for different kinds of antibodies , and usually appear within the first years of life . Since antibodies exist freely in the bloodstream , they are said to be part of the humoral immune system . Circulating antibodies are produced by clonal B cells that specifically respond to only one antigen ( an example is a virus capsid protein fragment ) . Antibodies contribute to immunity in three ways : They prevent pathogens from entering or damaging cells by binding to them ; they stimulate removal of pathogens by macrophages and other cells by coating the pathogen ; and they trigger destruction of pathogens by stimulating other immune responses such as the complement pathway . Antibodies will also trigger vasoactive amine degranulation to contribute to immunity against certain types of antigens ( helminths , allergens ) .",

  "A bone unique to pterosaurs , known as the pteroid , connected to the wrist and helped to support a forward membrane ( the propatagium ) between the wrist and shoulder . Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb suggests that this forward membrane may have been more extensive than the simple pteroid @-@ to @-@ shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations . The position of the pteroid bone itself has been controversial . Some scientists , notably Matthew Wilkinson , have argued that the pteroid pointed forward , extending the forward membrane . This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett , who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed forward , but rather inward toward the body as traditionally thought . Peters ( 2009 ) proposed that the pteroid articulated with the ‘ saddle ' of the radiale ( proximal syncarpal ) and both the pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia . This view of the articulation of the pteroid has since been supported by specimens of Changchengopterus pani and Darwinopterus linglongtaensis , both of which show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal .",

  "Great changes in the tactical use of cavalry were a marked feature of World War I , as improved weaponry rendered frontal charges ineffective . Although cavalry was used with good effect in Palestine , at the Third Battle of Gaza and Battle of Megiddo , generally the mode of warfare changed . Tanks were beginning to take over the role of shock combat . The use of trench warfare , barbed wire and machine guns rendered traditional cavalry almost obsolete . Following the war , the armies of the world powers initiated a process of mechanization in earnest , and most cavalry regiments were either converted to mechanized units or disbanded . Historian G.J. Meyer writes that \" the Great War brought the end of cavalry \" . From the Middle Ages into the 20th century , cavalry had dominated battlefields , but from as early as the American Civil War , their value in war was declining as artillery became more powerful , reducing the effectiveness of shock charges . The Western Front in World War I showed that cavalry was almost useless against modern weaponry , and it also reinforced that they were difficult to transport and supply . British cavalry officers , far more than their continental European counterparts , persisted in using and maintaining cavalry , believing that mounted troops would be useful for exploiting infantry breakthroughs , and under the right circumstances would be able to face machine guns . Neither of these beliefs proved correct .",
