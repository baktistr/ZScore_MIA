  "Several historians credit the Reform Act 1832 with launching modern democracy in Britain . G. M. Trevelyan hails 1832 as the watershed moment at which \" ' the sovereignty of the people ' had been established in fact , if not in law \" . Sir Erskine May notes that \" [ the ] reformed Parliament was , unquestionably , more liberal and progressive in its policy than the Parliaments of old ; more vigorous and active ; more susceptible to the influence of public opinion ; and more secure in the confidence of the people \" , but admitted that \" grave defects still remained to be considered \" . Other historians have taken a far less laudatory view , arguing that genuine democracy began to arise only with the Second Reform Act in 1867 , or perhaps even later . Norman Gash states that \" it would be wrong to assume that the political scene in the succeeding generation differed essentially from that of the preceding one \" . E. A. Smith proposes , in a similar vein , that \" when the dust had settled , the political landscape looked much as it had done before .",

  "Ponies often exhibit thicker manes , tails , and overall coat . They also have proportionally shorter legs , wider barrels , heavier bone , shorter and thicker necks , and short heads with broad foreheads . They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers . Small size , by itself , is not an exclusive determinant . For example , the Shetland pony which averages 10 hands ( 40 inches , 102 cm ) , is considered a pony . Conversely , breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses , which can be no taller than 30 inches ( 76 cm ) , are classified by their registries as very small horses , not ponies .",

  "In an interview about the film on his website , Anderson discussed problems he encountered in naming his film Fuck instead of a censored version of the word . Anderson always wanted to call it Fuck , because it succinctly described the film 's contents . There were inherent problems with this approach , including an inability to advertise the true title in mainstream media such as The New York Times and Los Angeles Times ( they used four asterisks instead ) , although the real title might be permitted in alternative newspapers such as LA Weekly . Anderson also anticipated problems displaying the film 's title during film festivals on theatre marquees .",

Near the end of the story a demonic creature kills Bêlit and Conan seeks revenge . The creature , however , is stronger than Conan , overpowers him , and is about to kill him when Bêlit 's spirit startles it and inspires Conan to kill the beast . The game 's story follows a similar theme with A 'kanna in the role of Bêlit . Told as a campfire story , cut scenes — in the form of static artwork or animation rendered by the game engine — open and close each level with narratives from an elderly A 'kanna .",
  "In 1802 , the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike was chartered by the New York State Legislature \" for improving and making a road from the west line of the Town of Salisbury in the State of Connecticut to the Susquehanna River at or near the Town of Jericho ( now Bainbridge ) \" .

  "The main inspiration for the design — in which the forts are blasted into the mountains rather than constructed on top of them — came from Vaberget Fortress near Karlsborg Fortress . Vaberget Fortress was built in the 1890s and its southern fort was the first fort in the world that fully used the protection provided by the bedrock itself by having all of its functions embedded in the mountain . Vaberget Fortress served as a prototype for Boden Fortress and many more future fortifications in Sweden , including the late 20th century fixed army and coastal artillery batteries that gave the Swedish Fortifications Agency world renown . Preparatory work was started in 1900 and consisted of a diverse number of tasks , ranging from purchase of beds for the construction workers , construction of a new loading site for the railway , building roads to the various construction sites and clearing the land of those sites . The plan for the Fortifications at Boden ( Befästningarna vid Boden ) — which was the term used until the First World War when the present name Boden Fortress came into widespread use — was largely based on the proposal laid forward by the Fortification Committee of 1897 , with only minor modifications .",

  "The committee keeps the list of species it considers under review and , from time to time , makes changes . These are usually because species have increased in frequency and no longer meet the numerical criteria for inclusion . A species is removed if it has more than 150 records in the preceding ten years , with ten or more in at least eight of those years . Different criteria were used in a review in 2006 ( see below ) .

Once again , as Carey began \" Vision of Love \" , her \" first single ever \" , Afansieff swapped positions with Cole .

Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set @-@ list , \" Make It Happen \" , Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole , playing the bass while the latter handled the treble . After the song began , the back @-@ up began \" piling their vocals \" over Carey 's , according to author Chris Nickson , and allowed the song to attain a more \" churchy feel \" .

They wanted to produce Treehouse of Horror episodes , episodes about Sideshow Bob , Itchy & Scratchy and several \" format @-@ bending \" episodes such as \" 22 Short Films About Springfield \" , for which Weinstein wrote the scene featuring Comic Book Guy and Milhouse Van Houten . They aimed for \" at least two episodes per season that ' pushed the envelope ' , [ and ] expanded the definition of what an episode could be . \" This was a style they employed for both seasons they produced . Season eight featured several episodes in which focus was given to secondary characters and in which new issues were explored , such as divorce . Their preferred choice of guest stars were those with unique and interesting voices , and several of their guest stars were \" old grizzled men with distinctive voices \" such as R. Lee Ermey , Donald Sutherland , Kirk Douglas and Lawrence Tierney .

Season three was their basis for Homer : \" We liked Homer the way he was in the second and third seasons . That was what we consciously used as our model .

Due to the large number of sets , the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions . The crew made several ceilings from bleached muslin tiles .

The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters . The key light was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights . Stern used stronger skypans — more intense than is commonly used for key lighting — to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects , as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows .",

The \" change of position \" defence is where the defendant has received property and giving it back would change his personal circumstances .

Such a defence is closely linked with unjust enrichment , and has limitations .

The defence is also not available to people who act illegally , as in Barros Mattos v MacDaniels Ltd .

  "In the time after myth , most gods were said to be either in the sky or invisibly present within the world . Temples were their main means of contact with humanity . Each day , it was believed , the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples , their homes in the human world . There they inhabited the cult images , the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals . This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth . As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities , the god in a city 's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region . Deities ' spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over . Many gods had more than one cult center , and their local ties changed over time . They could establish themselves in new cities , or their range of influence could contract . Therefore , a given deity 's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin . The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity . When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom ( c . 2055 – 1650 BC ) , they elevated Thebes ' patron gods — first the war god Montu and then Amun — to national prominence .",

  "Aristotle ( 384 – 322 BC ) and Pliny ( 23 – 79 AD ) both wrote about the legend of a contest among the birds to see who should be their king , the title to be awarded to the one that could fly highest . Initially , it looked as though the eagle would win easily , but as he began to tire , a small bird that had hidden under the eagle 's tail feathers emerged to fly even higher and claimed the title . Following from this legend , in much European folklore the wren has been described as the \" king of the birds \" or as a flame bearer . However , these terms were also applied to the Regulus species , the fiery crowns of the goldcrest and firecrest making them more likely to be the original bearers of these titles , and , because of the legend 's reference to the \" smallest of birds \" becoming king , the title was probably transferred to the equally tiny wren . The confusion was probably compounded by the similarity and consequent interchangeability of the Greek words for the wren ( βασιλεύς basileus , \" king \" ) and the crests ( βασιλισκος basiliskos , \" kinglet \" ) . In English , the association between the goldcrest and Eurasian wren may have been reinforced by the kinglet 's old name of \" gold @-@ crested wren \" .",

  "To supply the electrical power necessary for arc welding processes , a variety of different power supplies can be used . The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies . In arc welding , the length of the arc is directly related to the voltage , and the amount of heat input is related to the current . Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding , because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies . This is important because in manual welding , it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady , and as a result , the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate . Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current , and as a result , are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal arc welding , flux cored arc welding , and submerged arc welding . In these processes , arc length is kept constant , since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current . For example , if the wire and the base material get too close , the current will rapidly increase , which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt , returning it to its original separation distance .",

The fire had been deliberately set on the roof , and Gallini offered a reward of £ 300 for capture of the culprit . With the theatre destroyed , each group laid their own plans for a replacement . Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby Little Theatre , and he entered into a partnership with R. B. O 'Reilly to obtain land in Leicester Fields for a new building , which too would require a licence . The two quarrelled , and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other . The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields , but O 'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the Oxford Street Pantheon . This too , would burn to the ground in 1792 . Meanwhile , Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King 's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh , but this was now promised to O 'Reilly . A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter . The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees , but at this point O 'Reilly 's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably , and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors .",

In 1432 he acquired the earldoms of March and Ulster on the death of his maternal uncle Edmund Mortimer , Earl of March , who had died campaigning with Henry V in France , and the earldom of Cambridge which had belonged to his father . Being descended from Edward III in both the maternal and the paternal line gave Richard a significant claim to the throne if the Lancastrian line should fail , and by cognatic primogeniture arguably a superior claim . He emphasised the point by being the first to assume the Plantagenet surname in 1448 . Having inherited the March and Ulster titles , he became the wealthiest and most powerful noble in England , second only to the king himself .

  "In the spring of 1800 , Napoleon and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps into Italy , aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when Napoleon was still in Egypt . After a difficult crossing over the Alps , the French army entered the plains of Northern Italy virtually unopposed . While one French army approached from the north , the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa , which was besieged by a substantial force . The fierce resistance of this French army , under André Masséna , gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference . After spending several days looking for each other , the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on 14 June . General Melas had a numerical advantage , fielding about 30 @,@ 000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24 @,@ 000 French troops . The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back . Melas concluded that he 'd won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm , leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French . However , the French lines never broke during their tactical retreat ; Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight . Late in the afternoon , a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and dramatically reversed the tide of the battle . A series of artillery barrages and fortunate cavalry charges managed to decimate the Austrian army , which fled chaotically over the Bormida River back to Alessandria , leaving behind 14 @,@ 000 casualties . The following day , the Austrian army agreed to abandon Northern Italy once more with the Convention of Alessandria , which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region .",
  "In 2012 , the population of Madagascar was estimated at just over 22 million , 90 % of whom live on less than $ 2 per day . Malagasy and French are both official languages of the state .

  "The mirror neuron system consists of a class of neurons that was first studied in the 1990s in macaque monkeys . Studies have found sets of neurons that fire when these monkeys perform simple tasks and also when the monkeys view others performing the same simple tasks .

  "MWC 922 is a star surrounded by a planetary nebula . Dubbed the Red Square Nebula due to its similarities to the Red Rectangle Nebula , the planetary nebula appears to be a nearly perfect square with a dark band around the equatorial regions . The nebula contains concentric rings , which are similar to those seen in the supernova SN 1987A . MWC 922 itself is an FS Canis Majoris variable , meaning that it is a Be star containing exceptionally bright hydrogen emission lines as well as select forbidden lines , likely due to the presence of a close binary . East of Xi Serpentis is another planetary nebula , Abell 41 , containing the binary star MT Serpentis at its center . The nebula appears to have a bipolar structure , and the axis of symmetry of the nebula has been found to be within 5 ° of the line perpendicular to the orbital plane of the stars , strengthening the link between binary stars and bipolar planetary nebulae . On the other end of the stellar age spectrum is L483 , a dark nebula which contains the protostar IRAS 18418 @-@ 0440 . Although classified as a class 0 protostar , it has some unusual features for such an object , such as a lack of high @-@ velocity stellar winds , and it has been proposed that this object is in transition between class 0 and class I.

  "The Eurasian eagle @-@ owl is a member of the genus Bubo , which may include either 22 or 25 extant species . Almost all the larger owl species in the world today are included in Bubo . Based on an extensive fossil record and a central distribution of extant species on that continent , the Bubo appears to have evolved into existence in Africa , although early radiations seem to branch from southern Asia as well . Two genera belonging to the scops owls complex , the giant scops owls ( Otus gurneyi ) found in Asia and the Ptilopsis or the white @-@ faced scops owl found in Africa , although firmly ensconced in the scops owl group , appear to share some characteristics with the eagle @-@ owls . The Strix is also related to the Bubo and is considered a \" sister complex \" , with the Pulsatrix possibly being intermediate between the two . The Eurasian eagle @-@ owl appears to represent an expansion of the Bubo genus into the Eurasian continent . A few of the other species of Bubo seem to have been derived from the Eurasian eagle @-@ owl , making it a \" paraspecies \" , or they at least share a relatively recent common ancestor .

Smaller and paler than Eurasian eagle @-@ owls , the pharaoh can also be considered a distinct species largely due to its higher pitched and more descending call and the observation that Eurasian eagle @-@ owls formerly found in Morocco ( B. b. hispanus ) apparently did not breed with the co @-@ existing pharaoh eagle @-@ owls . On the contrary , the race still found together with the pharaoh in the wild ( B. b. interpositus ) in the central Middle East has been found to interbreed in the wild with the pharaoh eagle @-@ owls , although genetical materials have indicated interpositus may itself be a distinct species from the Eurasian eagle @-@ owl as it differs from nominate subspecies eagle @-@ owls by 2 @.@ 8 % in mitochondrial DNA . The Indian eagle owl was also considered a subspecies of Eurasian eagle @-@ owl until recently , however its smaller size , distinct voice ( more clipped and high @-@ pitched than Eurasians ) and the fact that it is largely allopatric in distribution ( filing out the Indian subcontinent ) with Eurasian eagle @-@ owl races has led to it being considered a distinct species . The mitochondrial DNA of the Indian species also appears considerably distinct from the Eurasian species . The cape eagle @-@ owl ( B. capensis ) appears to represent a return of this genetic line back into the African continent , where it leads a lifestyle similar to northern eagle @-@ owls albeit far to the south . Another offshoot of the northern Bubo group is the snowy owl . It appears to have separated from other Bubo at least 4 million years ago .",

  "Furthermore , Whorf introduced the concept of the allophone , a word that describes positional phonetic variants of a single superordinate phoneme ; in doing so he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory . The term was popularized by G. L. Trager and Bernard Bloch in a 1941 paper on English phonology and went on to become part of standard usage within the American structuralist tradition . Whorf considered allophones to be another example of linguistic relativity . The principle of allophony describes how acoustically different sounds can be treated as reflections of a single phoneme in a language . This sometimes makes the different sound appear similar to native speakers of the language , even to the point that they are unable to distinguish them auditorily without special training . Whorf wrote that : \" [ allophones ] are also relativistic . Objectively , acoustically , and physiologically the allophones of [ a ] phoneme may be extremely unlike , hence the impossibility of determining what is what . You always have to keep the observer in the picture . What linguistic pattern makes like is like , and what it makes unlike is unlike \" . ( Whorf , 1940 )",

  "The university passed a statute in 1875 allowing its delegates to create examinations for women at roughly undergraduate level ; for a brief period after the turn of the twentieth century , this allowed the \" steamboat ladies \" to receive ad eundem degrees from the University of Dublin . The first four women 's colleges were established due to the activism of the Association for Promoting the Higher Education of Women ( AEW ) .

The reconstruction of 115 cities began in 1946 , and this work was conducted in line with guidelines developed by the Japanese government . The Allied occupation authorities were not involved in the urban rebuilding effort , but allowed this work to go ahead despite criticizing it as inappropriate to Japan 's status as a defeated country . Requisitions of land and buildings for use by the occupation force and a requirement that the Japanese government prioritize the construction of housing for the Allied troops interfered with reconstruction , however . In many cities rebuilding was accompanied by a process of land readjustment which sought to improve the urban layout , though the success of both such readjustment and rebuilding programs varied between locations . Overall , most of the new buildings constructed were of poor quality , and it was not until well after the war that major urban improvement projects were undertaken .",

For example , off @-@ angle shots in \" Dead in the Water \" are accompanied by repetitive and discordant notes . As well , spoken words such as \" water \" and \" die \" are followed by a lower pitch because Lennertz felt it created a \" gurgly \" water sound .

The score of \" Hell House \" , on the other hand , had a much lighter tone to coincide with the episode 's humor . For example , music for the scenes involving the \" professional \" ghost hunters used percussion instruments to slightly mimic the Mission : Impossible theme .",

  "The role of wildfire is an important one for plant and animal species diversity . Many tree species have evolved to mainly germinate after a wildfire . Regions of the park that have experienced wildfire in historical times have greater species diversity after reestablishment than those regions that have not been influenced by fire . Though the Yellowstone fires of 1988 had minimal impact on Grand Teton National Park , studies conducted before and reaffirmed after that event concluded than the suppression of natural wildfires during the middle part of the 20th century decreased plant species diversity and natural regeneration of plant communities . One study conducted 15 years before the 1988 Yellowstone National Park fires concluded that human suppression of wildfire had adversely impacted Aspen tree groves and other forest types . The majority of conifer species in Grand Teton National Park are heavily dependent on wildfire and this is particularly true of the Lodgepole Pine . Though extremely hot canopy or crown fires tend to kill Lodgepole Pine seeds , lower severity surface fires usually result in a higher post wildfire regeneration of this species . In accordance with a better understanding of the role wildfire plays in the environment , the National Park Service and other land management agencies have developed Fire Management Plans which provide a strategy for wildfire management and are expected to best enhance the natural ecosystem .",

  "\" Sisters at Heart \" received the Governors Award at the 23rd Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony in 1971 .

  "Central to Edward III 's policy was reliance on the higher nobility for purposes of war and administration . While his father had regularly been in conflict with a great portion of his peerage , Edward III successfully created a spirit of camaraderie between himself and his greatest subjects . Both Edward I and Edward II had been limited in their policy towards the nobility , allowing the creation of few new peerages during the sixty years preceding Edward III 's reign . The young king reversed this trend when , in 1337 , as a preparation for the imminent war , he created six new earls on the same day . At the same time , Edward expanded the ranks of the peerage upwards , by introducing the new title of duke for close relatives of the king . Furthermore , Edward bolstered the sense of community within this group by the creation of the Order of the Garter , probably in 1348 . A plan from 1344 to revive the Round Table of King Arthur never came to fruition , but the new order carried connotations from this legend by the circular shape of the garter . Polydore Vergil tells of how the young Joan of Kent , Countess of Salisbury – allegedly the king 's favourite at the time – accidentally dropped her garter at a ball at Calais . King Edward responded to the ensuing ridicule of the crowd by tying the garter around his own knee with the words honi soit qui mal y pense – shame on him who thinks ill of it .",

  "The Arbitration Act 1979 ( c.42 ) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that reformed arbitration law in England and Wales . Prior to 1979 , arbitration law was based on the Arbitration Act 1950 , which allowed use of the \" Case Stated \" procedure and other methods of judicial intervention , which marked English arbitration law as significantly different from that of other jurisdictions . The prior law significantly increased the cost and time required for arbitration , which made England an unpopular jurisdiction to conduct such negotiations in . As a result , while London maintained its traditional position as a centre for arbitration in insurance , admiralty and commodities trading , it failed to attract more modern forms of trade . Following pressure from industry groups , the Lord Chancellor introduced the Arbitration Bill into Parliament , having it passed hours before the dissolution of James Callaghan 's government .

  "By the 17th century the judicial philosophy had changed to allow the protection of a claimant 's enjoyment of their land , with the duty being on the party that caused the nuisance to prevent it : \" as every man is bound to look to his cattle , as to keep them out of his neighbour 's ground ; so he must keep in the filth of his house of office , that it may not flow in upon and damnify his neighbour \" . During the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution , the law of nuisance significantly changed ; rather than the previous tests a standard of care was instead expected , with different standards applying to individuals and companies . In reaching these decisions the courts \" effectively emasculated the Law of Nuisance as a useful curb on industrial pollution \" . In St Helen 's Smelting Co v Tipping , for example , several judges \" were explicit in suggesting that they were affected by the adverse effect of a more draconian view on the economic welfare of the country 's industrial cities \" . This contrasted with the previous view , which was that when liability was established for a case where the defendant 's actions had interfered with the enjoyment of land , the defendant would be liable however trivial the interference .",

  "This was originally interpreted as the foundation of the King 's Bench , with the Court of Common Pleas not coming into existence until the signing of the Magna Carta . The later theory was that Henry II 's decree created the Court of Common Pleas , not the King 's Bench , and that the King 's Bench instead split from the Common Pleas at some later time . The first records of an independent King 's Bench come from 1234 , when distinct plea rolls are found for each court . Modern academics give 1234 as the founding date for the King 's Bench as a fully independent tribunal , considering it part of the law reform which took place from 1232 to 1234 . Under Edward I , the presence of the King in the court became more and more irregular , and by 1318 the court sat independent of the monarch . Its last travels around the country were in 1414 to Leicestershire , Staffordshire and Shropshire , and a visit to Northamptonshire in 1421 . From then onwards , the King 's Bench became a fixed court rather than one that followed the King . Like the Common Pleas , the King 's Bench sat in Westminster Hall until its dissolution .",

  "The A1 is the latest in a series of routes north from London to York and beyond , and was formed in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport as part of the Great Britain road numbering scheme . The earliest documented northern routes out of London are the roads created by the Romans during the period 43 to 410 AD , which consisted of a variety of \" Iters \" on the Antonine Itinerary , a combination of which were used by the Anglo @-@ Saxons as the route from London to York , and which became known as Ermine Street . Ermine Street later became known as the Old North Road , and is used within London by the current A10 . By the 12th century , because of flooding and damage by traffic on Ermine Street , an alternative route out of London was found through Islington and Muswell Hill , and this was the origin of the Great North Road that would become the A1 . Until the 14th century the route went up what is now Hornsey Road – the A103 road , but when that became impassable a new route along Holloway Road via Highgate was created in the 14th century . The section through Highgate was bypassed in the early 19th century by the creation of a new road , Archway Road , and around the same time a turnpike road , New North Road and Canonbury Road ( the A1200 road ) , was constructed linking the start of the Old North Road around Shoreditch with the Great North Road at Highbury Corner .",

He posited that the mind is a \" blank slate \" or tabula rasa , free from innate ideas , and that because children enter the world without preconceived notions ; whatever ideas they absorb early in life will fundamentally affect their later development .

  "According to inclusive fitness theory , organisms can gain fitness not just through increasing their own reproductive output , but also that of close relatives . In evolutionary terms , individuals should help relatives when Cost < Relatedness * Benefit . The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure . In haplodiploid species , females develop from fertilized eggs and males from unfertilized eggs . Because a male is haploid ( has only one copy of each gene ) , his daughters ( which are diploid , with two copies of each gene ) share 100 % of his genes and 50 % of their mother 's . Therefore , they share 75 % of their genes with each other . This mechanism of sex determination gives rise to what W. D. Hamilton termed \" supersisters \" , more closely related to their sisters than they would be to their own offspring . Workers often do not reproduce , but they can pass on more of their genes by helping to raise their sisters ( as queens ) than they would by having their own offspring ( each of which would only have 50 % of their genes ) . This unusual situation has been proposed as an explanation of the multiple independent evolutions of eusociality ( arising at least nine separate times ) within the Hymenoptera . However , some eusocial species such as termites are not haplodiploid . Conversely , many bees are haplodiploid yet are not eusocial , and among eusocial species many queens mate with multiple males , creating half @-@ sisters that share only 25 % of their genes . Haplodiploidy is thus neither necessary nor sufficient for eusociality . But , monogamy ( queens mating singly ) is the ancestral state for all eusocial species so far investigated , so it is likely that haplodiploidy contributed to the evolution of eusociality in bees .",

  "The theta mode appears during states of active , alert behavior ( especially locomotion ) , and also during REM ( dreaming ) sleep . In the theta mode , the EEG is dominated by large regular waves with a frequency range of 6 to 9 Hertz , and the main groups of hippocampal neurons ( pyramidal cells and granule cells ) show sparse population activity , which means that in any short time interval , the great majority of cells are silent , while the small remaining fraction fire at relatively high rates , up to 50 spikes in one second for the most active of them . An active cell typically stays active for half a second to a few seconds . As the rat behaves , the active cells fall silent and new cells become active , but the overall percentage of active cells remains more or less constant . In many situations , cell activity is determined largely by the spatial location of the animal , but other behavioral variables also clearly influence it .",
  "StarClan is a group of the Clans ' deceased ancestors who give guidance to the Clans . After death , most Clan cats join StarClan . StarClan is said to be represented by Silverpelt ( the Milky Way ) , and each individual star represents the spirit of a single dead warrior . Upon joining StarClan , the cats ' spirits take the form in which they were most happy while living ( i.e. blindness and deafness can be cured ) . StarClan warriors keep watch over the Clans , usually watching the Clan they lived in while alive . They provide guidance to the Clans , often through dreams and other signs like omens . Often , this occurs when medicine cats go to the Moonstone , a large piece of quartz in an abandoned mine , which is used in the forest territory to communicate with the medicine cats ' ancestors every half @-@ moon . When the Clans move to live by a lake because humans destroy their forest , the medicine cats gather at the Moonpool , a pool used as the replacement for the Moonstone . In an author chat , Hunter said that StarClan can \" just get glimpses of \" the future , which they occasionally pass on . In addition to StarClan , there exists the Dark Forest , also known as The Place of No Stars .

Dark Forest cats eventually gain the ability to walk in dreams like StarClan . Both Dark Forest and StarClan cats eventually fade away as they are forgotten . In addition , both Dark Forest and StarClan cats fade away before they are forgotten if they are \" killed \" .",

Astronomer Jean @-@ Luc Margot proposed a mathematical criterion that determines whether an object can clear its orbit during the lifetime of its host star , based on the mass of the planet , its semimajor axis , and the mass of its host star .

  "In the 19th century , the writer Rev. Norman Macleod ( 1783 – 1862 ) recalled seeing the Fairy Flag during his childhood around 1799 ( see relevant section below ) . He described the flag as then having crosses wrought in gold thread , and several \" elf spots \" stitched upon it . N.

In August 1814 , Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle on the Isle of Skye , and wrote of the visit in his diary . One of several items he mentioned seeing was the Fairy Flag . Scott described it as \" a pennon of silk , with something like round red rowan @-@ berries wrought upon it \" .

In 1927 , Roderick Charles MacLeod described the flag as then being square and brown . He measured it as about 18 inches ( 46 cm ) squared . He considered the flag to have originally been much larger ; and remarked on its extreme fragility and the requirement for careful handling , if it should be handled at all . R.C. MacLeod noted N.

  "This concept was still very new in the 1690s , and few new cities had had reason to be built in Europe – Christopher Wren 's city plan after the Great Fire of London in 1666 having been turned down because of the complexities of land ownership there . There were some other examples such as Richelieu , and later Saint Petersburg . The prototype may well have been the new city of Terra del Sole , constructed in 1564 . Another of the first towns to be planned using symmetry and order rather than an evolution of small alleys and streets was Alessandria in southern Piedmont . A little later , from 1711 , this Baroque form of planning was favoured in the Hispanic colonies of South America , especially by the Portuguese in Brazil . In other parts of Europe , lack of finance , complex land ownership and divided public opinion made radical replanning after disaster too difficult : after 1666 , London was rebuilt on its ancient plan , though new extensions to the west were partially on a grid system . In Sicily , public opinion ( the public being anyone not a member of the ruling class ) counted for nothing , and hence these seemingly revolutionary new concepts of town planning could be freely executed .",

  "Usually , the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old . Sometimes this introduction to pride life occurs earlier , however , particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time . For instance , lionesses in a pride often synchronise their reproductive cycles so that they cooperate in the raising and suckling of the young ( once the cubs are past the initial stage of isolation with their mother ) , who suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride . In addition to greater protection , the synchronization of births also has an advantage in that the cubs end up being roughly the same size , and thus have an equal chance of survival . If one lioness gives birth to a litter of cubs a couple of months after another lioness , for instance , then the younger cubs , being much smaller than their older brethren , usually are dominated by larger cubs at mealtimes – consequently , death by starvation is more common among the younger cubs .",

  "Warfarin and related 4 @-@ hydroxycoumarin @-@ containing molecules decrease blood coagulation by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase , an enzyme that recycles oxidized vitamin K1 to its reduced form after it has participated in the carboxylation of several blood coagulation proteins , mainly prothrombin and factor VII .

Thus , the pharmacologic action may always be reversed by fresh vitamin K1 . When administered , these drugs do not anticoagulate blood immediately . Instead , onset of their effect requires about two to three days before remaining active clotting factors have had time to naturally disappear in metabolism , and the duration of action of a single dose of warfarin is 2 to 5 days .

Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music should be given to the composers who worked with him , Raksin – who worked with Chaplin on Modern Times – stressed Chaplin 's creative position and active participation in the composing process .

Riley authored a poem imitating the style of Edgar Allan Poe and submitted it to the Kokomo Dispatch under a fictitious name claiming it was a long lost Poe poem .

  "You Only Live Twice is the twelfth book ( the eleventh novel ) of Fleming 's Bond series and the last book completed by Fleming before his death . The story is the third part of the Blofeld trilogy , coming after Thunderball , where SPECTRE is introduced , and On Her Majesty 's Secret Service , where Blofeld is involved in the murder of Bond 's wife . You Only Live Twice was the last book by Fleming that was published in his lifetime : he died five months after the UK release of the novel . It was written in January and February 1963 in Jamaica at Fleming 's Goldeneye estate . The original manuscript was 170 pages long and the least revised of all Fleming 's novels , with a mood that is dark and claustrophobic , reflecting Fleming 's own increasing melancholia . The story was written after the film version of Dr. No was released in 1962 , and Bond 's personality was somewhat skewed towards the screen persona rather than simply to Fleming himself ; Sean Connery 's filmic depiction of Bond affected the book version , with You Only Live Twice giving Bond a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories , although Fleming himself was part Scottish .

One example of this would be protozoan foraminiferans , certain species of which are distributed from the Arctic to the Antarctic . Other faunal groups , such as the polychaete worms and isopod crustaceans , appear to be endemic to certain specific plains and basins . Many apparently unique taxa of nematode worms have also been recently discovered on abyssal plains . This suggests that the very deep ocean has fostered adaptive radiations . The taxonomic composition of the nematode fauna in the abyssal Pacific is similar , but not identical to , that of the North Atlantic . A list of some of the species that have been discovered or redescribed by CeDAMar can be found here .",

  "Industrial metal suffered a critical backlash at the turn of the millennium . In an April 2000 review for the Chicago Sun Times , Jim DeRogatis dismissed Nine Inch Nails ' new music as a \" generic brand of industrial thrash \" and accused Ministry of repeating an act that \" was old by 1992 \" . Although The Fragile reached the top spot of the Billboard 200 and went on to earn double platinum status , DeRogatis considered it a \" flop \" nonetheless . Around this time , veteran industrial metal artists ( Ministry , Godflesh , and White Zombie ) began to repudiate the industrial label . Sales remained high throughout 2000 – 2005 ; at least 10 million records were sold during that time frame . Many groups began to take influence from hip hop and electronic music , in addition to industrial metal . As a result , acts like Powerman 5000 are often described as industrial metal as well as nu metal .",
