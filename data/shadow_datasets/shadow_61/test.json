  "Zap2it writer Rick Porter called \" Flu Season \" one of the best episodes of Parks and Recreation , particularly praising the \" outstanding teamup \" of Ron and the \" different shades of Ann \" displayed in the show . Porter said he simultaneously loved both Lowe 's over @-@ the @-@ top performance while sick , and Poehler 's more subtle performance . Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic said the way Chris has become so well integrated into the show demonstrates how well the writers keep seemingly ridiculous characters grounded . Richenthal said Poehler made her sick scenes seem like strong character moments rather than just slapstick comedy , and praised the scenes with Ron and Andy , as well as Tom 's scenes at the spa . Joel Keller of TV Squad said the episode strongly developed the characters Ben and Chris , and served as a showcase for the comedic talents of Poehler , who he complimented for not going too over the top . Hollywood.com writer Eric Sundermann said the episode showcased Parks and Recreation at its finest , and said both Poehler and Lowe gave some of their best performance to date . Sundermann praised the pairing of Offerman and Pratt , and said although he had reservations about a Ben and Leslie romance , he believed it got off to a charming start in \" Flu Season \" .",

  "In November 2007 , The Scotsman reported that Rowling had threatened legal action against American computer programmer G. Norman Lippert for allegedly violating her intellectual property rights by producing and publishing the online novel , James Potter and the Hall of Elders ' Crossing , an unofficial and unauthorised continuation of the Harry Potter series . Written as a fan fiction project for Lippert 's wife and sons , the novel is set eighteen years after the end of the last official installment in the series , Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , and describes the adventures of Harry Potter 's son , James Sirius Potter , during his first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry . A specialist in intellectual property law at Strathclyde University commented that , \" If an insubstantial character from a novel is taken and built up by another author in a new story , that can be a defence against copyright infringements . \" However , after Lippert offered Rowling an advance copy of the novel , Rowling dismissed her threat and said she supported the novel and any others like it . Lippert subsequently produced a sequel , James Potter and the Curse of the Gatekeeper . After the novel first appeared online in early November 2007 , some Harry Potter fans on the Internet initially speculated that the site might be part of an elaborate viral marketing campaign for an official continuation or spinoff of Harry Potter , one either written or at least approved by Rowling herself . On 9 November 2007 , Rowling 's agent Neil Blair denied that Rowling was in any way involved with the purported project , and Warner Bros. , the studio which owns the rights to the Harry Potter film series , denied that the novel was in any way connected to the official Harry Potter franchise .",

  "However , events in the Italian Wars helped bring the Swabian War to an end . The French king Louis XII tried to bring the Duchy of Milan under his control . As long as the Swabian War continued , the Milanese ruler Ludovico il Moro — whose niece Bianca Maximilian had married in 1493 — could not expect help from either Swiss mercenaries or Maximilian , and thus his envoy Galeazzo Visconti tried to mediate between the Swiss and the king . The French delegation at the Tagsatzung , the federal diet and war council of the Swiss , tried to prevent any agreement for the same reason . The Milanese delegation prevailed in these intrigations and succeeded to persuade both sides to moderate their demands . Finally , a peace treaty between Maximilian I and the Swiss was signed in Basel on September 22 , 1499 . The peace treaty carefully played down the whole war from the \" imperial war \" that Maximilian had tried to make it by declaring the ban over the Confederacy to what it actually was : a war between two equal members of the empire ( Imperial estate , or Reichsstände ) , namely the House of Habsburg and the Swiss Confederacy . The document referred to Maximilian only as \" duke of Habsburg \" , not as \" king of the Germans \" or even \" Holy Roman Emperor \" .",

  "Taylor made his NFL regular season debut on September 6 , 1981 , in a 24 – 10 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles . Aside from incurring a penalty for a late hit on Eagles running back Perry Harrington , Taylor played a nondescript game . In a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals later in the season , Taylor rushed and sacked the passer when he was supposed to drop into coverage . When told by Parcells that was not what he was assigned to do on that play , and that what he did was not in the playbook , Taylor responded \" Well , we better put it in on Monday , because that play 's a dandy . \" He recorded 9 @.@ 5 sacks in 1981 , and his rookie season is considered one of the best in NFL history . He was named 1981 's NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year , making him as of 2013 the only rookie to win an Offensive or Defensive Player of the Year award . Taylor 's arrival helped the Giants defense reduce their points allowed from 425 points in 1980 to 257 in 1981 . They finished the season 9 – 7 , up five games from the previous season , and advanced to the NFL divisional playoffs , where they lost 38 – 24 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers . The San Francisco win was due partly to a new tactic 49ers coach Bill Walsh used to slow Taylor . Walsh assigned guard John Ayers , the team 's best blocker , to block Taylor and , although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles , he was not as effective as normal . In contrast to his on @-@ field success Taylor was already developing a reputation for recklessness off the field ; after nearly getting killed during the season when his speeding resulted in a car crash , Young told the team 's trainer he would be surprised if the linebacker lived past the age of 30 , and the Giants insured Taylor 's life for $ 2 million .",

  "Following the Fourth Crusade , the Orthodox clergy in the two main Greek states , Epirus and Nicaea , had effectively become separated . In 1208 , the Nicaeans had convened a synod and elected Michael Autoreianos as successor to the vacant see of the Patriarch of Constantinople . The election was uncanonical and therefore of questionable legitimacy . This in turn meant that Laskaris ' imperial title was also open to challenge , as he had been crowned by the same Michael Autoreianos . Already under Michael I , two local synods of bishops had emerged in the Epirote domains to carry on administration of the Church , largely independent of the Patriarch , one at Naupaktos under John Apokaukos , and one at Ohrid under Chomatianos . The more ambitious Chomatianos soon became the pre @-@ eminent \" western \" bishop , and sought to strengthen the de facto Epirote autonomy in ecclesiastical affairs , including the appointment of bishops for the local sees without the Patriarch 's interference . This policy , which dovetailed with Theodore 's own ambitions of independence from and rivalry towards Nicaea , brought the two branches of the Greek Church to an open quarrel , as the Nicaea @-@ based patriarch Manuel I Sarantenos began appointing bishops of his own to Epirote sees , whom the Epirotes refused to accept . Despite his close ties to Epirus , Stefan II Nemanjić exploited the Epirote – Nicaean rivalry to his advantage to secure autocephaly for the Serbian Church , which traditionally had been under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Ohrid . Brushing aside Chomatianos ' vehement objections , Stefan managed to have his brother Rastko , renamed Sava , consecrated by Manuel Sarantenos as autocephalous archbishop of Serbia in 1219 . Theodore took care not to let the quarrels of the churchmen affect his cordial relations with the Serbian ruler .",

  "Many actin @-@ related molecules create a free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre @-@ existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores . However , the Arp2 / 3 complex stimulates actin polymerization by creating a new nucleation core . Actin nucleation is an initial step in the formation of an actin filament . The nucleation core activity of Arp2 / 3 is activated by members of the Wiskott @-@ Aldrich syndrome family protein ( WASP , N @-@ WASP , WAVE , and WASH proteins ) . The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2 / 3 complex to create a nucleation core . However , de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks , since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre @-@ existing filaments . Thus , the Arp2 / 3 complex binds to pre @-@ existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the old ones and form a functional actin cytoskeleton . Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament .",

Both the French and the Russians suffered terribly but the Russians had reserve troops , and a clear advantage in the logistics war . The French Army supplies came over a long road lined with hostile forces . According to Rhien , so long as the Russian Army existed the French continued to lose . This victory ultimately cost Napoleon his army , as it allowed the French emperor to believe that the campaign was winnable , exhausting his forces as he went on to Moscow to await a surrender that would never come .

At first they found few bones , until they cut away herbage that covered the deepest part of the swamp , where they found many fossils . The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos , but very few skull and wing bones , possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped .

By early August , Carey already had two original songs written alongside Afanasieff ; the \" sad and balld @-@ y \" \" Miss You Most ( At Christmas Time ) \" and the \" Gospel @-@ tinged and religious \" \" Jesus Born on This Day \" . The third and final original song the pair planned to write was to be centered and inspired and in the vein of a \" Phil Spector , old rock ' n roll , sixties @-@ sounding Christmas song \" . Critics have noted the song 's 1940 's , 1950 's , and 1960 's influences , and in conjunction with Carey 's voice and its simplistic melody , heralded it as its recipe for success . In discussing the song 's chord progression and stylistic approaches , Slate 's Adam Ragusea hailed the song as \" the only Christmas song written in the last half @-@ century worthy of inclusion in the Great American Songbook . \" The A.V. Club 's Annie Zaleski attributes the song 's enduring appeal to its ambiguity in being able to pin it down as belonging to a specific era . The song begins with a \" sparking \" bit of percussion \" that resembles an antique music box or a whimsical snow globe . \" After Carey 's a capella style vocal introduction , the song introduces other seasonal percussive signifiers including ; celebratory church @-@ like bells , cheerful sleigh bells , and \" an underlying rhythmic beat that sounds like the loping pace of a horse or reindeer . These sounds echo religious and secular musical touchstones , without veering blatantly too much in either direction , and give the song an upbeat , joyous tone . \" In an interview in 1994 , Carey described the song as \" fun \" , and continued : \" It 's very traditional , old @-@ fashioned Christmas . It 's very retro , kind of ' 60s . \" Afanasieff went further in breaking down the song 's musical elements : \" A lush bed of keyboards , reminiscent of a small @-@ scale Wall of Sound , cushions the song 's cheery rhythms , while a soulful vocal chorus adds robust oohs , tension @-@ creating counter @-@ melodies , and festive harmonies . Most notably , however , the song 's jaunty piano chords and melody keep the song merrily bouncing along . \" Critics noted the song a tad reminiscent of the works of Judy Garland and Nat King Cole , while also describing it as hearkening back to \" ' 60s and ' 70s Motown covers of prewar Christmas classics , such as The Jackson 5 's [ and ] Stevie Wonder \" . Slate 's Ragusea conceded that \" All I Want For Christmas Is You \" \" sounds like it could have been written in the ' 40s and locked in a Brill Building safe . \"",
  "Between 1877 and 1931 , Albert A. Michelson made multiple measurements of the speed of light . His 1877 – 79 measurements were performed under the auspices of Simon Newcomb , who was also working on measuring the speed of light . Michelson 's setup incorporated several refinements on Foucault 's original arrangement . As seen in Figure 5 , Michelson placed the rotating mirror R near the principal focus of lens L ( i.e. the focal point given incident parallel rays of light ) . If the rotating mirror R were exactly at the principal focus , the moving image of the slit would remain upon the distant plane mirror M ( equal in diameter to lens L ) as long as the axis of the pencil of light remained on the lens , this being true regardless of the RM distance . Michelson was thus able to increase the RM distance to nearly 2000 feet . To achieve a reasonable value for the RS distance , Michelson used an extremely long focal length lens ( 150 feet ) and compromised on the design by placing R about 15 feet closer to L than the principal focus . This allowed an RS distance of between 28 @.@ 5 to 33 @.@ 3 feet . He used carefully calibrated tuning forks to monitor the rotation rate of the air @-@ turbine @-@ powered mirror R , and he would typically measure displacements of the slit image on the order of 115 mm . His 1879 figure for the speed of light , 299944 ± 51 km / s , was within about 0 @.@ 05 % of the modern value . His 1926 repeat of the experiment incorporated still further refinements such as the use of polygonal prism @-@ shaped rotating mirrors ( enabling a brighter image ) having from eight through sixteen facets and a 22 mile baseline surveyed to fractional parts @-@ per @-@ million accuracy . His figure of 299 @,@ 796 ± 4 km / s was only about 4 km / s higher than the current accepted value . Michelson 's final 1931 attempt to measure the speed of light in vacuum was interrupted by his death . Although his experiment was completed posthumously by F. G. Pease and F. Pearson , various factors militated against a measurement of highest accuracy , including an earthquake which disturbed the baseline measurement .",

  "Noting the attention to detail of the series ' launch sequences , Jonathan Bignell argues that part of the motivation for dedicating large amounts of screen time to the Thunderbird craft is the need to compensate for the limited mobility of the puppet cast . The focus on futuristic machines has also been explored by cultural historian Nicholas J. Cull , who comments that of all the Andersons ' series , Thunderbirds is the most evocative of a recurring theme : the \" necessity of the human component of the machine \" , whereby the failures of new technology are overcome by \" brave human beings and technology working together \" . This makes the series ' vision of the 2060s \" wonderfully humanistic and reassuring \" . O 'Brien similarly praises this optimism , comparing the Tracy family to guardian Übermensch . Writing for Wired UK magazine , Warren Ellis asserts that the series ' scientific vision could inspire the next generation of \" mad and frightening engineers \" , adding that Thunderbirds \" trades in vast , demented concepts ... immense and very beautiful ideas as solutions to problems . \"",

Furthermore , it helps resolve what has been called \" Reid 's paradox \" , which states that migration during glaciation events must have been impossible for plants with dispersal rates under several hundred meters per year , such as Trillium grandiflorum . Thus occasional long distance dispersal events , such as by deer , probably helped save this and other species with otherwise short distance dispersal ability from extinction during the glaciations of the ice ages . Furthermore , nested clade analysis of cpDNA haplotypes has shown that Trillium grandiflorum is likely to have persisted through the last glacial period in two sites of refuge in the southeastern United States and that long distance dispersal was responsible for the post @-@ glacial recolonization of northern areas .",

  "The poem was the first of Eliot 's that relied on speech , with a narrator who speaks to the audience directly . Described as a poem of early summer , air , and grace , it begins with a narrator recalling a moment in a garden . The scene provokes a discussion on time and how the present , not the future or past , really matters to individuals . Memories connect the individual to the past , but the past cannot change . The poem then transitions from memory to how life works and the point of existence . In particular , the universe is described as orderly and that consciousness is not found within time even though humanity is bound by time . The scene of the poem moves from a garden to the London underground where technology dominates . Those who cling to technology and reason are unable to understand the universe or the Logos ( \" the Word \" , or Christ ) . The underworld is replaced by a churchyard and a discussion of death .

  "The species was described as new to science by American mycologists Rolf Singer and Alexander H.

They published a short description in Latin in a 1958 Mycologia publication , followed by a more detailed description in English later that year . According to Psilocybe specialist Gastón Guzmán , the species Psilocybe acutissima ( described by Roger Heim in 1958 ) , and Psilocybe isauri ( described by Singer in 1959 ) are synonyms , as both the macroscopic and microscopic features are the same in the type material of all three . Singer considered P. isauri a species distinct from P. yungensis because of differences in the hairiness of the stem surface . Smith named the variety P. yungensis var. diconica for specimens he found with conical , rather than obconical ( the form of an inverted cone ) papilla . Similarly , the main distinguishing feature that Heim ascribed to P. acutissima was a papillate cap ( somewhat resembling the shape of a female human breast ) . Later studies showed that these morphological variations did not warrant individual recognition , because of the variable nature of these characteristics , and the existence of intermediate forms .",

During the album 's recording , Carey and Mottola separated , with Carey citing it as her way of achieving freedom , and a new lease on life . Aside from the album 's different approach , critics took notice of Carey 's altered style of singing , which she described as breathy vocals . Her new @-@ found style of singing was met with mixed reception ; some critics felt this was a sign of maturity , that she did not feel the need to always show off her upper range , while others felt it was a sign of her weakening and waning voice .

  "Roentgenium is the ninth member of the 6d series of transition metals . Since copernicium ( element 112 ) has been shown to be a transition metal , it is expected that all the elements from 104 to 112 would form a fourth transition metal series . Calculations on its ionization potentials and atomic and ionic radii are similar to that of its lighter homologue gold , thus implying that roentgenium 's basic properties will resemble those of the other group 11 elements , copper , silver , and gold ; however , it is also predicted to show several differences from its lighter homologues .",

  "The trial began in June 1934 before Justice William Ives with three days of testimony from MacMillan . Brownlee 's lawyer , Arthur LeRoy Smith , used his cross examination to call into question almost everything MacMillan said . To refute her claim that Brownlee had convinced her to move to Edmonton , he entered into evidence a letter she had written to Alberta College seeking information on its programs , dated before she had even met Brownlee . He further demonstrated that on the evening of the seduction , which had allegedly taken place in a car on a side road west of Edmonton , the city had been engulfed in a blizzard . Moreover , the government car in which the seduction was supposed to have taken place had not been purchased until more than a year after that date .

  "While Richard was still in Sicily , word reached the king of the disputes between William Longchamp , whom Richard had left in England , and John , Richard 's younger brother . On 2 April 1191 Richard sent Coutances back from Sicily to England . The archbishop landed in England on 27 June , after a short detour to Rome . Coutances received a release from his crusading vow , and returned to England in the company of Richard 's mother , Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine . He had a number of royal documents authorising him to settle the disputes , and on 28 July a settlement was reached that left Longchamp in control , although John still retained sufficient power to make Longchamp 's grip on the government somewhat insecure . In September , however , Longchamp imprisoned Richard 's bastard half @-@ brother , Geoffrey , Archbishop of York , who was attempting to return to England after having been banished by the king . The imprisonment renewed memories of the murder of Thomas Becket almost 20 years earlier , and Geoffrey was quickly released . Longchamp was brought to a council , headed by Coutances and a number of the clerical and lay lords of England , which took place on 5 October 1191 at Loddon Bridge on the River Thames . Longchamp was deposed and exiled , largely because Coutances had a royal document ordering the magnates to obey Coutances ' if the archbishop 's advice was resisted by Longchamp , which it had been . Although the medieval chronicler Richard of Devizes accused Coutances of duplicity , and of trying to play both sides against the other , the evidence suggests that Coutances was genuinely trying to solve the dispute in the king 's interest . Longchamp fled to Normandy , and he was excommunicated by Coutances .",

The idea was inspired by a clip of a serial killer 's interview with the CIA which Shearsmith had seen online ; this , too , had a main feed with three smaller feeds giving different views of the scene .

  "The third phase received the least consideration , but naval planners were aware that Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan . Moreover , the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore , the weaker it would become . If American assistance was forthcoming , there was the prospect of Manila being used as a forward base . The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical , but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds . They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade . From personal experience they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation at the heart of a maritime empire , and felt that economic pressure would suffice .",

  "Ten by Eight , stylized as 10 × 8 , is a puzzle video game by Action Button Entertainment where players match tiles . It was released on July 31 , 2013 in North America for PlayStation Mobile — the PlayStation Vita and compatible devices . International editions followed .

From these it is possible to infer the mass and angular momentum of the final object , which match independent predictions from numerical simulations of the merger . The frequency and decay time of the dominant mode are determined by the geometry of the photon sphere .

  "During October 20 , 2006 the Fiji Meteorological Service and the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to monitor a tropical depression , that had developed within the South Pacific Convergence Zone to the north of Temotu Province in the Solomon Islands . The system was located within an area of low to moderate vertical wind shear and had a good outflow in its northern and eastern quadrants . Over the next day conditions surrounding the system rapidly became favourable for further development , with convection starting to wrap into a well defined low level circulation centre . As a result , the depression rapidly developed further and was named Xavier by the FMS during October 22 , after it had become a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale . After the system was named the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 01P , while it was located over the Santa Cruz Islands . Throughout October 22 , Xavier 's rapid intensification continued with it developing an eye feature and becoming a category 3 severe tropical cyclone . During that day the system performed a small cyclonic loop over Temotu Province and passed near or over the Santa Cruz Island of Tikopia .",

Maggie Roswell was assigned to voice the character and she originally based it on Milhouse , who is voiced by Pamela Hayden . The producers felt that her impression sounded out of place so she ended up using a more normal sounding voice . It was Gewirtz who in this episode gave Milhouse his last name , Van Houten , which he got from one of his wife 's friends .",
  "The battle 's impact on the American Revolutionary War in the southern theater was minor , but the failure of Patriot militia to significantly stall Cornwallis at Cowan 's Ford and Torrence 's Tavern caused Greene to hasten his retreat towards his ultimate goal , Guilford Courthouse , where he determined to rendezvous with a detached force under the command of Isaac Huger . The total impact of Torrence 's Tavern alone , however , has been rated as especially minor , since the Continental Army force commanded by Greene managed to escape Cornwallis ' advance regardless of the short engagement 's outcome , and given the more substantial delay to the British caused by the defense at Cowan 's Ford the previous day .",

  "The great tit has generally adjusted to human modifications of the environment . It is more common and has better breeding success in areas with undisturbed forest cover , but it has adapted to human modified habitats . It can be very common in urban areas . For example , the breeding population in the city of Sheffield ( a city of half a million people ) has been estimated at 17 @,@ 164 individuals . In adapting to human environments its song has been observed to change in noise @-@ polluted urban environments . In areas with low frequency background noise pollution , the song has a higher frequency than in quieter areas . This tit has expanded its range , moving northwards into Scandinavia and Scotland , and south into Israel and Egypt . The total population is estimated at between 300 – 1 @,@ 100 million birds in a range of 32 @.@ 4 million km2 ( 12 @.@ 5 million sq mi ) . While there have been some localised declines in population in areas with poorer quality habitats , its large range and high numbers mean that the great tit is not considered to be threatened , and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List .",
  "The loss of a royal court also meant there was no force to counter the Kirk 's dislike of theatre , which struggled to survive in Scotland . However , it was not entirely extinguished . The Kirk used theatre for its own purposes in schools and was slow to suppress popular folk dramas . Surviving plays for the period include William Alexander 's Monarchicke Tragedies , written just before his departure with the king for England in 1603 . They were closet dramas , designed to be read rather than performed , and already indicate Alexander 's preference for southern English over the Scots language . There were some attempts to revive Scottish drama . In 1663 Edinburgh lawyer William Clerke wrote Marciano or the Discovery , a play about the restoration of a legitimate dynasty in Florence after many years of civil war . It was performed at the Tennis @-@ Court Theatre at Holyrood Palace before the parliamentary high commissioner John Leslie , Earl of Rothes . Thomas Sydsurf 's Tarugo 's Wiles or the Coffee House , was first performed in London in 1667 and then in Edinburgh the year after and drew on Spanish comedy . A relative of Sydsurf , physician Archibald Pitcairne ( 1652 – 1713 ) wrote The Assembly or Scotch Reformation ( 1692 ) , a ribald satire on the morals of the Presbyterian Kirk , circulating in manuscript , but not published until 1722 , helping to secure the association between Jacobitism and professional drama that discouraged the creation of professional theatre .",

Lieutenant Colonel Terence Otway , who compiled the official history of the British Army 's airborne forces during the Second World War , analysed the brigades ' actions throughout the campaign . In terms of the brigades airborne operations , he stated that the missions conducted by 1st and 2nd Parachute Battalions were \" severely handicapped \" by a lack of aerial photography and a shortage of maps , as well as the lack of experience on the part of the American air crews who dropped both battalions at the beginning of their missions , causing highly inaccurate and dispersed drops . He also believed that a \" lack of an expert in airborne matters at either Allied Forces Headquarters or First Army \" ensured that the brigade was not used as efficiently as they might have been , and that this lack of expertise meant that logistical and planning arrangements before each mission could have been better .",

Although the Anglican mass emphasises the Epistle to the Romans , Swift relied on Corinthians in order to combat religious schismatic tendencies in a similar manner to his criticism of dissenters in \" On Mutual Subjection \" .",
  "On July 15 , 1784 , Kościuszko set off for Poland , where he arrived on August 26 . Due to a conflict between his patrons , the Czartoryski family , and King Stanisław August Poniatowski , Kościuszko once again failed to get a commission in the Commonwealth Army . He settled in Siechnowicze ( Belarusian : Сяхновічы , now Sehnovichi , Belarus ) . His brother Józef had lost most of the family 's lands through bad investments , but with the help of his sister Anna , Kościuszko secured part of the lands for himself . He decided to limit his male peasants ' corvée ( obligatory service to the lord of the manor ) to two days a week , and completely exempted the female peasants . His estate soon stopped being profitable , and he began going into debt . The situation was not helped by failure of the money promised by the American government — interest on late payment for his seven years ' military service — to materialize . Kościuszko struck up friendships with liberal activists ; Hugo Kołłątaj offered him a position as lecturer at Kraków 's Jagiellonian University , which Kościuszko declined .",

The narration also served to give gentle hints to the player , and expand upon the setting and add depth to the experience .

The Prince 's interactions with Farah were also an important factor .

Bach , he would have heard symphonies from leading London composers including Thomas Arne , William Boyce and Giuseppe Sammartini — \" a nearly ideal introduction to the genre \" , according to Zaslaw . The earliest symphonies , Zaslaw points out , while not in the same class as the later Mozart masterpieces , are comparable in length , complexity and originality to those written at the same time by the acknowledged symphonic masters of the day . Indeed , Abel 's Symphony No. 6 in E Flat was similar enough in style and technique to be mistaken as Mozart 's , and is listed as such ( Symphony No. 3 , K. 18 ) in the original Köchel catalogue . Sadie observes that the K. 22 symphony composed in The Hague is a good deal more sophisticated than the earlier ones which were written in London .",

It can reach speeds of up to 50 kilometres per hour ( 27 kn ) over short distances . However , it is not a remarkable diver , reaching relatively shallow depths for five to fifteen minutes . Between dives , the whale surfaces for a few minutes , remaining visible in clear , calm waters , with blows occurring at intervals of about 60 seconds ( range : 45 – 90 sec . ) . Unlike the fin whale , the sei whale tends not to rise high out of the water as it dives , usually just sinking below the surface . The blowholes and dorsal fin are often exposed above the water surface almost simultaneously . The whale almost never lifts its flukes above the surface , and are generally less active on water surfaces than close related Bryde 's whales ; it rarely breaches .",

It appears likely that after the initial reorganization of the Exchequer , Nigel 's involvement lessened . He continued to be active , though , and obtained tax exemptions and other privileges until his death in 1169 . His son , Richard fitzNeal , who is the main source for information about Nigel 's career in the Exchequer , stated that he fulfilled Nigel 's treasury duties when Nigel was ill . Nigel continued to spar with Robert , the Earl of Leicester , and Richard fitzNeal relays a story about Nigel and Robert confronting each other at the Exchequer over traditional exemptions of the barons of the Exchequer , or judges of the Exchequer . Among the reforms carried out by Nigel were the restoration of the \" blanch farm \" system , whereby a random sample of coins was assayed and any shortage was collected from the sheriff , and the restoration of collections from a swath of counties that had quit paying taxes during Stephen 's reign . The most substantial change was the return to a unified system of finances , which in turn required a reconciliation of the two different systems in use by Stephen and Matilda . Despite Nigel 's reinstatement to the Exchequer , and the nomination of his son as treasurer , Nigel did not enjoy the power that his uncle had wielded under Henry I. The exact date of Richard 's appointment as treasurer is obscure , but it was sometime between 1158 and 1160 , as he is securely attested as treasurer in 1160 . The Liber Eliensis states that Nigel paid the king £ 400 to secure the office for Richard . Some historians have seen Nigel as Henry II 's \" minister of finance \" .",

  "Priscus or Priskos ( Greek : Πρῖσκος ; died 613 ) was a leading East Roman ( Byzantine ) general during the reigns of the Byzantine emperors Maurice ( reigned 582 – 602 ) , Phocas ( r . 602 – 610 ) and Heraclius ( r . 610 – 641 ) . Priscus comes across as an effective and capable military leader , although the contemporary sources are markedly biased in his favour . Under Maurice , he distinguished himself in the campaigns against the Avars and their Slavic allies in the Balkans . Absent from the capital at the time of Maurice 's overthrow and murder by Phocas , he was one of the few of Maurice 's senior aides who were able to survive unharmed into the new regime , remaining in high office and even marrying the new emperor 's daughter . Priscus , however , also negotiated with and assisted Heraclius in the overthrow of Phocas , and was entrusted with command against the Persians in 611 – 612 . After the failure of this campaign , he was dismissed and tonsured . He died shortly after .",

  "In the mid @-@ 1980s , Swiss physician René Flammer discovered an antigen within the mushroom that stimulates an autoimmune reaction causing the body 's immune cells to consider its own red blood cells as foreign and attack them . Despite this , it was not until 1990 that guidebooks firmly warned against eating P. involutus , and one Italian guidebook recommended it as edible in 1998 . The relatively rare immunohemolytic syndrome occurs following the repeated ingestion of Paxillus mushrooms . Most commonly it arises when the person has ingested the mushroom for a long period of time , sometimes for many years , and has shown mild gastrointestinal symptoms on previous occasions . The Paxillus syndrome is better classed as an allergic reaction than a toxicological reaction as it is not caused by a genuinely poisonous substance but by the antigen in the mushroom . The antigen is still of unknown structure but it stimulates the formation of IgG antibodies in the blood serum . In the course of subsequent meals , antigen @-@ antibody complexes are formed ; these complexes attach to the surface of blood cells and eventually lead to their breakdown .",

It has been suggested that the two species ( forming a group ) could have a coevolutionary pathway with beech . The specific epithet is derived from a Latin adjective blennius , meaning \" slimy \" . Lactarius mushrooms are commonly known as milkcaps , and L. blennius is known as the Slimy Milkcap or the Beech Milkcap .",

  "Covered interest rate parity ( CIRP ) is found to hold when there is open capital mobility and limited capital controls , and this finding is confirmed for all currencies freely traded in the present @-@ day . One such example is when the United Kingdom and Germany abolished capital controls between 1979 and 1981 . Maurice Obstfeld and Alan Taylor calculated hypothetical profits as implied by the expression of a potential inequality in the CIRP equation ( meaning a difference in returns on domestic versus foreign assets ) during the 1960s and 1970s , which would have constituted arbitrage opportunities if not for the prevalence of capital controls . However , given financial liberalization and resulting capital mobility , arbitrage temporarily became possible until equilibrium was restored . Since the abolition of capital controls in the United Kingdom and Germany , potential arbitrage profits have been near zero . Factoring in transaction costs arising from fees and other regulations , arbitrage opportunities are fleeting or nonexistent when such costs exceed deviations from parity . While CIRP generally holds , it does not hold with precision due to the presence of transaction costs , political risks , tax implications for interest earnings versus gains from foreign exchange , and differences in the liquidity of domestic versus foreign assets . Researchers found evidence that significant deviations from CIRP during the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007 and 2008 were driven by concerns over risk posed by counter parties to banks and financial institutions in Europe and the US in the foreign exchange swap market . The European Central Bank 's efforts to provide US dollar liquidity in the foreign exchange swap market , along with similar efforts by the Federal Reserve , had a moderating impact on CIRP deviations between the dollar and the euro . Such a scenario was found to be reminiscent of deviations from CIRP during the 1990s driven by struggling Japanese banks which looked toward foreign exchange swap markets to try and acquire dollars to bolster their creditworthiness .",

  "Johnson cautions against labelling Mary and Ann 's relationship lesbian , since the identity @-@ defining concepts of heterosexuality and homosexuality did not exist during the 18th century ; she maintains , rather , that their relationship is a bond which cannot be articulated through language . This bond is perhaps best described as erotic rather than overtly sexual . Further evidence to support such an interpretation comes from Wollstonecraft 's life . Wollstonecraft based her portrait of Ann on her close friend , Fanny Blood , and when her husband , William Godwin , came to write his Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman ( 1798 ) , he described Fanny and Wollstonecraft 's first meeting as similar to the one between the tortured lovers Charlotte and Werther in Goethe 's sentimental novel The Sorrows of Young Werther ( 1774 ) . One biographer of Wollstonecraft notes that Hester Chapone 's Letters on the Improvement of the Mind , which influenced Wollstonecraft 's earlier Thoughts on the Education of Daughters ( 1787 ) , dedicates several chapters to these \" friends of the heart \" ; such friendships would not have seemed unusual to 18th @-@ century readers .",

  "Constant pressure charts normally contain plotted values of temperature , humidity , wind , and the vertical height above sea level of the pressure surface . They have a variety of uses . In the mountainous terrain of the western United States and Mexican Plateau , the 850 hPa pressure surface can be a more realistic depiction of the weather pattern than a standard surface analysis . Using the 850 and 700 hPa pressure surfaces , one can determine when and where warm advection ( coincident with upward vertical motion ) and cold advection ( coincident with downward vertical motion ) is occurring within the lower portions of the troposphere . Areas with small dewpoint depressions and are below freezing indicate the presence of icing conditions for aircraft . The 500 hPa pressure surface can be used as a rough guide for the motion of many tropical cyclones . Shallower tropical cyclones , which have experienced vertical wind shear , tend to be steered by winds at the 700 hPa level .",

  "People with signs of inadequate respiration or oxygenation may need to be intubated and mechanically ventilated . Mechanical ventilation aims to reduce pulmonary edema and increase oxygenation . Ventilation can reopen collapsed alveoli , but it is harmful for them to be repeatedly opened , and positive pressure ventilation can also damage the lung by overinflating it . Intubation is normally reserved for when respiratory problems occur , but most significant contusions do require intubation , and it may be done early in anticipation of this need . People with pulmonary contusion who are especially likely to need ventilation include those with prior severe lung disease or kidney problems ; the elderly ; those with a lowered level of consciousness ; those with low blood oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels ; and those who will undergo operations with anesthesia . Larger contusions have been correlated with a need for ventilation for longer periods of time .",

Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure , but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card .

  "The modern Welsh name for themselves is Cymry , and Cymru is the Welsh name for Wales . These words ( both of which are pronounced [ ˈkəm.rɨ ] ) are descended from the Brythonic word combrogi , meaning \" fellow @-@ countrymen \" . The use of the word Cymry as a self @-@ designation derives from the post @-@ Roman Era relationship of the Welsh with the Brythonic @-@ speaking peoples of northern England and southern Scotland , the peoples of \" Yr Hen Ogledd \" ( English : The Old North ) . It emphasised a perception that the Welsh and the \" Men of the North \" were one people , different from other peoples .

Alex Ross , in The New Yorker , quotes an entry from the composer 's 1927 diary , when the Eighth Symphony was allegedly under way : \" Isolation and loneliness are driving me to despair ...

If only there were a way out . \" Writers have pointed to the hand tremor that made writing difficult and to the alcoholism that afflicted him at numerous stages of his life . Others have argued that Sibelius 's exalted status as a national hero effectively silenced him ; he became afraid that any further major work would not live up to the expectations of the adoring nation . Andrew Barnett , another of the composer 's many biographers , points to Sibelius 's intense self @-@ criticism ; he would withhold or suppress anything that failed to meet his self @-@ imposed standards : \" It was this attitude that brought about the destruction of the Eighth Symphony , but the very same trait forced him to keep on revising the Fifth until it was perfect . \" The historian Mark McKenna agrees that Sibelius became stifled by a combination of perfectionism and increasing self @-@ doubt .

  "Loves of a Blonde has often been identified as one of the most significant and ambitious productions of the Czech New Wave , a movement in which a group of young filmmakers , many of whom were educated by the national film academy in Prague , including Forman , Ján Kadár , Věra Chytilová and Jiří Menzel , among others , took significant political risks by using cinema to protest the hypocrisy and absurdity of the Communist state . This movement has been attributed to a period of cultural and political reform , starting in 1962 , during which filmmakers were given state support but were also allowed a certain amount of relative artistic freedom , enabling them to create movies with the stated objective of making \" the Czech people collectively aware that they were participants in a system of oppression and incompetence which had brutalized them all . \"",

While echoing this view , Beatles biographer Philip Norman comments that , from the start , each of the group 's two principal songwriters shared a mutual disregard for the other 's new compositions : Lennon found McCartney 's songs \" cloyingly sweet and bland \" , while McCartney viewed Lennon 's as \" harsh , unmelodious and deliberately provocative \" .

  "On March 26 , 1895 , Scottish chemist Sir William Ramsay isolated helium on Earth by treating the mineral cleveite ( a variety of uraninite with at least 10 % rare earth elements ) with mineral acids . Ramsay was looking for argon but , after separating nitrogen and oxygen from the gas liberated by sulfuric acid , he noticed a bright yellow line that matched the D3 line observed in the spectrum of the Sun . These samples were identified as helium by Lockyer and British physicist William Crookes . It was independently isolated from cleveite in the same year by chemists Per Teodor Cleve and Abraham Langlet in Uppsala , Sweden , who collected enough of the gas to accurately determine its atomic weight . Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand prior to Ramsay 's discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite . Hillebrand , however , attributed the lines to nitrogen . His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near @-@ discovery in science .",

Various types of feeding traces were identified ; punctures , gouges , striae , fragmentary teeth , and combinations of the above marks . The bite marks probably represent feeding behaviour instead of aggression between the species , and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs .

  "The memorial forms a sharp contrast with both the earlier monuments of the South African War and most contemporary monuments to the First World War . Memorials of the South African War typically included figures of soldiers , sometimes dying in conflict , but always heroically in a \" beautiful death \" . Classical symbolism was often used to distance the event of death from the observer , as typified in William Colton 's work at Worcester . Most First World War memorials reacted to the criticism of this approach by adopting cleaner architectural forms , but still retaining the ideal of a \" beautiful death \" , an approach which can be seen at Lutyens ' Southampton War Memorial , the precursor to his more famous Cenotaph in London .

  "Sieges became a prominent part of the war with over 300 occurring during the period , many of them involving castles . Indeed , as Robert Liddiard suggests , the \" military role of some castles in the seventeenth century is out of all proportion to their medieval histories \" . Artillery formed an essential part of these sieges , with the \" characteristic military action \" according to military historian Stephen Bull , being \" an attack on a fortified strongpoint \" supported by artillery . The ratio of artillery pieces to defenders varied considerably in sieges , but in all cases there were more guns than in previous conflicts ; up to one artillery piece for every nine defenders was not unknown in extreme cases , such as near Pendennis Castle . The growth in the number and size of siege artillery favoured those who had the resources to purchase and deploy these weapons . Artillery had improved by the 1640s but was still not always decisive , as the lighter cannon of the period found it hard to penetrate earth and timber bulwarks and defences – demonstrated in the siege of Corfe . Mortars , able to lob fire over the taller walls , proved particularly effective against castles – in particular those more compact ones with smaller courtyards and open areas , such as at Stirling Castle .",
  "The overwhelming majority of reborn customers are older women . The process of buying a reborn can be done to simulate an adoption process , rather than a prosaic sale of a product . As part of this , the dolls often come with fake birth certificates or adoption certificates . Many women collect reborns as they would a non @-@ reborn doll , whilst others purchase them to fill a void of a lost child and may treat reborns as living babies . Media features and public receptions have used such adjectives as \" creepy \" to describe the reborns . This can be explained by the uncanny valley hypothesis . This states that as objects become more lifelike they gain an increasing empathetic response , until a certain point at which the response changes to repulsion . Department stores have refused to stock the dolls because of this reaction , claiming they are too lifelike .",

  "Vesicles sent off by the ER containing proteins are further altered at the Golgi apparatus and then prepared for secretion from the cell or transport to other parts of the cell . Various things can happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered space of the Golgi apparatus . The modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing . The Golgi apparatus removes and substitutes sugar monomers , producing a large variety of oligosaccharides . In addition to modifying proteins , the Golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself . In plant cells , the Golgi produces pectins and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure .",
  "In 1636 the space beneath the south west tower became a bishop 's consistory court . It was furnished as such at that time , and is now a unique survival in England , hearing its last case , that of an attempted suicide of a priest , in the 1930s . Until 1881 , the south transept , which is unusually large , also took on a separate function as an independent ecclesiastical entity : the parish church of St Oswald . Although the 17th century saw additions to the furnishings and fittings , there was no further building work for several centuries . By the 19th century , the building was badly in need of restoration . The present homogeneous appearance that the cathedral presents from many exterior angles is largely the work of Victorian restorers , particularly George Gilbert Scott .",
