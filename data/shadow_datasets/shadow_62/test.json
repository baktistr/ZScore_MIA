  "The decision was made over the objections of some victims and prosecutors involved in Clemmons ' previous cases but was supported by the bipartisan parole board and the trial court judge in Clemmons ' case . Mark Fraiser , an attorney who prosecuted early cases against Clemmons in Pulaski County , argued Clemmons was extremely likely to commit further acts of violence in the future , and said for a teen to receive such a lengthy prison sentence without committing a murder , \" you 've got to be a bad little dude \" . On May 3 , 2000 , Huckabee commuted Clemmons ' 108 @-@ year sentence to 47 years , 5 months and 19 days , which made him eligible for parole that day . As a factor in his decision , Huckabee cited the unusually long sentence for Clemmons ' age at the time the crimes were committed . The Arkansas Parole Board unanimously approved Clemmons ' release on July 13 , 2000 , and he was set free on August 1 , 2000 .",
  "Christianity probably arrived in Orkney in the 6th century and organised church authority emerged in the 8th century . The Buckquoy spindle @-@ whorl found at a Pictish site on Birsay is an Ogham – inscribed artefact whose interpretation has caused controversy although it is now generally considered to be of Irish Christian origin .",
  "The Rhinemaidens ' sorrow in the loss of the gold is deep and heartfelt . As the gods are crossing the rainbow bridge into Valhalla at the end of Das Rheingold , Loge ironically suggests that , in the absence of the gold , the maidens should \" bask in the gods ’ new @-@ found radiance \" . The maidens ' lament then becomes a stern reproof : \" Tender and true are only the depths \" , they sing ; \" False and cowardly is all that rejoices up there \" . In the final Götterdämmerung scene they show ruthlessness as , having recovered the ring , they drag the hapless Hagen down into the waters of the Rhine .",
  "The closing chorale , \" Erleucht auch unser Sinn und Herz \" ( Illumine our minds and hearts as well ) , is a four @-@ part setting for the choir , horn , oboes and strings .",
  "The day after the fall of Le Quesnoy , elements of the division moved through the Mormal Forest with the 1st Canterbury and 2nd Otago Battalions of the 2nd Brigade leading the way . As well as covering over 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) , they attacked and captured two houses occupied by German forces . Twenty men were killed in this last contact with the enemy , which marked the last offensive action of the division ; it was relieved that night . During the Hundred Days ' Offensive , it had advanced 100 kilometres ( 62 mi ) in 75 days . It was moving into reserve at Beauvois @-@ en @-@ Cambrésis , in the rear area of IV Corps , when the Armistice was signed on 11 November .",
  "As a bowler , Crawford 's technique was also orthodox , although he was unusual in using his second and third fingers to spin the ball — most bowlers used their first and second . His bowling pace varied from fast to medium , and he spun the ball so much that his fingers snapped audibly as he released it . An accurate bowler , it was difficult for batsmen to score runs against him . Crawford could swing the ball away from the bat , but his most effective delivery was his off break : Clem Hill stated that Crawford could make the ball turn several inches , despite the hard pitches prevalent in Australia when he played there . John Arlott described him as \" the schoolboy genius who turned on Australian pitches where no one else deviated from straight \" . In 1937 , Herbie Collins wrote , at a time when Wally Hammond was considered to be the world 's leading all @-@ rounder , that \" people who have seen both men consider [ Crawford ] a better all @-@ rounder \" .",
  "Brown appointed his first cabinet in the first few days of his premiership . David Miliband was appointed Foreign Secretary while Alistair Darling succeeded Brown as Chancellor of the Exchequer . Brown 's team also included Jacqui Smith , who became Britain 's first female Home Secretary . Jack Straw was appointed to the new role of Secretary of State for Justice . Brown advocated a \" Government of all the talents \" ( GOAT ) in which people who had not previously been members of the Labour Party but had expertise in specific areas would be appointed as ministers . Consequently , five new ministers , including Sir Ara Darzi — a consultant surgeon who became a health minister in the House of Lords , Sir Digby Jones — a former director general of the CBI who became minister of state for trade and investment and Sir Alan West — the former head of the Royal Navy who became a security minister at the Home Office .",
  "Lambertia formosa was one of the earliest introductions of Australian plant species to cultivation in England . In 1788 , seed was sent from Botany Bay to the Lee and Kennedy 's nursery in Hammersmith , west London . Two varieties were raised , one designated as \" var. longifolia \" . The first recorded flowering was a plant grown by J. Robertson of Stockwell in July 1798 . Andrews wrote the following year that it is \" without difficulty raised by cuttings , and thrives in peat earth . \" Knight reported in 1809 that it required more heat and close care than other Australian plants and hence would never be widely cultivated in England .",
  "Lawless scored against Championship team Derby County with a \" superb finish past Carroll from a tight angle \" after evading the opponent defence in an FA Cup third round tie on 3 January 2009 , which put Forest Green 2 – 0 up , although they went on to lose 4 – 3 . He missed Forest Green 's FA Trophy tie against Redditch United because of a hamstring injury , as well as the semi @-@ final of the Conference League Cup against Woking . He made his return in a 2 – 1 defeat to Eastbourne Borough on 17 January 2009 and was substituted in the 64th minute as a precaution . After missing the match against Histon because of a one @-@ match suspension , Lawless contributed with an assist and a goal on his return against Northwich on 18 February 2009 , after heading from a corner kick for John Hardiker to score and himself finishing with a goal from close range . He was forced to miss games against Cambridge United and Kidderminster in April due to a stomach illness , and he made his return in the 2009 Conference League Cup Final , which was lost 3 – 0 to AFC Telford United on a penalty shoot @-@ out , after a 0 – 0 extra time draw . His season ended prematurely after he suffered a broken leg against York City following a heavy challenge on 21 April 2009 , with an X @-@ ray confirming his fibula endured a hairline fracture . He completed the season with 39 appearances and six goals and Harvey hoped his budget would allow for Lawless to stay at the club .",
  "When Spring 's girlfriend , Lee Jones , is killed in \" Conversations with the Dead \" , the task of investigating the murder is handed to Chief Inspector Colin Devis of the London Metropolitan Police , \" one of the Department 's all @-@ time cretins \" . Devis ' pursuit of the killer , an agent of the British Secret Service , costs him his job but Spring compensates him by hiring him , at the rank of Inspector , for the ISPF . Although Devis is not the sharpest investigator , his heart is in the right place and he is fiercely loyal to Spring . Overweight , sexist and bigoted , five times married Devis is the series ' main comedy element and frequently gets the best lines .",
  "A new feature called MacroMaker was included with System 6 . When enabled , it allowed users to record mouse and keyboard input as \" macros . \" MacroMaker had a unique user interface , which aimed to look and act like a tape recorder . MacroMaker was criticized for its lack of features when compared to Microsoft 's AutoMac III , which was already available commercially . As MacroMaker only recorded the locations of mouse @-@ clicks inside windows and not what was being clicked or exactly when , users soon found that it could not be used to automate more sophisticated programs . The pre @-@ recorded clicks would miss buttons if they had moved or failed to appear upon playback . MacroMaker was not compatible with System 7 , which marked the introduction of AppleScript as an alternative .",
  "In December 1776 , after completing the conquest of New York City , British Lieutenant General William Howe detached a body of troops from his army which occupied Newport , Rhode Island without significant opposition . The Newport garrison came under the command of Brigadier General Sir Robert Pigot when the original commander , Brigadier General Richard Prescott , was captured in the summer of 1777 in a daring commando operation led by Continental Army Major and Warren , Rhode Island , native William Barton .",
  "For recording , the Doors hired Elvis Presley 's bassist Jerry Scheff and rhythm guitarist Marc Benno to round out their sound , with Scheff , in particular , contributing on every track except \" L 'America \" . Densmore characterized Scheff as \" an in @-@ the @-@ pocket man \" and praised how he \" allowed me to communicate rhythmically with Morrison , and he slowed Ray down , when his right hand on the keyboards got too darn fast \" . By all accounts , Morrison – a huge Presley fan – was excited by Scheff 's participation . In addition , Benno was asked to participate as a result of his recent notoriety from working with Leon Russell . The songs were completed in a few takes on a professional @-@ quality 8 @-@ channel recorder , and the album was finished in six days . Morrison was a blues enthusiast and proclaimed the final recording session as \" blues day \" , recording \" Crawling King Snake \" , \" Cars Hiss By My Window \" , and \" L.A. Woman \" . The album had a raw , live sound with overdubs mostly limited to additional keyboards . Botnick explained , \" The overall concept for the recording session was to go back to our early roots and try to get everything live in the studio with as few overdubs as possible \" . Mixing was completed at Poppy Studios between February and March 1971 , by which time Morrison had moved to Paris , France .",
  "In the years following publication , Benchley began to feel responsible for the negative attitudes against sharks that his novel engendered . He became an ardent ocean conservationist . In an article for the National Geographic published in 2000 , Benchley writes \" considering the knowledge accumulated about sharks in the last 25 years , I couldn 't possibly write Jaws today ... not in good conscience anyway . Back then , it was generally accepted that great whites were anthropophagus ( they ate people ) by choice . Now we know that almost every attack on a human is an accident : The shark mistakes the human for its normal prey . \" Upon his death in 2006 , Benchley 's widow Wendy declared the author \" kept telling people the book was fiction \" , and comparing Jaws to The Godfather , \" he took no more responsibility for the fear of sharks than Mario Puzo took responsibility for the Mafia . \"",
  "In the course of pin @-@ pointing the location of the tomb , the Reverend H.B. Hackett in Sir William Smith 's A dictionary of the Bible ( 1863 ) mentions the existence of two tombs bearing an association to Joseph in Nablus . In addition to the one close to the well , ( location of Conder 's survey ) , he describes another exclusively Muslim tomb in the vicinity , about a quarter of a mile up the valley on the slope of Mt . Gerizim . He is not able to conclude which of the tombs is that of the biblical Joseph , but cites Arthur Penrhyn Stanley ( 1856 ) that at the Muslim tomb \" a later Joseph is also commemorated at the sanctuary . \" Stanley himself writes that the little mosque on Gerizim 's north @-@ eastern slopes is known by various names including Allon Moreh ( Oak of Allon ) , Aharon Moreh ( Ark of Moreh ) and Sheykh al @-@ Amad ( Saint of the Pillar ) which he suggests commemorate biblcal traditions . Stanley also quotes Buckingham , who mentions that the Samaritans maintain that the alternative tomb belongs to a certain Rabbi Joseph of Nablus . John Mills ( 1864 ) writes that claims of the tomb belonging to Rabbi Joseph of Nablus are unfounded , the structure being called by the Samaritans \" The Pillar \" in commemoration of the pillar set up by Joshua . Mills rather identifies the supposed rabbi 's tomb with a mosque named after a Muslim saint , Sheikh el @-@ Amud ( \" Saint of the Pillar \" ) , but further claims that the association is ' only a modern invention of the Mohammedans ' . A book published in 1894 , also questions the existence of a tomb to Rabbi Joseph of Nablus , calling it ' a Mohammedan legend , imposed upon inquisitive travellers by unscrupulous guides ' since ' the present Samaritans known of no Joseph 's tomb but the generally accepted one ' .",
  "The title of the film was chosen to counter American author Katherine Mayo 's 1927 polemical book Mother India , which vilified Indian culture . Allusions to Hindu mythology are abundant in the film , and its lead character has been seen as a metonymic representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept of what it means to be a mother to society through self @-@ sacrifice . Mother India metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of independence , and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation @-@ building . While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment , others see her cast in female stereotypes . The Oedipal elements between Radha and her son Birju have also been discussed by authors . The film was shot in Mumbai 's Mehboob Studios and in the villages of Maharashtra , Gujarat , and Uttar Pradesh states . The music by Naushad introduced Western classical music and Hollywood @-@ style orchestra to Hindi cinema .",
  "In another project , the village of La Vang in Quảng Trị Province near the border with North Vietnam , was the scene of a female apparition in the late 19th century . Buddhists claimed that the bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara ( also known as Kuanyin ; Vietnamese : Quan Âm ) performed the miracle . Diệm 's brother , Ngô Đình Thục , was the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Huế and the foremost religious figure in South Vietnam 's nepotistic regime . Thục declared that the apparition was the Virgin Mary , and ordered that a cathedral be built in place of the makeshift Buddhist pagoda that occupied the site . Thơ made notable financial donations to the project for political reasons .",
  "Aside from the best represented styles of architecture listed above , Old Louisville also has several great examples of the Chateauesque style of architecture in select buildings throughout the area . For example , one of these examples is a residential building , a mansion , at 400 Belgravia Court , which is a \" walking court \" where the mansions face a park like walk rather than a street . This specific building was completed in 1897 and one of its first residents was William H. Wathen , M.D. , an eminent medical educator in Louisville from a family of successful distillers .",
  "Stossel has criticized government programs for being inefficient , wasteful , and harmful . He has also criticized the American legal system , opining that it provides lawyers and vexatious litigators the incentive to file frivolous lawsuits indiscriminately . Stossel contends that these suits often generate more wealth for lawyers than for deserving clients , stifle innovation and personal freedoms , and cause harm to private citizens , taxpayers , consumers and businesses . Although Stossel concedes that some lawsuits are necessary in order to provide justice to people genuinely injured by others with greater economic power , he advocates the adoption in the U.S. of the English rule as one method to reduce the more abusive or frivolous lawsuits .",
  "While Schmidt said before the game 's release that the team wanted to develop \" a whole series of games that take place in the Terra Nova world \" , the game 's poor sales made the creation of a sequel \" impractical \" , according to Paul Neurath . As the game 's publisher , Looking Glass took on the full burden of its commercial underperformance , which contributed to the company 's bankruptcy and closure in May 2000 . Neurath later said , \" If we could do Terra Nova over , I would have dumped the cinematics and done online team play instead . Who knows , maybe then the Tribes II and Halo teams would be talking about the influence of Terra Nova on their games \" .",
  "The French Navy provided full use of the frigate FS La Fayette and their newest helicopter , the Eurocopter Tiger to the film 's production team . The French government also allowed the use of Navy logos as part of the promotional campaign for the film .

  "Following his experience with the German hospital staff , Xhinovci realized that he could capitalize on his resemblance to Hitler . He went to great lengths to enhance his physical likeness to the Nazi leader — regularly clipping his moustache , dying his hair jet black and imitating Hitler 's signature hairstyle . When the war in Kosovo ended , Xhinovci returned to Mitrovica and opened a bar called Bar Hit and Jet , known affectionately among Kosovo Albanians as Pizzeria Hitleri ( \" Hitler 's Pizzeria \" ) . The establishment proved controversial among western peacekeepers who had occupied Kosovo following the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces in June 1999 . In one instance , French NATO troops took down a sign carrying a swastika from the entrance to Xhinovci 's bar , much to his displeasure . One French commander told reporters that he was disgusted with Xhinovci 's actions and said that his troops were forbidden from entering the bar , which juxtaposed Nazi imagery with portraits of Xhinovci in KLA uniform . Asked why he enjoyed dressing up as Hitler , Xhinovci responded : \" Everyone who is against the people who carried out bloodshed against [ Albanians ] is a friend of mine \" , apparently referring to the German @-@ led Axis occupation of Yugoslavia , when German forces turned a blind eye to Albanian raids on Serb @-@ populated areas of Kosovo . He conceded that Hitler had gone \" too far \" by killing women and children , but said that it would be \" a good idea to eliminate all those who thirst for our blood \" .",

  "Ash accumulation will also affect pasture , plants and trees which are part of the horticulture and agriculture industries . Thin ash falls ( < 20 mm ) may put livestock off eating , and can inhibit transpiration and photosynthesis and alter growth . There may be an increase in pasture production due to a mulching effect and slight fertilizing effect , such as occurred following the 1980 Mount St. Helens and 1995 / 96 Mt Ruapehu eruptions . Heavier falls will completely bury pastures and soil leading to death of pasture and sterilization of the soil due to oxygen deprivation . Plant survival is dependent on ash thickness , ash chemistry , compaction of ash , amount of rainfall , duration of burial and the length of plant stalks at the time of ash fall . The acidic nature of ash will lead to elevated soil sulfur levels and lowered soil pH , which can reduce the availability of essential minerals and alter the soil ’ s characteristics so that crops and plants will not survive . Ash will also impact upon arable crops , such as fruit , vegetables and grain . Ash can burn plant and crop tissue reducing quality , contaminate crops during harvest and damage plants from ash loading .",
  "In this formalism , a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum ; molecular details are entirely ignored . Rather , this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample . The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the Frank free energy density . One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample : ( 1 ) twists of the material , where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another , rather than aligned ; ( 2 ) splay of the material , where bending occurs perpendicular to the director ; and ( 3 ) bend of the material , where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis . All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty . They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container . The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions . Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices and lipid bilayers .",
  "There have been several theories proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease that resulted in the failure of so many vineyards , most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect , and the way it attacks the roots . The proboscis of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a feeding tube through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients . As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine , the sap pressure falls and , as a result , the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food . Thus , anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find Phylloxera clinging to the roots of the plant .",

  "Ship design was not yet a science , but was an empirical process based on experience rather than calculation . Balancing the military need for firepower against the maritime need for seaworthiness resulted in some compromises that would not pass modern standards for stability . A ship with two gundecks was an even more demanding proposition , as the lower tier of gunports had to be uncomfortably close to the water , and there was an unavoidably large amount of weight being carried above the waterline . One of the solutions which became common was graduated armament , in which the guns of the upper decks were progressively lighter . Such an armament , with 24 @-@ pounders on the lower gundeck and 12 @-@ pounders on the upper gundeck , was considered for Vasa in 1627 , but eventually the armament plan reverted to the king 's original desire of 24 @-@ pounders on both decks .

  "Grand Teton National Park is the only U.S. National Park that permits hunting , but only of elk in an effort to keep the populations of that species regulated . This provision was included in the legislation that combined Jackson Hole National Monument and Grand Teton National Park in 1950 .

  "Livestock depredation has been one of the primary reasons for hunting wolves , and can pose a severe problem for wolf conservation : as well as causing economic losses , the threat of wolf predation causes great stress on livestock producers , and no foolproof solution of preventing such attacks short of exterminating wolves has been found . Some nations help offset economic losses to wolves through compensation programmes or state insurance . Domesticated animals are easy prey for wolves , as they have evolved under constant human protection , and are thus unable to defend themselves very well . Wolves typically resort to attacking livestock when wild prey is depleted : in Eurasia , a large part of the diet of some wolf populations consists of livestock , while such incidences are rare in North America , where healthy populations of wild prey have been largely restored . The majority of losses occur during the summer grazing period , with untended livestock in remote pastures being the most vulnerable to wolf predation . The most frequently targeted livestock species are sheep ( Europe ) , domestic reindeer ( northern Scandinavia ) , goats ( India ) , horses ( Mongolia ) , cattle and turkeys ( North America ) . The number of animals killed in single attacks varies according to species : most attacks on cattle and horses result in one death , while turkeys , sheep and domestic reindeer may be killed in surplus . Wolves mainly attack livestock when the animals are grazing , though they occasionally break into fenced enclosures . In some cases , wolves do not need to physically attack livestock to negatively affect it : the stress livestock experiences in being vigilant for wolves may result in miscarriages , weight loss and a decrease in meat quality .",

  "Feathers being critical to the survival of a bird , require maintenance . Apart from physical wear and tear , feathers face the onslaught of fungi , ectoparasitic feather mites and birdlice . The physical condition of feathers are maintained by preening often with the application of secretions from the preen gland . Birds also bathe in water or dust themselves .

Birds of arid regions make use of loose soil to dust @-@ bathe . A behaviour termed as anting in which the bird encourages ants to run through their plumage is also thought to help them reduce the ectoparasite load in feathers .

Females with young have the responsibility to watch out for their young and other relatives near the burrow , and therefore voice the trill more often than other Olympic marmots . If marmots are not accustomed to human contact in a certain area , they may also sound a trill when seeing a person , in order to alert other marmots . At places like Hurricane Ridge , where seeing humans is a frequent occurrence , most marmots will not acknowledge human presence at all .",

  "The main disadvantage to die casting is the very high capital cost . Both the casting equipment required and the dies and related components are very costly , as compared to most other casting processes . Therefore , to make die casting an economic process , a large production volume is needed . Other disadvantages are that the process is limited to high @-@ fluidity metals , and casting weights must be between 30 grams ( 1 oz ) and 10 kg ( 20 lb ) . In the standard die casting process the final casting will have a small amount of porosity . This prevents any heat treating or welding , because the heat causes the gas in the pores to expand , which causes micro @-@ cracks inside the part and exfoliation of the surface . Thus a related disadvantage of die casting is that it is only for parts in which softness is acceptable . Parts needing hardening ( through hardening or case hardening ) and tempering are not cast in dies .",

  "Whorf 's study of Hopi time has been the most widely discussed and criticized example of linguistic relativity . In his analysis he argues that there is a relation between how the Hopi people conceptualize time , how they speak of temporal relations , and the grammar of the Hopi language . Whorf 's most elaborate argument for the existence of linguistic relativity was based on what he saw as a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi . He argued that the Hopi language , in contrast to English and other SAE languages , does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct countable instances , like \" three days \" or \" five years \" , but rather as a single process . Because of this difference , the language lacks nouns that refer to units of time . He proposed that the Hopi view of time was fundamental in all aspects of their culture and furthermore explained certain patterns of behavior . In his 1939 memorial essay to Sapir he wrote that “ ... the Hopi language is seen to contain no words , grammatical forms , construction or expressions that refer directly to what we call ' time ' , or to past , present , or future ... ”",

  "The second possibility is that Quistclose trusts are express trusts . If the contract included a provision that the money was to only be used for certain purposes , it could be interpreted that this money is held on trust until it is used for those purposes . The borrower would be a trustee ; using the money for any other purpose would be in violation of the trustee 's duties , and so void .

Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi , another video display processor was incorporated into the system 's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony 's forthcoming PlayStation . The Saturn was initially successful in Japan , but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch , four months before its scheduled release date . After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996 , the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S. , where it was discontinued in 1998 . Having sold 9 @.@ 26 million units worldwide , the Saturn is considered a commercial failure . The failure of Sega 's development teams to release a game in the Sonic the Hedgehog series , known in development as Sonic X @-@ treme , has been considered a factor in the console 's poor performance .",

Foreign influences include Mozart , Schubert , Liszt and Chopin . He considered himself in many ways a classicist , often using traditional structures and forms , such as the ternary , to present his new melodic and rhythmic content and innovative harmonies . The influence of jazz on his later music is heard within conventional classical structures in the Piano Concerto and the Violin Sonata .",

  "The early 19th century has been seen as a time of decline for the society ; of 662 fellows in 1830 , only 104 had contributed to the Philosophical Transactions . The same year , Charles Babbage published Reflections on the Decline of Science in England , and on Some of Its Causes , which was deeply critical of the Society . The scientific Fellows of the Society were spurred into action by this , and eventually James South established a Charters Committee \" with a view to obtaining a supplementary Charter from the Crown \" , aimed primarily at looking at ways to restrict membership . The Committee recommended that the election of Fellows take place on one day every year , that the Fellows be selected on consideration of their scientific achievements and that the number of fellows elected a year be limited to 15 . This limit was increased to 17 in 1930 and 20 in 1937 ; it is currently 52 . This had a number of effects on the Society : first , the Society 's membership became almost entirely scientific , with few political Fellows or patrons . Second , the number of Fellows was significantly reduced — between 1700 and 1850 , the number of Fellows rose from approximately 100 to approximately 750 . From then until 1941 , the total number of Fellows was always between 400 and 500 .",

  "The question of computing the homotopy group πn + k ( Sn ) for positive k turned out to be a central question in algebraic topology that has contributed to development of many of its fundamental techniques and has served as a stimulating focus of research .

These are called the stable homotopy groups of spheres and have been computed for values of k up to 64 . The stable homotopy groups form the coefficient ring of an extraordinary cohomology theory , called stable cohomotopy theory .

  "In 1794 , a basin was built above Framilode lock , so that vessels could wait there until the tide in the Severn was at a suitable level . This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company , but requests for a horse towing path in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive . They eventually provided one after the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal had been built , and the canal was the only part of the waterway from Shrewsbury on the Severn to Teddington on the Thames that did not have one . It was completed in August 1827 . The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul , and the levels were adjusted by building a new lock on the Stroudwater below the junction , to ensure neither company lost water to the other . The new company paid for its construction . > After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to Sharpness in 1827 , the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less , although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route .",

  "Liverpool 's rivalry with Manchester United is viewed as a manifestation of the cities ' competition during the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century .

  "William Wellman 's The Public Enemy was released by Warner Brothers the following year and features another career defining performance , this time by James Cagney . It was adapted from the unpublished novelette Beer and Blood written by John Bright , and adapted for the screen by Kubec Glasmon and Bright . Enemy takes place from 1909 until 1920 . The film is similar to the template set in Caesar in that it follows Tom Powers ( Cagney ) from his rise to his eventual fall in the world of crime . Cagney 's character contrasts his puritanical brother who wants him to go straight and their mother , who is at the center of the conflict between her two sons . Tom Powers is egotistical , amoral , heartless , and extremely violent . The most famous scene in the picture is referred to as the \" grapefruit scene \" ; when Cagney is eating breakfast , his girlfriend angers him , so he cruelly shoves half of a grapefruit in her face . The scene became so famous that for the rest of his life when Cagney dined at a restaurant , other patrons would send his table a grapefruit . Cagney was even more violent towards women in his 1933 gangster film Picture Snatcher , where he knocks out an amorous woman he is not interested in and violently throws her into the back seat of his car . Enemy was based in part on the Irish gangster Dean O 'Banion , and a scene in which Cagney kills a horse that caused the death of a friend was inspired by a similar real life event where O 'Banion underling Louis \" Two Guns \" Alterie and others shot a horse . The film 's trailer featured no scenes from the movie ; it merely contained a warning of the picture 's intensity and showcased a gun being fired at the camera . Zanuck also produced Enemy , and was heavily involved in the film 's production . He aimed for a movie where the characters were not just immoral , but free of morals , and devoid of conscience . When he showed the film to MGM 's Irving Thalberg , Thalberg remarked \" that 's not a motion picture . It 's beyond a motion picture . \" While Wingate conceded that the film \" was a story that needed to be told \" , other states were less convinced . Maryland and Ohio cut the grapefruit scene .

The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters , distinguishing between those that carry no information about shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups ( homoplasies ) or those left over from ancestors ( plesiomorphies ) – and derived characters , which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor ( apomorphies ) .

  "Some legal scholars , opposed to the idea that jus soli should apply to the children of illegal aliens , have argued that the Wong Kim Ark precedent does not apply when alien parents are in the country illegally . John C.

Eastman further argues that the Wong Kim Ark decision was fundamentally flawed in the way it dealt with the concept of jurisdiction , and that the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 — which followed Wong Kim Ark — would not have been necessary if Congress had believed \" that the Citizenship Clause confers citizenship merely by accident of birth . \" A similar analysis of the jurisdiction question has been proposed by Professor Peter H.

According to law professor Lino Graglia of the University of Texas , even if Wong Kim Ark settled the status of children of legal residents , it did not do so for children of illegal residents ; Graglia asserts that the case weighs against automatic birthright for illegal immigrants because the Court denied such citizenship for an analogous group , namely \" children of alien enemies , born during and within their hostile occupation \" .

  "Along with New York Dolls , Too Much Too Soon became one of the most popular cult albums in rock music . According to AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine , the group predated punk rock with their \" gleeful sleaziness and reckless sound \" on the record , which he said was embellished by Morton 's production details and exemplified by \" musically visceral and dangerous \" songs such as \" Human Being \" . In 1986 , Sounds magazine ranked it sixtieth on its list of the 100 best albums of all time . After it was reissued by Mercury in 1987 , Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times wrote that Morton 's production highlighted the New York Dolls ' sense of humor and was rendered vividly by the CD remaster .

  "Chinese Muslim traders from the eastern coast of China arrived at the coastal towns of Indonesia and Malaysia in the early 15th century . They were led by the mariner Zheng He , who commanded several expeditions to southeastern Asia between 1405 and 1430 . In the book Yingya Shenglan , his translator Ma Huan documented the activities of the Chinese Muslims in the archipelago and the legacy left by Zheng He and his men . These traders settled along the northern coast of Java , but there is no documentation of their settlements beyond the 16th century . The Chinese Muslims were likely to have been absorbed into the majority Muslim population . Between 1450 and 1520 , the Ming Dynasty 's interest in southeastern Asia reached a low point and trade , both legal and illegal , rarely reached the archipelago . The Portuguese made no mention of any resident Chinese minority population when they arrived in Indonesia in the early 16th century . Trade from the north was re @-@ established when China legalized private trade in 1567 through licensing 50 junks a year .

Andrew P.

He concludes that the C5 was poorly defined , appearing to be \" trying to grasp at two different markets \" but was unable to appeal to either , and so failed to take off . The fact that it was initially only available via mail order was also a mistake , in Marks ' view , as it meant that no physical inspection of the product could be made before purchasing it . This was a serious deterrent to consumers as it made the C5 a much more risky purchase .",

  "The results of special relativity can be summarized by treating space and time as a unified structure known as spacetime ( with c relating the units of space and time ) , and requiring that physical theories satisfy a special symmetry called Lorentz invariance , whose mathematical formulation contains the parameter c . Lorentz invariance is an almost universal assumption for modern physical theories , such as quantum electrodynamics , quantum chromodynamics , the Standard Model of particle physics , and general relativity . As such , the parameter c is ubiquitous in modern physics , appearing in many contexts that are unrelated to light . For example , general relativity predicts that c is also the speed of gravity and of gravitational waves . In non @-@ inertial frames of reference ( gravitationally curved spacetime or accelerated reference frames ) , the local speed of light is constant and equal to c , but the speed of light along a trajectory of finite length can differ from c , depending on how distances and times are defined .",

  "During its early stages , Francelia brought gusty winds and light rainfall to several islands in the Caribbean Sea . While remaining nearly stationary offshore Central America , heavy precipitation fell in some countries , especially Guatemala where severe flooding killed 269 people and caused $ 15 million in damage . In neighboring Honduras , the hurricane struck after the undeclared Football War , causing additional damage in the northern portions of the country . Damage in Honduras was heaviest on the offshore Bay Islands , and the hurricane damaged or destroyed the majority of two towns there . In El Salvador , flooding isolated towns for several days and caused crop damage . Several rivers in the region flooded , with the Belize River reaching 36 feet ( 11 m ) above normal . Coastal areas of Belize lost electricity and telephone service , and high winds resulted in extensive damage to banana crops .

  "A game is played between two teams , each composed of nine players , that take turns playing offense ( batting and baserunning ) and defense ( pitching and fielding ) . A pair of turns , one at bat and one in the field , by each team constitutes an inning . A game consists of nine innings ( seven innings at the high school level and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues ) . One team — customarily the visiting team — bats in the top , or first half , of every inning . The other team — customarily the home team — bats in the bottom , or second half , of every inning . The goal of the game is to score more points ( runs ) than the other team . The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the square @-@ shaped baseball diamond . A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base , second base , third base , and back home in order to score a run . The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record outs , which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team 's batting order comes up again . When three outs are recorded , the teams switch roles for the next half @-@ inning . If the score of the game is tied after nine innings , extra innings are played to resolve the contest .

  "Almost no Mercian coins are known from the 830s , after Wiglaf regained Mercia from Egbert of Wessex . Beorhtwulf restarted a Mercian coinage early in his reign , and the extended gap in the 830s has led to the suggestion that Wiglaf 's second reign was as a client king of Egbert 's , without permission to mint his own coinage . Beorhtwulf 's coinage would then indicate his independence of Mercia . However , it is more usually thought that Wiglaf took Mercia back by force . An alternative explanation for Beorhtwulf 's revival of the coinage is that it was part of a plan for economic regeneration in the face of the Viking attacks . The Viking threat may also account for the evident cooperation in matters of currency between Mercia and Wessex which began in Beorhtwulf 's reign and lasted until the end of the independent Mercian kingdom on the death of King Ceolwulf II in the years around 880 .",

  "The important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis . Molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies , such as the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication Molecular Ecology in 1992 . Molecular ecology uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context . In 1994 , John Avise also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book , Molecular Markers , Natural History and Evolution . Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint , such as bacteria , fungi , and nematodes . Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable . Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology . For example , molecular ecology revealed promiscuous sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in tree swallows previously thought to be socially monogamous . In a biogeographical context , the marriage between genetics , ecology , and evolution resulted in a new sub @-@ discipline called phylogeography .",

Among his colleagues was the future philosopher Grigore Sturdza , son of the Moldavian monarch . His stay in Lunéville was cut short by the intervention of Russian officials , who were supervising Moldavia under the provisions of the Regulamentul Organic regime , and who believed that , through the influence of Lhommé ( a participant in the French Revolution ) , students were being infused with rebellious ideas ; all Moldavian students , including Sturdza 's sons and other noblemen , were withdrawn from the school in late 1835 , and reassigned to Prussian education institutions .",
  "Holliday junctions may exist in a variety of conformational isomers with different patterns of coaxial stacking between the four double @-@ helical arms . Coaxial stacking is the tendency of nucleic acid blunt ends to bind to each other , by interactions between the exposed bases . There are three possible stacking conformers : an unstacked form and two stacked forms . The unstacked form dominates in the absence of divalent cations such as Mg2 + , because of electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged backbones of the strands . In the presence of at least about 0 @.@ 1 mM Mg2 + , the electrostatic repulsion is counteracted and the stacked structures predominate . As of 2000 , it was not known with certainty whether the electrostatic shielding was the result of site @-@ specific binding of cations to the junction , or the presence of a diffuse collection of the ions in solution .",
  "Although buyout firms generally had different aims and methods , they were often lumped in with the \" corporate raiders \" who came on the scene in the 1980s .

By contrast , private equity firms generally attempted to strike deals with boards and CEOs , though in many cases in the 1980s they allied with managements that were already under pressure from raiders . But both groups bought companies through leveraged buyouts ; both relied heavily on junk bond financing ; and under both types of owners in many cases major assets were sold , costs were slashed and employees were laid off . Hence , in the public mind , they were lumped together .",

  "Phosphorylation is a chemical reaction in which a small phosphate group is added to another molecule to change that molecule 's activity . Autonomously active CaMKII and PKC use phosphorylation to carry out the two major mechanisms underlying the expression of E @-@ LTP . First , and most importantly , they phosphorylate existing AMPA receptors to increase their activity . Second , they mediate or modulate the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane . Importantly , the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse during E @-@ LTP is independent of protein synthesis . This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane . When the appropriate LTP @-@ inducing stimulus arrives , nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the postsynaptic membrane under the influence of protein kinases . As mentioned previously , AMPA receptors are the brain 's most abundant glutamate receptors and mediate the majority of its excitatory activity . By increasing the efficiency and number of AMPA receptors at the synapse , future excitatory stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses .",

  "To create the original label for THB , Star Breweries opted to copy an existing label for a Dutch beer brand called The Holland Beer , which featured the image of three horses . This was done in part because of the association between Antsirabe and its history of horse breeding ; the brand took the name Three Horses Beer based on this design . The label also features the brand 's slogan , Soa Ny Fiarahantsika ( \" The Pleasure of Being Together \" ) . The labels were originally printed in the Netherlands and shipped to Madagascar before eventually being produced on the local market ; THB coasters continue to be produced in Europe . The bottle color and shape and its label have undergone adjustments over time . In 2005 , the label was enlarged and the colors brightened . The band around the neck of the bottle was also broadened with the addition of the image of a medal , in honor of the beer 's first international award in 2004 .

  "Maple sugaring parties typically began to operate at the start of the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples . Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks , usually more than one hole per large tree ; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap . The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment 's core from one end of the cylinder , creating a seamless , watertight container . Sap filled the buckets , and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels ( barrels , large pots , or hollowed @-@ out wooden logs ) , often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals , or carried in buckets or other convenient containers . The sap @-@ collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted on the trees , and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained \" sweet \" . The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were , and still are , critical in determining the length of the sugaring season . As the weather continues to warm , a maple tree 's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap , making it unpalatable , perhaps due to an increase in amino acids .",

In October and November 1831 the queen enacted a ban on Christian marriages , church services and baptisms for soldiers and members of government studying in the Missionary schools , and in December extended the ban on church service attendance to all Malagasy .

In 1835 , the queen attempted to shut down the press without directly targeting the LMS by banning Malagasy personnel from working at the printing house .

  "Thomas Brassey was educated at home until the age of 12 , when he was sent to The King 's School in Chester . Aged 16 , he became an articled apprentice to a land surveyor and agent , William Lawton . Lawton was the agent of Francis Richard Price of Overton , Flintshire . During the time Brassey was an apprentice he helped to survey the new Shrewsbury to Holyhead road ( this is now the A5 ) , assisting the surveyor of the road . While he was engaged in this work he met the engineer for the road , Thomas Telford . When his apprenticeship ended at the age of 21 , Brassey was taken into partnership by Lawton , forming the firm of \" Lawton and Brassey \" . Brassey moved to Birkenhead where their business was established . Birkenhead at that time was a very small place ; in 1818 it consisted of only four houses . The business flourished and grew , extending into areas beyond land surveying . At the Birkenhead site a brickworks and lime kilns were built . The business either owned or managed sand and stone quarries in Wirral . Amongst other ventures , the firm supplied the bricks for building the custom house for the port which was developing in the town . Many of the bricks needed for the growing city of Liverpool were supplied by the brickworks and Brassey devised new methods of transporting his materials , including a system similar to the modern method of palletting , and using a gravity train to take materials from the quarry to the port . When Lawton died , Brassey became sole manager of the company and sole agent and representative for Francis Price . It was during these years that he gained the basic experience for his future career .",

  "The Soviet Union covered over one sixth of the entire earth 's landmass , and in the early 1920s its government decided to invest in the aviation industry . They concluded that expanding it in the Soviet Union would not only make travel more efficient and faster , it would also help build and develop the mostly farmland , enormously spread out nation that it was . At this time , most travel required taking trains ( or , as was often the case , by off road travel in cars , buses or trucks ) . Many of the northern and eastern territories in the Soviet Union were completely inaccessible during much of the year ; most of these vast expanses of land lacked roads and railroads because of the huge distances between them and the nearest population centers . The practically uninhabitable weather also made travel and construction nearly impossible . The absence of \" surface transportation facilities \" also meant that very little equipment was available to use for road construction — making the process even more daunting . Consequently , the Soviet government , always eager to save money in the transportation sector , concluded that building a series of airports scattered throughout the more desolate and isolated parts of the country would be far more economically efficient to than to build thousands of miles of roads ( and / or railroads ) for automobile / train travel . Air travel would be the best means of transportation for people and cargo . First , a fleet was necessary ; between 1928 and 1932 , the number of aircraft manufacturing facilities grew from twelve to thirty @-@ one , while the nation 's annual output of airplanes increased from a mere 608 to 2 @,@ 509 .

  "A study of coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B. aemula grew on ridges ( dry heath ) and B. oblongifolia on slopes ( wet heath ) , and the two species did not overlap . Manipulation of seedlings in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath , but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath . Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia , the two species did not appear to impact negatively on each other . A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate was low , and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths . Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination , and that they can germinate in the presence or absence of recent bushfire .

He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The plot was likened by Walton of The Moving Picture News to Enoch Arden , but the story differs in several ways . Published by Alfred , Lord Tennyson in 1864 , the poem tells of the eponymous character who becomes shipwrecked on a desert island and returns home a decade later to find his wife has remarried and they have a new child . For the sake of his wife 's happiness , he never lets her know that he is alive . The plot differs because the husband willingly fakes his death and returns on the day of the wedding . Rather than announce himself , he attempts to leave and dies in the process , his body is removed by the prospective husband before marrying her . The similarity with the poem comes from refusing to confront or interrupt the wedding by revealing the fact that he is alive is ensured by John 's true death at the climax . The New York Dramatic Mirror noted that the journalists arrived to photograph and cover the apparent suicide too quickly , making it illogical that the fake suicide would not have been revealed .",

  "In 1859 , the French mathematician and astronomer Urbain Le Verrier reported that the slow precession of Mercury 's orbit around the Sun could not be completely explained by Newtonian mechanics and perturbations by the known planets . He suggested , among possible explanations , that another planet ( or perhaps instead a series of smaller ' corpuscules ' ) might exist in an orbit even closer to the Sun than that of Mercury , to account for this perturbation . ( Other explanations considered included a slight oblateness of the Sun . ) The success of the search for Neptune based on its perturbations of the orbit of Uranus led astronomers to place faith in this possible explanation , and the hypothetical planet was named Vulcan , but no such planet was ever found .",

  "Up to the 1950s , the predominant method in deaf education was oralism – acquiring oral language comprehension and production . Linguists did not consider sign language to be true \" language \" , but rather something inferior . Recognition of the legitimacy of ASL was achieved by William Stokoe , a linguist who arrived at Gallaudet University in 1955 when this was still the dominant assumption . Aided by the civil rights movement of the 1960s , Stokoe argued for manualism , the use of sign language in deaf education . Stokoe noted that sign language shares the important features that oral languages have as a means of communication , and even devised a transcription system for ASL . In doing so , Stokoe revolutionized both deaf education and linguistics . In the 1960s , ASL was sometimes referred to as \" Ameslan \" , but this term is now considered obsolete .",

The case involved two accused persons who were convicted under the Sedition Act and the Undesirable Publications Act for distributing religious literature that was considered seditious and objectionable to Muslims .

GameSpy 's reviewer Jamie Madigan stated that \" what really pulls the game down is the ' more of the same ' factor \" .

Madigan described the single @-@ player campaign as \" decent \" and commented that the High Definition pack made the game \" worthy of consideration \" . Eurogamer echoed criticism on the game 's length ; reviewer Tom Bradwell commented that \" although I 'm hard pressed to criticize what you get , the complete absence of everything we 've learnt from the likes of Counter @-@ Strike and everything since is frankly bizarre \" . Bradwell did , however , criticize the game 's artificial intelligence and the occasional bug that caused a player to get stuck on a wall . PC Zone 's Mark Hill was more lenient in his comments , praising the game 's artificial intelligence as \" intelligent as you could hope an AI enemy to be \" . In addition , Hill praised the game for showing more activity in the base , noting that \" a whole world goes on around you , with people eating at a cantina and scientists doing their laundry . The complex is more alive than ever before \" . Hill also praised the focus \" on a greater interaction with scientists as proper people rather than the two or three models that were cloned throughout the facility who kept repeating the same phrases \" , describing this as Blue Shift 's \" greatest achievement \" . PC Zone 's review closed by commenting that \" as a Dreamcast extra it works perfectly , but as a standalone PC title there 's not nearly enough to it . \"",

  "The High Seas Fleet ( Hochseeflotte ) was the battle fleet of the German Imperial Navy and saw action during the First World War . The formation was created in February 1907 , when the Home Fleet ( Heimatflotte ) was renamed as the High Seas Fleet . Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz was the architect of the fleet ; he envisioned a force powerful enough to challenge the Royal Navy 's predominance . Kaiser Wilhelm II , the German Emperor , championed the fleet as the instrument by which he would seize overseas possessions and make Germany a global power . By concentrating a powerful battle fleet in the North Sea while the Royal Navy was required to disperse its forces around the British Empire , Tirpitz believed Germany could achieve a balance of force that could seriously damage British naval hegemony . This was the heart of Tirpitz 's \" Risk Theory , \" which held that Britain would not challenge Germany if the latter 's fleet posed such a significant threat to its own .",

In April 1866 , shortly after Domnitor Cuza was toppled by a coup d 'état , and just before Carol I was selected to replace him , the Romanian Army intervened to quell a separatist riot in Iași , instigated by Moldavian Metropolitan Calinic Miclescu . It is likely that Creangă shared the outlook of his fellow Fracțiunea members , according to which secession was preferable to Carol 's rule , and was probably among the rioters . At around the same time , the priest also began circulating antisemitic tracts , and is said to have demanded that Christians boycott Jewish business .

  "From 825 control of Kent fell to the kings of Wessex , and a compromise was reached between Archbishop Ceolnoth and King Egbert in 838 , confirmed by his son Æthelwulf in 839 , recognising Egbert and Æthelwulf as lay lords and protectors of monasteries and reserving spiritual lordship , particularly over election of abbots and abbesses , to bishops . One copy of the record of this agreement was preserved either at Reculver or at Lyminge .

  "The emerging discipline of geology also brought natural history and natural philosophy closer together ; the establishment of the stratigraphic column linked the spatial distribution of organisms to their temporal distribution , a key precursor to concepts of evolution . Georges Cuvier and others made great strides in comparative anatomy and paleontology in the late 1790s and early 19th century . In a series of lectures and papers that made detailed comparisons between living mammals and fossil remains Cuvier was able to establish that the fossils were remains of species that had become extinct — rather than being remains of species still alive elsewhere in the world , as had been widely believed . Fossils discovered and described by Gideon Mantell , William Buckland , Mary Anning , and Richard Owen among others helped establish that there had been an ' age of reptiles ' that had preceded even the prehistoric mammals . These discoveries captured the public imagination and focused attention on the history of life on earth . Most of these geologists held to catastrophism , but Charles Lyell 's influential Principles of Geology ( 1830 ) popularised Hutton 's uniformitarianism , a theory that explained the geological past and present on equal terms .",

The effect on the strategic situation in the Mediterranean was immediate , reversing the balance of the conflict and giving the British control at sea that they maintained for the remainder of the war . The destruction of the French Mediterranean fleet allowed the Royal Navy to return to the sea in force , as British squadrons set up blockades off French and allied ports . In particular , British ships cut Malta off from France , aided by the rebellion among the native Maltese population that forced the French garrison to retreat to Valletta and shut the gates . The ensuing Siege of Malta lasted for two years before the defenders were finally starved into surrender . In 1799 , British ships harassed Bonaparte 's army as it marched east and north through Palestine , and played a crucial part in Bonaparte 's defeat at the Siege of Acre , when the barges carrying the siege train were captured and the French storming parties were bombarded by British ships anchored offshore . It was during one of these latter engagements that Captain Miller of Theseus was killed in an ammunition explosion . The defeat at Acre forced Bonaparte to retreat to Egypt and effectively ended his efforts to carve an empire in the Middle East .

  "At the time Allah jang Palsoe was written , stage performances were heavily influenced by orality . Contemporary theatres , such as bangsawan and stamboel , were unscripted and generally used fantastic settings and plotlines . Kwee Tek Hoay heavily disapproved of such whimsy , considering it \" better to say things as they are , than to create events out of nothing , which although perhaps more entertaining and satisfying to viewers or readers , are falsehoods and lies , going against the truth \" . After condemning contemporary playwrights who merely wrote down existing stories , Kwee Tek Hoay expressed the hope that ultimately a unique form of Chinese Malay theatre — inspired by European theatrical traditions but dealing with Chinese themes — could be developed . Allah jang Palsoe was intended to be the first published stage play in this new tradition .",

From then on , she would write of her \" neighbors , the people [ she ] saw , the poverty that the women had gone through . \"",

  "Lichens are a symbiotic relationship between fungi and algae or cyanobacteria . The algae partner in the relationship is referred to in lichen terminology as a \" photobiont \" . The fungi part of the relationship are composed mostly of various species of ascomycetes and a few basidiomycetes . Lichens occur in every ecosystem on all continents , play a key role in soil formation and the initiation of biological succession , and are the dominating life forms in extreme environments , including polar , alpine , and semiarid desert regions . They are able to grow on inhospitable surfaces , including bare soil , rocks , tree bark , wood , shells , barnacles and leaves . As in mycorrhizas , the photobiont provides sugars and other carbohydrates via photosynthesis to the fungus , while the fungus provides minerals and water to the photobiont . The functions of both symbiotic organisms are so closely intertwined that they function almost as a single organism ; in most cases the resulting organism differs greatly from the individual components . Lichenization is a common mode of nutrition for fungi ; around 20 % of fungi — between 17 @,@ 500 and 20 @,@ 000 described species — are lichenized . Characteristics common to most lichens include obtaining organic carbon by photosynthesis , slow growth , small size , long life , long @-@ lasting ( seasonal ) vegetative reproductive structures , mineral nutrition obtained largely from airborne sources , and greater tolerance of desiccation than most other photosynthetic organisms in the same habitat .",

  "Mongolia 's central geographical position on the Asian continent was an important reason why it was able to play such a large role in the trade system . The Mongol army was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the empire . The military ensured that supply lines and trade routes flowed smoothly ; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travelers on these routes . Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire . A system of weights @-@ and @-@ measures was also standardized . To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing , the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads to shade the merchants and travelers in the summer months ; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow .",

Furthermore , government consumption ( government activity excluding transfer payments ) represents between 15 – 20 % of GDP , but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger . Thus , the more government consumption there is , the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards .",

The 1895 Assay Commission report confirms that the dime was there , as it was counted by the Counting Committee . The dime is not mentioned as having been either weighed or assayed ; Oliver and Kelly , in a May 2011 article in The Numismatist , suggest that Barnett used that privilege of assay commissioners to obtain the rarity .

Many reviews quoted and commented on Samson 's prologue to explain both the apocalyptic premise and the mythology of the show . Some reviews asserted that the good and evil creatures described in the prologue were Ben and Justin , preparing for a final battle . Still , many reviews were reluctant to state who of the main characters was good and who was evil , aware that it might take some time until this question was answered for sure . Ben and his healing powers led most reviewers to believe that he was the good creature , and that Justin was a demon or at least a dangerous zealot who received instructions from either God or Satan . Some reviews described the question of Ben 's parentage as one of the big puzzles and the show 's driving mystery , but refrained from defining further details of the series .

Traditionally , the Massachusetts House of Representatives paid the salaries of the governor , lieutenant governor , and superior court judges . From the Whig perspective , this arrangement , by keeping royally appointed officials accountable to democratically elected representatives , was an important check on executive power . In 1772 , Massachusetts learned that the those officials would henceforth be paid by the British government rather than by the province . To protest this development , in November 1772 Adams and his colleagues devised a system of committees of correspondence ; the towns of Massachusetts would consult with each other concerning political matters via messages sent through a network of committees that recorded British activities and protested imperial policies .

  "One of the most important influences on History of a Six Weeks ' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden , Norway , and Denmark ( 1796 ) , written by Mary Shelley 's mother Mary Wollstonecraft .

  "The appeal began on 29 February 2008 in the Victorian Court of Appeal . Nine Network lawyers argued that the network should be allowed to broadcast the first three episodes of the series , arguing Justice King had erred in her decision to suppress the series because she had viewed the unedited version , rather than the final edited cut that was to be shown to audiences . The network believed the first three episodes , which depicted events from the beginning of the underworld war in 1995 , would have no potential to prejudice any part of the trial . Goussis 's murder trial was due to begin on 31 March 2008 . The judges overseeing the appeal retired to decide their verdict on 3 March 2008 .

During the appeal the Nine Network had proposed to screen the first three episodes immediately after any successful appeal , and would give the court seven days written notice of its intention to show any further episodes that it believed would not prejudice the murder trial . The Court of Appeal had dismissed the network 's application to appeal , and the network was compelled to comply with the suppression order issued by Justice King until the offending trial was complete .",

As greyhounds are much larger than hares but less agile , they find it difficult to follow the hares ' sharp turns which they make to evade the dogs . This agility gives the hare an important and often crucial advantage as it seeks to escape . Under some coursing club rules , the dogs are awarded points on how many times they can turn the hare , and how closely they force the hare 's progress . In the UK , the contest between the greyhounds was usually judged from horseback , and the winning greyhound proceeded to the next round of a knock @-@ out tournament . The 2003 UK coursing season ran from 1 October to 28 February .",
  "Since García Márquez 's parents were more or less strangers to him for the first few years of his life , his grandparents influenced his early development very strongly . His grandfather , whom he called \" Papalelo \" , was a Liberal veteran of the Thousand Days War . The Colonel was considered a hero by Colombian Liberals and was highly respected . He was well known for his refusal to remain silent about the banana massacres that took place the year after García Márquez was born . The Colonel , whom García Márquez described as his \" umbilical cord with history and reality , \" was also an excellent storyteller . He taught García Márquez lessons from the dictionary , took him to the circus each year , and was the first to introduce his grandson to ice — a \" miracle \" found at the United Fruit Company store . He would also occasionally tell his young grandson \" You can 't imagine how much a dead man weighs \" , reminding him that there was no greater burden than to have killed a man , a lesson that García Márquez would later integrate into his novels .",
  "St Hill 's bowling style led critics to name him the \" Maurice Tate of the West Indies \" ; Tate was a leading English bowler of the period who took 155 Test match wickets . In the late @-@ 1920s , St Hill was judged to be a cricketer of potential . At the time , a critic in Barbados rated him \" medium to fast \" , but noted that he was not as effective on turf pitches as he was on matting , and his fielding was weak . An article in the Trinidad Sporting Chronicle from the same period named him as \" the best fast medium bowler in the West Indies \" . It noted that he was capable of bowling to slow the scoring of runs , or to attempt to dismiss the batsmen , a good fielder and a fast @-@ scoring batsman . It called him a \" real Test match cricketer \" , and \" a player whose accuracy of length , swerve and pace makes him an asset to any team and the equal of Constantine and Griffith at their best . \" At the time he joined Lowerhouse , a profile in a Burnley newspaper stated that he was a steady bowler who kept to a consistent good length . Additionally , he was a good , although \" impetuous \" batsman .",

  "Richard 's approach to kingship was rooted in his strong belief in the royal prerogative , the inspiration of which can be found in his early youth , when his authority was challenged first by the Peasants ' Revolts and then by the Lords Appellant . Richard rejected the approach his grandfather , Edward III , had taken to the nobility . Edward 's court had been a martial one , based on the interdependence between the king and his most trusted noblemen as military captains . In Richard 's view , this put a dangerous amount of power in the hands of the baronage . To avoid dependence on the nobility for military recruitment , he pursued a policy of peace towards France . At the same time , he developed his own private military retinue , larger than that of any English king before him , and gave them livery badges with his White Hart , which are also worn by the angels in the Wilton Diptych ( right ) . He was then free to develop a courtly atmosphere in which the king was a distant , venerated figure , and art and culture , rather than warfare , were at the centre .",
  "Following the end of Star Trek : Voyager , which had been used to launch UPN , they were seeking a new Star Trek series . The network contacted Rick Berman during the fifth season of Star Trek : Voyager , and informed him that if he didn 't develop a new Star Trek show then they would find someone else who would . Berman had previously been an executive producer on Voyager , and other series dating back to The Next Generation . Berman contacted Brannon Braga , and the two became the executive producers on the new show . The new series launched after the end of Voyager , but was set some 150 years before the events seen in The Original Series . The new series was originally called Enterprise , without the Star Trek prefix . UPN president Dean Valentine said that \" Paramount felt it was no longer necessary . Enterprise is synonymous with Star Trek \" . Berman 's idea was to set it in an earlier time period , with limited technology such as the ship only being able to travel up to warp 5 , as he felt that after three series being set in roughly the same time period it would be exciting for the fans .",
  "Many physical phenomena involve electrons in an essential role , such as electricity , magnetism , and thermal conductivity , and they also participate in gravitational , electromagnetic and weak interactions . An electron generates an electric field surrounding it . An electron moving relative to an observer generates a magnetic field . External electromagnetic fields affect an electron according to the Lorentz force law . Electrons radiate or absorb energy in the form of photons when accelerated . Laboratory instruments are capable of containing and observing individual electrons as well as electron plasma using electromagnetic fields , whereas dedicated telescopes can detect electron plasma in outer space . Electrons are involved in many applications such as electronics , welding , cathode ray tubes , electron microscopes , radiation therapy , lasers , gaseous ionization detectors and particle accelerators .",

  "After producing the music for Oni , O 'Donnell was tasked with composing the music for Bungie 's next project , which would be unveiled at E3 2000 . After talking with Joseph Staten , O 'Donnell decided the music needed to be \" big , exciting , and unusual with a classical orchestra touch to give it some weight and stature . We also wanted it to have some sort of ' ancient ' feel to it . \" O 'Donnell came up with the idea of opening the piece with gregorian chant and jotted down the melody in his car . Because he did not know how long the presentation would be , O 'Donnell created \" smushy \" opening and closing sections that could be expanded or cut as time required to back up a rhythmic middle section . The music was recorded and sent to New York the same night the piece was finished ; the resulting music became the basis for the Halo series ' \" highly recognizable \" signature sound , and what has been called one of the best @-@ known video game themes . The use of chant in the main theme has been credited with contributing to popular interest in the genre . Halo 's music used an interactive engine to change music in response to player 's actions ; this non @-@ linear method has since become widespread . The scores for Halo and its sequel Halo 2 garnered awards such as The Game Developer 's Choice Award and Best Original Video Game Soundtrack from Rolling Stone .",
  "Insect ecology is the scientific study of how insects , individually or as a community , interact with the surrounding environment or ecosystem . Insects play one of the most important roles in their ecosystems , which includes many roles , such as soil turning and aeration , dung burial , pest control , pollination and wildlife nutrition . An example is the beetles , which are scavengers that feed on dead animals and fallen trees and thereby recycle biological materials into forms found useful by other organisms . These insects , and others , are responsible for much of the process by which topsoil is created .",
  "Lindsay Anderson commented after the Cannes screening that Pather Panchali had \" the quality of ultimate unforgettable experience \" . In subsequent years , critics have given positive reviews . A 1958 review in Time described Pather Panchali as \" perhaps the finest piece of filmed folklore since Robert Flaherty 's Nanook of the North \" . In her 1982 book 5001 Nights at the Movies , Pauline Kael wrote , \" Beautiful , sometimes funny , and full of love , it brought a new vision of India to the screen \" . Basil Wright considered it \" a new and incontrovertible work of art \" .
