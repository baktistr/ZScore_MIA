  "Chinese painting during the Song dynasty reached a new level of sophistication with further development of landscape painting . The shan shui style painting — \" shan \" meaning mountain , and \" shui \" meaning river — became prominent features in Chinese landscape art . The emphasis laid upon landscape painting in the Song period was grounded in Chinese philosophy ; Taoism stressed that humans were but tiny specks amongst vast and greater cosmos , while Neo @-@ Confucianist writers often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed caused all social and natural phenomena . The making of glazed and translucent porcelain and celadon wares with complex use of enamels was also developed further during the Song period . Longquan celadon wares were particularly popular in the Song period . Black and red lacquerwares of the Song period featured beautifully carved artwork of miniature nature scenes , landscapes , or simple decorative motifs . However , even though intricate bronze @-@ casting , ceramics and lacquerware , jade carving , sculpture , architecture , and the painting of portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on branches were held in high esteem by the Song Chinese , landscape painting was paramount . By the beginning of the Song dynasty a distinctive landscape style had emerged . Artists mastered the formula of creating intricate and realistic scenes placed in the foreground , while the background retained qualities of vast and infinite space . Distant mountain peaks rise out of high clouds and mist , while streaming rivers run from afar into the foreground .",

The Phillies signed him as an amateur free agent on December 4 , 1998 for US $ 8 @,@ 000 , and he made his professional debut in 1999 with the Dominican Summer League ( DSL ) team DSL Phillies , with whom he compiled a .305 batting average , 4 home runs , and 35 runs batted in ( RBIs ) in 60 games . Prior to the 2000 season , Ruiz met Mick Billmeyer , the Phillies ' minor league catching coordinator , who served as his mentor . Billmeyer sought to learn Spanish while Ruiz sought to learn English , and the two bonded as Billmeyer helped mold Ruiz into an eventual top prospect and ultimately a starting catcher . In 2000 , he came to America , progressing to play in the Gulf Coast League ( GCL ) for the GCL Phillies , and hitting .277 in 38 games . He earned another promotion in 2001 , playing for the Lakewood BlueClaws of Class A Minor League Baseball . In 2001 , his performance was similar in quality to his first two seasons , and he was promoted to the Clearwater Threshers of Class A @-@ Advanced , with whom he played over parts of the next two seasons . He struggled at the plate in 2002 , compiling just a .213 batting average in 92 games , but hit .315 in 15 games in 2003 , and that year earned another promotion .",

  "Periyar 's ideas on Tamil alphabet reforms and his reasons were for the following such as the vowel ' ஈ ' ( i ) , having a cursive and looped representation of the short form , ' இ ' ( I ) . In stone inscriptions from 400 or 500 years ago , many Tamil letters are found in other shapes . As a matter of necessity and advantage to cope with printing technology , Periyar thought that it was sensible to change a few letters , reduce the number of letters , and alter a few signs . He further explained that the older and the more divine a language and its letters were said to be , the more they needed reform . Because of changes brought about by means of modern transport and international contact , and happenings that have attracted words and products from many countries , foreign words and their pronunciations have been assimilated into Tamil quite easily . Just as a few compound characters have separate signs to indicate their length as in ' கா ' , ' கே ' ( kA : , kE : ) , Periyar argued why should not other compound characters like ' கி ' , ' கீ ' , ' கு ' , ' கூ ' ( kI , ki : , kU , ku : ) ( indicated integrally as of now ) , also have separate signs . Further , changing the shape of letters , creating new symbols and adding new letters and similarly , dropping those that are redundant , were quite essential according to Periyar . Thus , the glory and excellence of a language and its script depend on how easily they can be understood or learned and on nothing else \"",

  "In order to resolve the problem of the excessive growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community , a study sponsored by the India – Canada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute ( TERI ) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets , which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region . Two options for the biomass conversion were studied . The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel . The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as feed material due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content , but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose . The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12 % de @-@ oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder . The lower portion , which was densified to make fuel pellets , was found to be suitable for use as fuel . Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3 @,@ 400 calories per kilogram ( 14 @,@ 200 kJ / kg ) with ash content of 27 % . Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “ an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population . ” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood . Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake , thus converting the waste into wealth . The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park . The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners ; this is reported to have been implemented .",

  "Despite this catastrophe , and in part because of it , Spokane experienced a building boom . [ e ] The downtown was rebuilt , and the city was reincorporated under the present name of \" Spokane \" in 1891 . According to historian David H. Stratton , \" From the late 1890s to about 1912 , a great flurry of construction created a modern urban profile of office buildings , banks , department stores , hotels and other commercial institutions , \" which stretched from the Spokane River to the site of the Northern Pacific railroad tracks below the South Hill . Yet the rebuilding and development of the city was far from smooth : between 1889 and 1896 alone , all six bridges over the Spokane River were destroyed by floods before their completion . In the 1890s the city was subject to intrastate migration by African @-@ Americans from Roslyn , looking for work after the closure of the area 's mines . Two African @-@ American churches , Calvary Baptist and Bethel African Methodist Episcopal , were founded in 1890 . Just three years after the fire , in 1892 , James J. Hill 's Great Northern Railway arrived in the chosen site for Hill 's rail yards , the newly created township of Hillyard ( annexed by Spokane in 1924 ) . Spokane became an important rail shipping and transportation hub for the Inland Empire , connecting mines in the Silver Valley with agricultural areas around the Palouse region . The city 's population ballooned to 19 @,@ 922 in 1890 , and to 36 @,@ 848 in 1900 with the arrival of additional railroads . By 1910 the population had hit 104 @,@ 000 , and Spokane eclipsed Walla Walla as the commercial center of the Inland Empire . In time the city came to be known as the \" capital \" of the Inland Empire and the heart of a vast tributary region . After the arrival of the Northern Pacific , Union Pacific , Great Northern , and Chicago , Milwaukee , St. Paul and Pacific railroads , Spokane became one of the most important rail centers in the western U.S.",

The Queen was originally to be named Grimhilde ( but who is never actually named in the film ) , was also modeled in part on Princess Kriemhild in the 1924 film Die Nibelungen .

  "In the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year . To eradicate smallpox , each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading , by isolation of cases and vaccination of everyone who lived close by . This process is known as \" ring vaccination \" . The key to this strategy was the monitoring of cases in a community ( known as surveillance ) and containment . The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases , as many cases did not come to the attention of the authorities . The fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection , and that carriers did not exist , played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox . The WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities . Early on , donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the Soviet Union and the United States , but by 1973 , more than 80 percent of all vaccine was produced in developing countries .",

Saruman initially had proposed that the wizards ally themselves with the rising power of Sauron in order to eventually control him for their own ends . Saruman went on to suggest that they could take the Ring for themselves and challenge Sauron . When Gandalf refused both options , variously because the Ring can only be wielded by one person ; because the Ring would merely channel a powerful user to become just another dark lord ; and mostly because he now recognized Saruman as a traitor , Gandalf was imprisoned in the tower of Orthanc at Isengard . Saruman hoped to learn from him the location of the Ring . Whilst on the summit of Orthanc Gandalf observed that Saruman had industrialised the formerly green valley of Isengard and was creating his own army of Half @-@ Orcs / Half @-@ Human fighters who are able to endure the sun and wolves to rival Sauron . Gandalf 's escape from the roof on the back of a Great Eagle left Saruman in a desperate position as he knew he would now be known as traitor to his former allies , but was unable to procure the Ring directly for himself and therefore could not hope to truly rival his enemy Sauron .",
  "At the end of the action Tripoli was severely damaged ; 30 of her crew were dead and another 30 were injured . The polacca 's first lieutenant was among the casualties and Admiral Rous himself was injured in the fighting . In what amounted to a total American victory over the Tripolitans , Enterprise had suffered only superficial damage and no casualties .

However , before setting her free , the Americans cut down Tripoli 's masts and sufficiently disabled her so that she could barely make sail . Sterett then continued his journey to Malta and picked up the supplies for which he was sent before returning to the blockade .",

  "The CPC views the world as organized into two opposing camps ; socialist and capitalist . They insist that socialism , on the basis of historical materialism , will eventually triumph over capitalism . In recent years , when the party has been asked to explain the capitalist globalization occurring , the party has returned to the writings of Karl Marx . Despite admitting that globalization developed through the capitalist system , the party 's leaders and theorist argue that globalization is not intrinsically capitalist . The reason being that if globalization was purely capitalist , it would exclude an alternative socialist form of modernity . Globalization , as with the market economy , therefore does not have one specific class character ( neither socialist or capitalist ) according to the party . The instance that globalization is not fixed in nature , comes from Deng 's insistence that China can pursue socialist modernization by incorporating elements of capitalism . Because of this there is considerable optimism within the CPC that despite the current capitalist dominance of globalization , globalization can be turned into a vehicle supporting socialism .",

  "The mirror [ in Las Meninas ] faces the observer as in Van Eyck 's painting . But here the procedure is more realistic to the degree that the \" rearview \" mirror in which the royal couple appears is no longer convex but flat . Whereas the reflection in the Flemish painting recomposed objects and characters within a space that is condensed and deformed by the curve of the mirror , that of Velázquez refuses to play with the laws of perspective : it projects onto the canvas the perfect double of the king and queen positioned in front of the painting .

  "The production process for Fantasy Black Channel gathered pace around December 2007 . Late of the Pier usually proceeded by taking bedroom recordings into the studio , where they were refined by Alkan into \" a more presentable package \" . They tried unconventional techniques in the style of avant garde producer Joe Meek during the live studio recording sessions , including stamping in baths and reamping guitars through air vents . When tracks were mixed after being recorded , the band members , Alkan , and engineer Jimmy Robertson worked in tandem and unanimously decided when a track had finished undergoing the studio effects process .

  "Not every commentator agreed with Colquhoun 's estimate , which became \" the most widely quoted sum \" , but in the opinion of Cindy McCreery the fact that most people agreed there were far too many prostitutes in London is indicative of widespread concern about the trade . Attitudes towards prostitution hardened at the end of the 18th century , with many viewing prostitutes as indecent and immoral , and it was in this atmosphere that Harris 's List met its demise . Books such as the Wandering Whore and Edmund Curll 's Venus in the Cloyster ( 1728 ) are often mentioned alongside Harris 's as examples of erotic literature . Along with the anonymously written Fifteen Plagues of a Maidenhead ( 1707 ) , Garfield and Curll 's works were involved in cases that helped form the 18th @-@ century legal concept of \" obscene libel \" — which was a marked change from the previous emphasis on controlling sedition , blasphemy and heresy , traditionally the ecclesiastical courts ' province .

Curll 's experience with the censors was uncommon , though , and prosecutions based on obscene publications remained a rarity . Although their court action spelled the end for Harris 's List , despite the best efforts of the Proclamation Society ( later the Society for the Suppression of Vice ) , the publication of pornography continued apace ; more pornographic material was published during the Victorian era than at any time previously .",

  "Historian Ban Zhao ( 45 – 116 CE ) wrote in her Lessons for Women that , like the opposite and complementary forces of yin and yang , men 's great virtues were strength and rigidity , while a woman 's great virtues were respect and compliance . Throughout her life , a Han woman was to bend to the will of first her father , then her husband , and then her adult son ( 三從四德 ) . However , there are many recorded deviations from this rule , as some Han women are written to have engaged in heated arguments with their husbands over concubines ( sometimes beating concubines out of jealousy and to punish the husband ) , wrote essays and letters for husbands serving as government officials , and sometimes husbands turned to their wives for advice on political affairs of the court . When a father died , the eldest son was theoretically the senior member of the family , yet as hinted in various works of Han literature , they still had to obey the will of their mother and she could even force them to kowtow to her when apologizing for an offense . Deviations from common customs regarding gender were especially pronounced in the imperial family . The empress was able to give orders to her male relatives ( even her father ) and if they disobeyed her , she could publicly reprimand and humiliate them .",

His time in New York was marked by divisive politics resulting from Leisler 's Rebellion ( 1689 – 1691 ) , and difficult and ultimately unsuccessful negotiations to keep the Iroquois from engaging in peace talks with New France .

Captain Mike Hall of the Coast Guard stated that \" at least 82 percent of the oil on board New Carissa never reached the wildlife or the pristine shoreline of Oregon 's coast \" . The environmental impact of the sinking of the bow section was thought to be minimized since it was towed out beyond the continental shelf , into very deep water .

During Operation Earnest Will , the United States ensured that neutral oil tankers and other merchant ships could safely transit the Persian Gulf during the Iran – Iraq War . Iranian attacks on tankers prompted Kuwait to ask the United States in December 1986 to register 11 Kuwaiti tankers as American ships so that they could be escorted by the U.S. Navy . President Reagan agreed to the Kuwaiti request on 10 March 1987 , hoping it would deter Iranian attacks .

In late July 1987 , Rear Admiral Harold J. Bernsen , commander of the Middle East Force , requested NSW assets . Special Boat Teams deployed with six Mark III Patrol Boats and two SEAL platoons in August .

  "When the railways were nationalised in 1948 , services at Avonmouth Dock came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways . By 1955 , service levels had decreased slightly to 28 trains per day from Bristol and 29 return , but the services were at regular intervals . Passenger numbers however dropped sharply in 1961 as the result of a fare increase , and so in 1962 a new reduced timetable was enacted , which lost more passengers . A year later in 1963 , the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line , but ultimately only those beyond Severn Beach or via Henbury were withdrawn . Goods services from the station ended on 20 June 1966 , the same day that the station was renamed \" Avonmouth \" . The bay platform was taken out of use and the land later taken for industrial buildings . From 17 July 1967 all staffing was withdrawn from stations along the line , including Avonmouth , with tickets issued by the train guard . The station buildings on the island platform survived into the 1970s , as did the footbridge , but with the exception of the parcels office , all were later demolished . The parcels office was in use in 2006 as a hairdressing salon . The signal box was closed in January 1969 , and in September 1973 the wooden level crossing gates were replaced by automatic lifting barriers . By 1974 , service had reduced to 19 trains per day in each direction , with no Sunday services to Severn Beach .",

Smythe switched his support to John Diefenbaker . Smythe wrote over 300 letters to Members of Parliament . In 1965 , he unsuccessfully lobbied for the Red Ensign to be flown at the Gardens instead of the new Flag of Canada .

  "Percherons were first imported into the United States in 1839 , although only one of the initial four horses survived the ocean trip . Soon after , two stallions and two mares were imported ; one mare died shortly after arrival and one stallion went blind and was retired within a year . Although the first importations of Percherons were less than successful , the remaining stallion , named Diligence , was credited with siring almost 400 foals . In 1851 , three stallions were imported : Normandy 351 , Louis Napoleon 281 and Gray Billy . Throughout their stud careers , each had significant influence on American draft horse stock . In the mid @-@ 19th century in the United States , Percheron stallions were crossed with homebred mares to improve the local stock , resulting in thousands of crossbred horses . After the American Civil War in the 1860s greatly reduced the number of horses , there was a significant need for large draft horses , especially in growing cities and in the expanding West . Large numbers of Percherons were imported to the United States beginning in the early 1870s , and they became popular with draft horse breeders and owners . In the 1880s , approximately 7 @,@ 500 horses were exported to the United States . This extensive importation lasted until 1893 , when the US experienced a financial panic , and virtually no Percheron imports occurred between 1894 and 1898 . In addition , many existing horses were lost as people were too poor to purchase or care for large draft horses . In 1898 , importations began again as abruptly as they had ceased , with an average of 700 horses a year imported between 1898 and 1905 . In 1906 alone , over 13 @,@ 000 horses were imported to the United States from France .

  "The Carolina Marsh Tacky developed from Spanish horses brought to the island and coastal areas of South Carolina by Spanish explorers and settlers as early as the 16th century . More horses were added to the population that would become the Marsh Tacky through animals that were purchased in the Spanish settlement of St. Augustine in Florida . They were then used as pack horses on Native American trade routes , and sold when the traders reached Charleston . They were managed mainly as feral herds , rounded up by locals when horses were needed , and this tradition continued into the 20th century . The breed was used during the American Revolution by many of the irregular forces of Francis Marion , nicknamed the \" Swamp Fox \" . The swamp savvy of the Marsh Tacky may have given Marion 's forces an advantage , as British cavalry mounted on larger European breeds were not as easily able to maneuver in the dense lowland swamps . After the American Civil War , they were commonly used by members of the Gullah community on the islands off the South Carolina shore for use in fields and gardens . The breed derives the \" tacky \" part of its name from the English word meaning \" common \" or \" cheap \" , as these horses were the most common breed in their area of the country for most of their history . During the height of their popularity they ranged from Myrtle Beach , South Carolina to St. Simon 's Island in Georgia .

  "Richard and Maria Edgeworth state that \" She [ Honora ] was of opinion that the art of education should be considered as an experimental science \" , and that the failures of the past were due to \" following theory rather than practice \" . Richard Edgeworth and Honora then set about applying the emerging principles of educational psychology to the actual practice of education . From their reading of theory they determined that the reason Barbauld was successful was that the child 's reading was rewarded ( thus departing radically from Rousseau ) , because it was associated with pleasure .

With her husband , Honora wrote the first version of Practical Education as a children 's book Practical education : or , the history of Harry and Lucy for Honora her daughter , which was begun in 1778 and privately published in February 1780 in Lichfield as Practical Education , vol 2 . The book tells a simple story of two parents and their two model children , Harry and Lucy , who carry out domestic chores and ask their parents many questions , the answers to which may be deemed educational . The children explain their discoveries and how they learn , the whole presented as nine forms of learning . As originally conceived it was intended to be the second part of a series of three books , but the remaining parts remained unwritten . The original plan had been for a collaborative work , contributed to by various members of the Lunar Society. it was an ambitious project designed to fill what they perceived of as major deficiencies in the field of both technical and scientific education and to introduce early ideas on morality , science and other academic disciplines into the developing mind of the young child . After Honora Sneyd 's premature death , her sister Elizabeth continued the work , in her role as the third wife of Richard Edgeworth . The final version of the book was authored by Richard and Maria Edgeworth and published after both Honora and her sister Elizabeth 's deaths , in 1798 , and further revised under Maria 's name as Early lessons ( 1801 – 1825 ) .

  "Procellariids , as well as having strong natal philopatry , exhibit strong site fidelity , returning to the same nesting site , burrow or territory in sequential years . The figure varies for different species but is high for most species , an estimated 91 % for Bulwer 's petrels . The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex ; almost 85 % of male Cory 's shearwaters return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt , while the figure for females is around 76 % . This tendency towards using the same site from year to year is matched by strong mate fidelity , with birds breeding with the same partner for many years ; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked , site fidelity being a means by which partnered birds could meet at the beginning of the breeding season . One pair of northern fulmars bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years .

  "Part one , the Commentary upon Littleton , was undoubtedly the most famous ; copies were exported to the United States early in the colonial era . The work was first printed in an American edition in 1812 , by which point the English version was in its sixteenth edition , and had been commented on itself by various later legal authorities . As with the Reports , Coke 's Institutes became a standard textbook in the United States , and was recorded in the law libraries of Harvard College in 1723 and Brown University in 1770 ; John Jay , John Adams , Theophilus Parsons and Thomas Jefferson were all influenced by it . John Rutledge later wrote that \" Coke 's Institutes seems to be almost the foundations of our law \" , while Jefferson stated that \" a sounder Whig never wrote more profound learning in the orthodox doctrine of British liberties \" . The Third Institutes has been described as \" the first really adequate discussion of treason , a work which went far towards offering the remedy of a humanized common law to the injustices of trial procedures \" .",

  "Historically Bhutan is known by numerous names , but the Bhutanese call the country Druk after the name of the Bhutanese thunder dragon . This tradition dates to 1189 when Tsangpa Gyare Yeshe Dorje , founder of the Drukpa lineage of Tibetan Buddhism , was in Phoankar ( Tibet ) where he reportedly witnessed the Namgyiphu valley glowing with rainbow and light . Considering this an auspicious sign , he entered the valley to choose a site for the construction of a monastery , whereupon he heard three peals of thunder – a sound produced by the druk ( dragon ) according to popular Bhutanese belief . The monastery that Tsangpa Gyare built that year was named Druk Sewa Jangchubling , and his school of teaching became known as Druk . The Druk school later split into three lineages . One of these three , Drukpa , was founded by Tsangpa Gyare 's nephew and spiritual heir Önrey Dharma Sengye and afterward spread throughout Bhutan . The nation itself would also later become known as Druk . This legend offers one explanation for how the symbolism of the dragon came to form the basis of the national flag of Bhutan . An alternative hypothesis maintains that the notion of symbolizing sovereign and state in the form of a dragon emerged in neighboring China and was adopted by the rulers of Bhutan as a symbol of royalty in the early 20th century .",

In 1955 – 56 Peng was involved in a large number of efforts to moderate Mao 's popular image , developing into a personal campaign .

One reason posited was the battle fatigue of his men in the late afternoon , although \" Allegheny \" Johnson 's division of Ewell 's Corps was within an hour of arriving on the battlefield . Another was the difficulty of assaulting the hill through the narrow corridors afforded by the streets of Gettysburg immediately to the north . Ewell requested assistance from A.P. Hill , but that general felt his corps was too depleted from the day 's battle and General Lee did not want to bring up Maj. Gen. Richard H. Anderson 's division from the reserve . Ewell did consider taking Culp 's Hill , which would have made the Union position on Cemetery Hill untenable . However , Jubal Early opposed the idea when it was reported that Union troops ( probably Slocum 's XII Corps ) were approaching on the York Pike , and he sent the brigades of John B. Gordon and Brig.

After Johnson 's division arrived via the Chambersburg Pike , it maneuvered toward the east of town in preparation to take the hill , but a small reconnaissance party sent in advance encountered a picket line of the 7th Indiana Infantry , which opened fire and captured a Confederate officer and soldier .

  "The Central Committee ( CC ) is the CPV 's most powerful institution . It delegates some of its powers to the Secretariat and the Politburo when it is not in session . When the Vietnam War ended in 1975 , the Vietnamese leadership , led by Lê Duẩn , began to centralise power . This policy continued until the 6th National Congress , when Nguyễn Văn Linh took power . Linh pursued a policy of economic and political decentralisation . The party and state bureaucracy opposed Linh 's reform initiatives ; because of this , Linh tried to win the support of provincial leaders . This caused the powers of the provincial chapters of the CPV to increase in the 1990s . The CPV lost its power to appoint or dismiss provincial @-@ level officials in the 1990s ; this is proven by the fact that Võ Văn Kiệt tried to wrestle this power back to the centre during the 1990s without success . These developments led to the provincialisation of the Central Committee ; for example , more and more CC members have a background in provincial party work . Because of these changes , power in Vietnam has become increasingly devolved . The number of Central Committee members with a provincial background increased from a low of 15 @.@ 6 percent in 1982 to a high of 41 percent in 2001 .

  "Tristano studied for bachelor 's and master 's degrees in music in Chicago before moving to New York City in 1946 . He played with leading bebop musicians and formed his own small bands , which soon displayed some of his early interests – contrapuntal interaction of instruments , harmonic flexibility , and rhythmic complexity . His quintet in 1949 recorded the first free group improvisations . Tristano 's innovations continued in 1951 , with the first overdubbed , improvised jazz recordings , and two years later , when he recorded an atonal improvised solo piano piece that was based on the development of motifs rather than on harmonies . He developed further via polyrhythms and chromaticism into the 1960s , but was infrequently recorded .",
  "The Dutch Empire held the Dutch Cape Colony , Dutch Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies . The latter , now Indonesia , was governed by the Dutch East India Company from the highly lucrative port of Batavia . Batavia was the centre of East Asian trade , reaching as far as Nagasaki in Edo period Japan , supported by other towns and ports including Sourabaya and Griessie . The Cape Colony at the Southern tip of Africa was far less significant , acting principally as a resupply harbour with little commercial activity or penetration into the surrounding countryside . The commercially significant harbours of Trincomalee and Colombo on the island of Ceylon were of strategic importance , but weakly garrisoned against attack . These colonies were defended by a Dutch naval squadron , sent to the region in 1782 in the aftermath of the American War of Independence .",

  "William Johnstone ( 1897 – 1981 ) was one of the artists most closely associated with the Scottish Renaissance , an attempt to introduce modernism into art and to create a distinctive national art . He studied cubism , surrealism and was introduced to new American art by his wife the sculptor Flora Macdonald . He moved towards abstraction , attempting to utilise aspects of landscape , poetry and Celtic art . His most significant work , A Point in Time ( 1929 – 38 ) , has been described by art historian Duncan Macmillan as \" one of the most important Scottish pictures of the century and one of the most remarkable pictures by any British painter in the period \" . Stanley Cursiter ( 1887 – 1976 ) was influenced by the Celtic revival , post @-@ impressionism and Futurism . Later in his career he became a major painter of the coastline of this native Orkney .

The design team isolated the components that they felt made Batman , and exaggerated these elements . Design ideas which contradicted these facets of the character were dropped , and other elements of Batman , such as his refusal to kill his enemies , were strictly enforced , which provided additional challenges in allowing the player to have complete freedom in the game without transgressing on that fundamental aspect of the character .

  "The species breeds in North America and winters in the Caribbean .

The northern population mainly winters in the western Caribbean ( Cuba and Jamaica ) while the southern population usually spends the winter on eastern islands ( Hispaniola and Puerto Rico ) . Moreover , males in the southern population have darker plumage than those in the northern population . These differences have led biologists to consider them as separate subspecies . However , a recent study in the United States reveals no significant genetic differentiation between northern ( samples from Michigan , New Hampshire and New York states ) and southern populations ( sample from North Carolina ) . The study results actually show a recent population expansion from a single glacial refugium , therefore the current populations are homogeneous in terms of genetics .

  "After Pollexfen recovers from the attack , he sets out to duel Grandison . However , Grandison refuses on the grounds that dueling is harmful to society . After explaining why obedience to God and society are important , Grandison wins Pollexfen over and obtains his apology to Byron for his actions . She accepts his apology , and he follows with a proposal to marriage . She declines because she , as she admits , is in love with Grandison . However , a new suitor , the Earl of D , appears , and it emerges that Grandison promised himself to an Italian woman , Signorina Clementina della Porretta . As Grandison explains , he was in Italy years before and rescued the Barone della Porretta and a relationship developed between himself and Clementina , the baron 's only daughter . However , Grandison could not marry her , as she demanded that he , an Anglican Protestant , become a Catholic , and he was unwilling to do so . After he left , she grew ill out of despair , and the Porrettas were willing to accept his religion , if he would return and make Clementina happy once more . Grandison , feeling obligated to do what he can to restore Clementina 's happiness , returns to Italy ; however , Clementina determines she can never marry a \" heretic \" , and so Grandison returns to England and Harriet who accepts him . They are married ; and everyone is accorded their just deserts .",

  "The Gesta Hungarorum 's reliability — particularly regarding Gelou , Glad , Menumorut and the other rulers described as fighting the conquering Magyars — has been debated by scholars since the publication of the chronicle during the late 18th century . Most Romanian historians ( including Vlad Georgescu , Alexandru Madgearu and Victor Spinei ) believe that Anonymus ' story of the three dukes and their realms is reliable . According to Florin Curta , Romanian archaeologists \" made every possible effort ... to prove that the Gesta was a reliable source for the medieval history of ( Romanian ) Transylvania \" during the excavations at Dăbâca ( Gelou 's assumed seat ) between the late 1960s and 1980s , but they were \" embarrassed that no substantial evidence was found to prove the Gesta right \" . Madgearu says that Anonymus ' \" account about the conquest \" of Transylvania \" combines data taken from oral tradition with invented facts \" , but \" Gelou was a real person and his name could be considered authentic \" . Spinei also writes that most reports in the Gesta Hungarorum \" are not inventions , but they have a real support , even if here and there some anachronisms occurred . \" He cites the role of the Cumans as an example , saying that the Hungarian word translated by Anonymus as \" Cumans \" ( kun ) originally referred to any nomadic Turkic tribe . Other historians ( including István Bóna , Dennis Deletant , Pál Engel and Gyula Kristó ) write that Anonymus had no real knowledge of the Carpathian Basin ( including Transylvania ) at the time of the Hungarian conquest and invented all the opponents of the Hungarians because he needed characters to be defeated by the conquerors . According to this view , Gelou is one of a half @-@ dozen \" imaginary figures \" — including Laborec , Menumorut and Zobor — named by Anonymus for a river , hill or settlement . If this theory is true , Gelou was named after Gilău ( Gyalu in Hungarian ) , a Transylvanian village in which Gelou dies in the Gesta . According to Tudor Sălăgean , the village of Gilău was apparently named for the duke . Zoltán Kordé says that the names of the village and the duke may have Hungarian or Turkic origins .",

The core gameplay of Dead Head Fred revolves around Fred 's missing head and his ability to \" switch \" heads by defeating certain enemies , decapitating them , and collecting their heads ( referred to as \" headhunting \" ) . As Fred explores the city of Hope Falls , he can collect an assortment of heads , each of which has unique abilities . Examples include the Stone Idol head , which Fred can use as a battering ram , and the Corpse head , which can be used to suck up and spit out water , gasoline , and other materials . Fred uses these heads to navigate the city of Hope Falls , and certain parts of the city are not accessible until certain heads are found . The high level of radiation in Hope Falls has led to a proliferation of grossly mutated worms , which the player can collect and use to upgrade Fred 's heads and temporarily increase his fighting abilities , among other benefits . Also collectible are money and special items , which can be earned by defeating enemies or completing various side @-@ missions .

  "The presence of an analogous RMS in humans has been difficult to identify , possibly because the olfactory bulb is significantly less developed in humans than in rodents and thus harder to study , and much of the previous scientific work has been called into question concerning the RMS in humans . In the developing fetal brain and in young postnatal infants , chains of immature neurons typical of the RMS were observed . However , there was little evidence for the existence of a migrating chain along the SVZ or olfactory peduncle to the bulb in the adult human brain , even though there was a distinct population of adult neuronal stem cells in the SVZ . These researchers studied subjects from 0 to 84 years of age by analyzing brain sections that had been removed during surgery or during autopsies . They discovered that cells that expressed DCX ( doublecortin ) and PSA @-@ NCAM are present in the brain sections taken from infants , but have disappeared by 18 months . Yet further studies indicated the presence of a small population of migrating immature neurons , which originate solely from the SVZ . These neuroblasts appear singly or in pairs without forming chains , in contrast to the elongated chains of neuroblasts observed in the rodent RMS . This suggests that the RMS is drastically reduced beyond infancy and especially into adulthood , but is not absent . However , a direct correlation between stem cell quiescence and age has not yet been defined due to a high level of variability between individuals . Thus an RMS analogous structure in the adult human brain remains highly controversial .",

  "A black legend about the Duke of Northumberland was already in the making when he was still in power , the more after his fall . From the last days of Henry VIII he was to have planned , years in advance , the destruction of both King Edward 's Seymour uncles — Lord Thomas and the Protector — as well as Edward himself . He also served as an indispensable scapegoat : It was the most practical thing for Queen Mary to believe that Dudley had been acting all alone and it was in nobody 's interest to doubt it . Further questions were unwelcome , as Charles V 's ambassadors found out : \" it was thought best not to inquire too closely into what had happened , so as to make no discoveries that might prejudice those [ who tried the duke ] \" . By renouncing the Protestantism he had so conspicuously stood for , Northumberland lost every respect and became ineligible for rehabilitation in a world dominated by thinking along sectarian lines . Protestant writers like John Foxe and John Ponet concentrated on the pious King Edward 's achievements and reinvented Somerset as the \" good Duke \" — it followed that there had also to be a \" wicked Duke \" . This interpretation was enhanced by the High and Late Victorian historians , James Anthony Froude and A. F. Pollard , who saw Somerset as a champion of political liberty whose desire \" to do good \" was thwarted by , in Pollard 's phrase , \" the subtlest intriguer in English History \" .",
  "The site of Mycenae was the first in Greece to be subjected to modern archaeological excavation . It was excavated by the German archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann in 1876 . Schliemann , inspired by Homer ’ s descriptions in the Iliad , in which Mycenae is termed \" abounding in gold \" , began digging there . He was also following the accounts of the ancient geographer Pausanias who , during the 2nd century AD , described the once prosperous site and mentioned that according to a local tradition , the graves of Agamemnon and his followers , including his charioteer Eurymedon and the two children of Cassandra , were buried within the citadel . What Schliemann discovered in his excavation satisfied both his opinion of Homer 's historical accuracy and his craving for valuable treasures . Among the objects he unearthed in Grave Circle A was a series of gold death masks , including one he proclaimed \" The Death Mask of Agamemnon \" . Schliemann cleared five shafts and recognized them as the graves mentioned by Pausanias . He stopped his exploration after the fifth grave was explored , believing that he had finished excavating the Grave Circle , however a year later Panagiotis Stamatakis found a sixth shaft grave .",

  "Amargasaurus is classified as a member of the Dicraeosauridae , a family ranked clade within the Diplodocoidea . Currently , this clade consists of five species belonging to four genera . These are , besides Amargasaurus cazaui , the species Dicraeosaurus hansemanni and Dicraeosaurus sattleri from the Late Jurassic Tendaguru beds of Tanzania , and the recently described Brachytrachelopan mesai from the Late Jurassic of Argentina . Whitlock ( 2011 ) argued that Suuwassea emilieae from the Morrison Formation of the United States has to be placed inside the Dicraeosauridae as well , which was supported by subsequent studies . Amargasaurus is the only named dicraeosaurid from the Cretaceous ; however , an unnamed specimen from Brazil indicates that this group persisted until the end of the Early Cretaceous . Most analyses find Dicraeosaurus and Brachytrachelopan to be more closely related to each other than to Amargasaurus . Suuwassea was recovered as the most basal member of the family .

After the death of her brother , Ladislaus IV of Hungary , in 1290 , Queen Mary announced her claim to Hungary , stating that the House of Árpád ( the royal family of Hungary ) had become extinct with Ladislaus 's death . However , her father 's cousin , Andrew also laid claim to the throne , although his father , Stephen the Posthumous , had been regarded a bastard by all other members of the royal family . For all that , the Hungarian lords and prelates preferred Andrew against Mary and he was crowned king of Hungary on 23 July 1290 . She transferred her claim to Hungary to Charles Martel in January 1292 . The Babonići , Frankopans , Šubići and other Croatian and Slavonian noble families seemingly acknowledged Charles Martel 's claim , but in fact their loyalty vacillated between Charles Martel and Andrew III .",

  "The crew moved to Warner Bros. Studios ' Stage 16 to shoot the T. rex 's attack on the LSX powered SUVs . Shooting proved frustrating because of water soaking the foam rubber skin of the animatronic dinosaur , which caused the animatronic T. rex to shake and quiver from the extra weight when the foam absorbed the water . This forced Stan Winston 's crew to dry the model with shammys between takes . On the set , Malcolm distracting the dinosaur with a flare was included at Jeff Goldblum 's suggestion , as he felt a heroic action was better than going by the script , where like Gennaro , Malcolm would get scared and run away . The ripples in the glass of water caused by the T. rex 's footsteps were inspired by Spielberg listening to Earth , Wind and Fire in his car , and the vibrations the bass rhythm caused . Lantieri was unsure of how to create the shot until the night before filming , when he put a glass of water on a guitar he was playing , which achieved the concentric circles in the water Spielberg wanted . The next morning , guitar strings were put inside the car and a man on the floor plucked the strings to achieve the effect .

Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode 's lack of complexity was refreshing , but ultimately the \" awkward \" performances and \" cheesy \" approach to its subject matter detracted from it . Writing for The A.V. Club , Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode a B , describing it as \" an episode about a man who finds himself trying to lose his faith but being unable to do so \" . VanDerWerff felt that the episode suffered from \" the typical Millennium problems \" , including \" an overreliance on trite philosophical dialogue \" ; however , he found that it contained \" something pure and believable at its core that keeps the episode moving along nicely \" . The episode 's thematic concern with the role of religion in society was noted as being \" the tension Millennium would build its best episodes on \" . Bill Gibron , writing for DVD Talk , rated \" Kingdom Come \" 5 out of 5 , describing it as being \" classic Millennium \" . Gibron felt that the episode had \" an exceptional script that delightfully fails to spell everything out for us up front \" , and noted that it served as \" the blueprint for all better Millennium episodes to come \" .",

  "The medium half @-@ life of 227Ac ( 21 @.@ 77 years ) makes it very convenient radioactive isotope in modeling the slow vertical mixing of oceanic waters . The associated processes cannot be studied with the required accuracy by direct measurements of current velocities ( of the order 50 meters per year ) . However , evaluation of the concentration depth @-@ profiles for different isotopes allows estimating the mixing rates . The physics behind this method is as follows : oceanic waters contain homogeneously dispersed 235U . Its decay product , 231Pa , gradually precipitates to the bottom , so that its concentration first increases with depth and then stays nearly constant . 231Pa decays to 227Ac ; however , the concentration of the latter isotope does not follow the 231Pa depth profile , but instead increases toward the sea bottom . This occurs because of the mixing processes which raise some additional 227Ac from the sea bottom . Thus analysis of both 231Pa and 227Ac depth profiles allows to model the mixing behavior .",

  "The day after Haakon 's death , the Birkebeiner designated Guttorm as king at a meeting of the hird , in consultation with Bishop Martin of Bergen . Sverre 's nephew Haakon the Crazy was simultaneously appointed regent as leader of the hird and the army . According to the Bǫglunga sǫgur ( Bagler sagas ) , the young king then took a sword and mounted it to Haakon 's side , and handed him a shield . He further gave Haakon the title of earl , with consent from all the chieftains , and had Haakon sit next to him at his throne . Haakon 's unusually strong position was thus symbolised by his sitting at the same level as the king , and not on a lower seat as would have been customary for an earl . Another of Sverre 's nephews , Peter Støyper , together with Einar Kongsmåg , husband of Sverre 's daughter Cecilia , were appointed as Guttorm 's guardians .",
  "After the assassination of Martin Luther King , Jr. in April 1968 , Lindsay feared that rioting would occur in Harlem . He traveled to the neighborhood to express condolences ; Clarence 13X and his followers were among those who accompanied him as he walked the streets . Clarence 13X also instructed his followers to try to prevent violence and looting . He was commended by the city 's leadership for his efforts , and they subsequently agreed to help him publish a book of Five Percenter teachings and portions of the Quran . Willieen Jowers recalled that Clarence 13X admitted that his previous teachings about racial hatred were wrong around this time . He later described himself as \" neither anti @-@ white nor pro @-@ black \" and saw some of his white contacts with the city as allies in the advancement of his teachings . His white convert was released from state custody and joined his teacher in Harlem during the February 1969 nor 'easter . He was accepted as a Five Percenter , as Clarence 13X maintained that \" civilization \" — rather than race — was valued by the group . Clarence 13X made possibly contradictory statements about whether white individuals could be reformed . Contrary to his radical reputation , he endorsed some conservative positions in the late 1960s , including capital punishment , respect for the U.S. flag , and American involvement in Vietnam . He also allowed his supporters to attend Christmas celebrations . Knight notes that these shifts may have been intended to decrease suspicions of law enforcement . Clarence 13X was then allowed to visit a juvenile detention center to speak to young Five Percenters and won some concessions from the institution 's leadership .

  "Finally , the successor of Djedkare , Unas , is thought to have been his son in spite of the complete lack of evidence bearing on the question . The main argument in favor of this filiation is that the succession from Djedkare Isesi to Unas seems to have been smooth , as suggested indirectly , for example , by the Abusir papyri . Indirect evidence also comes from the reliefs of Unas ' causeway , which show many officials bearing names incorporating \" Isesi \" , suggesting at the very least that Unas did not perceive Djedkare as an antagonist .",
  "A second major wave of workhouse construction began in the mid @-@ 1860s , the result of a damning report by the Poor Law inspectors on the conditions found in infirmaries in London and the provinces . Of one workhouse in Southwark , London , an inspector observed bluntly that \" The workhouse does not meet the requirements of medical science , nor am I able to suggest any arrangements which would in the least enable it to do so \" . By the middle of the 19th century there was a growing realisation that the purpose of the workhouse was no longer solely or even chiefly to act as a deterrent to the able @-@ bodied poor , and the first generation of buildings was widely considered to be inadequate . About 150 new workhouses were built mainly in London , Lancashire and Yorkshire between 1840 and 1875 , in architectural styles that began to adopt Italianate or Elizabethan features , to better fit into their surroundings and present a less intimidating face . One surviving example is the gateway at Ripon , designed somewhat in the style of a medieval almshouse . A major feature of this new generation of buildings is the long corridors with separate wards leading off for men , women and children .",
  "John Bad Elk v. United States , 177 U.S. 529 ( 1900 ) , was a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that an individual had the right to use force to resist an unlawful arrest and was entitled to a jury instruction to that effect . In 1889 , a tribal police officer , John Bad Elk , shot and killed another tribal police officer who was attempting to arrest Bad Elk without a warrant , on a misdemeanor charge , for a crime allegedly committed outside of the presence of the arresting officer . The Supreme Court reversed his conviction , noting that a person had the right to resist an unlawful arrest , and in the case of a death , murder may be reduced to manslaughter . The Supreme Court held the arrest to be unlawful due , in part , to the lack of a valid warrant . This case has been widely cited on the internet , but is no longer considered good law in a growing number of jurisdictions . Most states have , either by statute or by case law , removed the unlawful arrest defense for resisting arrest . The case also received negative treatment in 532 U.S. 318 ( 2001 ) holding that an arrest without a warrant , even for a misdemeanor , is lawful .",
  "Spinosaurus anatomy exhibits another feature that may have a modern homology : its long tail resembled that of the thresher shark , employed to slap the water to herd and stun shoals of fish before devouring them ( Oliver et al.2013 ) . The strategies that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against shoaling fish are more effective when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘ bait ball ’ ( Helfman , Collette & Facey , 1997 ; Oliver et al.2013 ; Domenici et al.2014 ) . Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve , they cooperate in this effort . When herding a shoal of fish or squid , sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger . When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads , their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically ( Lauder & Drucker , 2004 ) . Domenici et al . ( 2014 ) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing . The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash . This means that prey is less likely to recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator ( Marras et al.2015 ; Webb & Weihs 2015 ) . Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and thresher sharks . Interestingly , Spinosaurus exhibited the anatomical features required to combine all three hunting strategies : a sail for herding prey more efficiently , as well as flexible tail and neck to slap the water for stunning , injuring or killing prey . The submerged dorsal sail would have provided a strong centreboard @-@ like counterforce for powerful sidewards movements of the strong neck and long tail , as performed by sailfish ( Domenici et al.2014 ) or thresher sharks ( Oliver et al.2013 ) . While smaller dorsal sails or fins make the dorsal water volume better accessible for slashing , it can be speculated that their smaller stabilization effect makes lateral slashing less efficient ( e.g. for thresher sharks ) . Forming a hydrodynamic fulcrum and hydrodynamically stabilizing the trunk along the dorsoventral axis , Spinosaurus ’ sail would also have compensated for the inertia of the lateral neck by tail movements and vice versa not only for predation but also for accelerated swimming . This behaviour might also have been one reason for Spinosaurus ’ muscular chest and neck reported by Ibrahim et al . ( 2014 ) . \" Finally , it is quite possible that the sail or hump combined these functions , acting normally as a heat regulator , becoming a courting aid during the mating season , being used to cool itself and , on occasions , turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threatened .",

  "Female @-@ female aggression , which is fairly rare in other marine vertebrates , is common among loggerheads . Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat . This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds . Escalation typically follows four steps . First , initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues . Second , confrontation occurs , beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head @-@ tail circling . They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other . Third , sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other ’ s jaws . The final stage , separation , is either mutual , with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions , or involves chasing one out of the immediate vicinity . Escalation is determined by several factors , including hormone levels , energy expenditure , expected outcome , and importance of location . At all stages , an upright tail shows willingness to escalate , while a curled tail shows willingness to submit . Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating , contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds . Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads . The turtles are seemingly territorial , and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species .",

  "A variation of the spray transfer mode , pulse @-@ spray is based on the principles of spray transfer but uses a pulsing current to melt the filler wire and allow one small molten droplet to fall with each pulse . The pulses allow the average current to be lower , decreasing the overall heat input and thereby decreasing the size of the weld pool and heat @-@ affected zone while making it possible to weld thin workpieces . The pulse provides a stable arc and no spatter , since no short @-@ circuiting takes place . This also makes the process suitable for nearly all metals , and thicker electrode wire can be used as well . The smaller weld pool gives the variation greater versatility , making it possible to weld in all positions . In comparison with short arc GMAW , this method has a somewhat slower maximum speed ( 85 mm / s or 200 in / min ) and the process also requires that the shielding gas be primarily argon with a low carbon dioxide concentration . Additionally , it requires a special power source capable of providing current pulses with a frequency between 30 and 400 pulses per second . However , the method has gained popularity , since it requires lower heat input and can be used to weld thin workpieces , as well as nonferrous materials .",

  "Initiation , known as Reception ( receptio ) into the order , was a profound commitment and involved a solemn ceremony . Outsiders were discouraged from attending the ceremony , which aroused the suspicions of medieval inquisitors during the later trials . New members had to willingly sign over all of their wealth and goods to the order and take vows of poverty , chastity , piety , and obedience . Most brothers joined for life , although some were allowed to join for a set period . Sometimes a married man was allowed to join if he had his wife 's permission , but he was not allowed to wear the white mantle .",
  "The player with the white pieces always moves first . After the first move , players alternately move one piece per turn ( except for castling , when two pieces are moved ) . Pieces are moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent 's piece , which is captured and removed from play . With the sole exception of en passant , all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent 's piece occupies . A player may not make any move that would put or leave his or her king under attack . A player cannot \" pass \" ; at each turn they have to make a legal move ( this is the basis for the finesse called zugzwang ) .",
  "Ganymede 's discovery is credited to Galileo Galilei , who was the first to observe it on January 7 , 1610 . The satellite 's name was soon suggested by astronomer Simon Marius , for the mythological Ganymede , cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus 's lover . Beginning with Pioneer 10 , spacecraft have been able to examine Ganymede closely . The Voyager probes refined measurements of its size , whereas the Galileo craft discovered its underground ocean and magnetic field .

  "The growth , development , and reproduction of organisms relies on cell division , or the process by which a single cell divides into two usually identical daughter cells . This requires first making a duplicate copy of every gene in the genome in a process called DNA replication . The copies are made by specialized enzymes known as DNA polymerases , which \" read \" one strand of the double @-@ helical DNA , known as the template strand , and synthesize a new complementary strand . Because the DNA double helix is held together by base pairing , the sequence of one strand completely specifies the sequence of its complement ; hence only one strand needs to be read by the enzyme to produce a faithful copy . The process of DNA replication is semiconservative ; that is , the copy of the genome inherited by each daughter cell contains one original and one newly synthesized strand of DNA .",

  "Although Kagame 's primary reason for the two wars in the Congo was Rwanda 's security , he was alleged to gain economic benefit by exploiting the mineral wealth of the eastern Congo . The 2001 United Nations Report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo alleged that Kagame , along with Ugandan President Museveni , were \" on the verge of becoming the godfathers of the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo \" . The report also claimed that the Rwandan Ministry of Defence contained a \" Congo Desk \" dedicated to collecting taxes from companies licensed to mine minerals around Kisangani , and that substantial quantities of coltan and diamonds passed through Kigali before being resold on the international market by staff on the Congo Desk . International NGO Global Witness also conducted field studies in early 2013 . It concluded that minerals from North and South Kivu are exported illegally to Rwanda and then marketed as Rwandan . Kagame dismissed these allegations as unsubstantiated and politically motivated ; in a 2002 interview with newsletter Africa Confidential , Kagame said that if solid evidence against Rwandan officers was presented , it would be dealt with very seriously . In 2010 , the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the First and Second Congo Wars , charges denied by the Rwandan government .",

  "Hurricane Jimena originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on August 15 . The tropical wave traversed the Atlantic Ocean with little or no convective development .

  "The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein , and directed by Wes Archer . The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling . Oakley said another inspiration for it was that there had not been many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how \" crummy \" the town was , so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how \" crummy \" and \" dismal \" Springfield was . Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling . The \" way they radiate out \" had always amazed him .

  "Enemy encounters trigger a combat mode . As in Chrono Trigger , enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party and thus are not random . Similar to Final Fantasy 's Active Time Battle , each character has a meter that gradually fills with time . When the meter is full , characters can physically attack enemies , use MysTech magic , unleash BattleSkill attacks , use items , move to a different position , or use a nearby object to attack , if present . For playable characters and computer @-@ controlled enemies , each attack has their number of hit points ( a numerically based life bar ) get reduced , which can be restored through healing items or MysTech slags . Use of MysTech and equippable shield cells require Neutron @-@ Radiated Glodents ( NRG ) , a separate energy reserve displayed beneath a character 's life bar . NRG is replenished through certain items . Use of BattleSkills require Bouge , a third bar beneath NRG that automatically fills with time ; players can use different BattleSkills depending on how full the Bouge bar is . Some characters must undergo certain plot developments to unlock their BattleSkills . When a playable character loses all hit points , he or she faints . If all the player 's characters fall in battle , the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved game . Winning battles earns experience points and raises characters ' levels , granting them improved statistics . These statistics can be viewed through the status screen , which displays important character information and current quests . Unlike many other RPGs , Anachronox displays a character 's attributes with qualitative descriptors ( such as Poor and Excellent ) instead of integers .",

  "Initially , the state highway was poorly constructed and largely impassable , mirroring the condition of the roadways that preceded it . An act passed by the state legislature on June 19 , 1812 , indicated that the funds that had been allocated to the highway were \" entirely inadequate to open and improve \" the road . On April 17 , 1816 , the state attempted to correct the issue by approving a measure that appointed two sets of commissioners to oversee the reconstruction of the highway . Each set was to work on opposite ends of the route and eventually converge at a point midway along the route . Work on the highway was completed by 1818 . The road was officially named the \" North West Bay Road \" ; however , it eventually became known as the \" Old Military Road \" . The route did not enter the village of Lake Placid ; instead , it bypassed it to the southwest . This portion of the highway is still known today by the latter name .",

  "Penn State 's edition of SB Nation also predicted the Lions would lose citing the Wolverines ' better athletes , but noted that Michigan 's quarterback Devin Gardner has thrown as many interceptions as touchdowns ( 8 ) coming into the game , and that Penn State 's best chance to win would be if Michigan turned the ball over frequently .

The system initially drifted northwest along the edge of a weak ridge ; however , steering currents soon collapsed and left the depression to meander in the same general region for four days . Strong wind shear stemming from the nearby Hurricane Andres precluded intensification of the nascent depression .

Formation of a central dense overcast on June 1 marked the transition into a tropical storm , at which time the system was assigned the name Blanca . As shear steadily relaxed , conditions became exceptionally favorable for rapid intensification . Accordingly the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme showed a 90 percent chance of winds increasing by 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) in 24 hours , among the highest probabilities seen by National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) forecaster Michael Brennan .",

  "The earliest phases of the Big Bang are subject to much speculation . In the most common models the universe was filled homogeneously and isotropically with a very high energy density and huge temperatures and pressures and was very rapidly expanding and cooling . Approximately 10 − 37 seconds into the expansion , a phase transition caused a cosmic inflation , during which the universe grew exponentially . After inflation stopped , the universe consisted of a quark – gluon plasma , as well as all other elementary particles . Temperatures were so high that the random motions of particles were at relativistic speeds , and particle – antiparticle pairs of all kinds were being continuously created and destroyed in collisions . At some point an unknown reaction called baryogenesis violated the conservation of baryon number , leading to a very small excess of quarks and leptons over antiquarks and antileptons — of the order of one part in 30 million . This resulted in the predominance of matter over antimatter in the present universe .",

  "A 1994 landscape survey identified woodland to the north of the village as having contained ancient flint tools and what appeared to be flint boundary markers , the latter apparently gathered from loose @-@ lying surface flints . The area around the village features ancient deneholes , or agricultural chalk mines , some of which are pre @-@ Roman . These holes , which may be up to 30 metres ( 98 ft ) deep , were often dug at the edges of fields , onto which the chalk marl would be spread . A Lower Palaeolithic ( Acheulian ) hand axe was unearthed in the garden of Blacksmiths cottage in the village . In 1966 , the remains of a U @-@ shaped mediaeval pastoral enclosure for controlling the movement of stock were recorded in woodland to the north of the village . The extensive woodland in the parish also meant that it was one of several sources of wooden planking for the piers of Rochester Bridge ( 16 miles ( 26 km ) away ) from the early 11th century ( and theoretically was still liable to do so until the passing of the Rochester Bridge Act in 1908 ) .",
  "This time the mere presence of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition . Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing , Epaminondas decided that he would have to break the stalemate . Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea , and that Sparta was practically undefended , he planned an audacious night @-@ time march on Sparta itself . However , the Spartan king Archidamus was alerted to this move by an informant , probably a Cretan runner , and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well @-@ defended . Although he did attack the city , he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not , after all , surprised the Spartans . Furthermore , the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day , and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again . Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta , Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea , and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea . However , a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well . Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close , and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea , Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed , he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle .",

The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem , the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun , which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy .

While in Hollywood , Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand , Elliott Gould and Steve McQueen but she never managed to feel at home there .",
  "Towards the end of the 14th century , the position of fairs began to decline . The larger merchants , particularly in London , began to establish direct links with the larger landowners such as the nobility and the church ; rather than the landowner buying from a chartered fair , they would buy directly from the merchant . Meanwhile , the growth of the indigenous England merchant class in the major cities , especially London , gradually crowded out the foreign merchants upon whom the great chartered fairs had largely depended . The crown 's control over trade in the towns , especially the emerging newer towns towards the end of the 15th century that lacked central civic government , was increasingly weaker , making chartered status less relevant as more trade occurred from private properties and took place all year around . Nonetheless , the great fairs remained of importance well into the 15th century , as illustrated by their role in exchanging money , regional commerce and in providing choice for individual consumers .",

Subfossil bones later found on Rodrigues were correlated with the bird in the manuscript ; in 1879 , these bones became the basis for a new species , Necropsar rodericanus ( the Rodrigues starling ) , named by ornithologists Albert Günther and Edward Newton . Although they found the Rodrigues bird closely related to the hoopoe starling , Günther and Newton kept it in a separate genus due to \" present ornithological practice \" . American ornithologist James Greenway suggested in 1967 that the Rodrigues starling belonged in the same genus as the hoopoe starling , due to their close similarity . Subfossils found in 1974 confirmed that the Rodrigues bird was a distinct genus of starling ; primarily , its stouter bill warrants generic separation from Fregilupus . In 2014 , British palaeontologist Julian P.

Much of the female population of an emerging 19th century Wales was based in the low @-@ waged , densely @-@ populated , industrialised valleys of the south . At first women found work in metalworking and coal extraction , but then faced mass unemployment after the 1842 Mines and Collieries Act had prohibited them from working underground . The coal mining industry , with its absence of pithead baths , led to unpaid women 's employment as the need to keep both their homes and the family 's menfolk clean became a never ending task . This led to the image of the stoic Welsh Mam , a matriarch of the home , but little could be further from the truth in a society controlled by men .",
  "A set procedure was used by a division that was moving into the front line . Once they had been informed that they were moving forward , the brigadiers and battalion commanders would be taken to the forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops . Meanwhile , the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the division that they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition , and the manner in which they were supplied to the troops at the front . Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving . Five days later , the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams , and the grenade officer , the machine gun officer , the four company commanders , and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in . Overnight , the battalions would move into the line , and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position , leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved .",

  "Further , Basinger considers Bataan to provide a definition @-@ by @-@ example of \" the World War II combat film \" , in which a diverse and apparently unsuited group of \" hastily assembled volunteers \" hold off a much larger group of the enemy through their \" bravery and tenacity \" . She argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film . Since she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during the Second World War , in her view these few films , central to the genre , are outweighed by the many other films that lie on the margins of being war films . However , other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film , to include films that deal \" with the roles of civilians , espionage agents , and soldiers in any of the aspects of war ( i.e. preparation , cause , prevention , conduct , daily life , and consequences or aftermath . ) \" Neale points out that genres overlap , with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film , and suggests that war films are characterised by combat which \" determines the fate of the principal characters \" . This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of war films . Not all critics agree , either , that war films must be about 20th century wars . James Clarke includes Edward Zwick 's Oscar @-@ winning Glory ( 1990 ) among the war films he discusses in detail ; it is set in the American Civil War , and he lists six other films about that war which he considers \" notable \" .",

  "P. labiata females are extremely aggressive to other females , trying to invade and take over each other 's webs , which often results in cannibalism . A laboratory test showed how they minimise the risk of meeting each other , by recognising pieces with blotting paper containing their own silk draglines and pieces contain other P. labiata females ' draglines . If obstacles make it impossible to see whether the other is physically present , she avoids blotting paper containing the other 's draglines , but moves with no constraint if she can see that the other female is not around . Draglines seem to act as territory marks , much as many mammals identify conspecifics by scent marking . P. labiata females also avoid rival females of higher fighting ability and spend more time around less powerful fighters . A laboratory test collected samples of the draglines of equal @-@ sized females and then pitted some of them in contests .

  "Yet another interpretation is that Dylan is directing the farewell to himself , particularly his acoustic performer self . The opening line \" You must leave now \" can be a command , similar to the line \" Go away from my window \" that opens \" It Ain 't Me , Babe \" . But it can also be an imperative , meaning just that it is necessary that you leave . And the song is as much about new beginnings as it is about endings . The song not only notes the requirement that Baby Blue leave , but also includes the hope that Baby Blue will move forward , in lines such as \" Strike another match , go start anew \" . If Dylan is singing the song to himself , then he himself would be the \" vagabond who 's rapping at your door / standing in the clothes that you once wore \" . That is , the new , electric , surrealist Dylan would be the vagabond , not yet having removed the \" clothes \" of the old protest singer . Alternatively , the vagabond and \" stepping stones \" referenced in the song have been interpreted as Dylan 's folk audience whom he needs to leave behind . He would also be telling himself to \" Forget the dead you 've left , they will not follow you . \" Others to whom he may be saying farewell in the song are any of the women he had known , the political left or to the illusions of his youth .",

  "Unlike the Aztecs and the Incas , the Maya political system never integrated the entire Maya cultural area into a single state or empire . Rather , throughout its history , the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both states and chiefdoms . These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships with each other and were engaged in a complex web of rivalries , periods of dominance or submission , vassalage , and alliances . At times , different polities achieved regional dominance , such as Calakmul , Caracol , Mayapan , and Tikal . The first reliably evidenced polities formed in the Maya lowlands in the 9th century BC . During the Late Preclassic , the Maya political system coalesced into a theopolitical form , where elite ideology justified the ruler 's authority , and was reinforced by public display , ritual , and religion . The divine king was the centre of political power , exercising ultimate control over the administrative , economic , judicial , and military functions of the polity . The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilise both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects , apparently with no police force or standing army . Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration , and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives . Within a polity , mid @-@ ranking population centres would have played a key role in managing resources and internal conflict .",

Still another source states that Masoandro was one of three traditional wooden houses still standing at the Rova when Madagascar was colonised by the French , with the implication that the name was applied to distinct buildings at various times .",

He held a synod in 736 or 737 , which drew nine bishops ; the meeting adjudicated a dispute over the ownership of a monastery located at Withington .
