  "The period of the later 1950s and early 1960s , between the end of the initial period of innovation and what became known in the US as the \" British Invasion \" , has traditionally been seen as an era of hiatus for rock and roll . More recently some authors have emphasised important innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible . While early rock and roll , particularly through the advent of rockabilly , saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers , in this era the genre was dominated by black and female artists . Rock and roll had not disappeared at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the Twist dance craze of the early 1960s , mainly benefiting the career of Chubby Checker . Having died down in the late 1950s , doo wop enjoyed a revival in the same period , with hits for acts like the Marcels , the Capris , Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs , and Shep and the Limelights . The rise of girl groups like the Chantels , the Shirelles and the Crystals placed an emphasis on harmonies and polished production that was in contrast to earlier rock and roll . Some of the most significant girl group hits were products of the Brill Building Sound , named after the block in New York where many songwriters were based , which included the number 1 hit for the Shirelles \" Will You Love Me Tomorrow \" in 1960 , penned by the partnership of Gerry Goffin and Carole King .",

  "Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory , practice , and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes insurrection within anarchist practice . It is critical of formal organisations such as labour unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses . Instead , insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small affinity group based organisation . Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack , permanent class conflict , and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies .",

However , a date range of 1σ represents only 68 % confidence level , so the true age of the object being measured may lie outside the range of dates quoted . This was demonstrated in 1970 by an experiment run by the British Museum radiocarbon laboratory , in which weekly measurements were taken on the same sample for six months .

William Schneiderman , secretary of the California Communist Party , was a naturalized American until the government revoked his citizenship , stating that he had concealed his membership on his application for naturalization in 1927 . Two lower federal courts upheld the denaturalization . Representing a communist , and in wartime , did nothing to shore up Willkie 's diminishing support in the Republican Party , but he wrote to a friend , \" I am sure I am right in representing Schneiderman .

  "At 21 : 00 , the British observed a fire on the lower decks of the Orient ( the French flagship ) . Identifying the danger this posed to the Orient , Captain Hallowell directed his gun crews to fire their cannon directly into the blaze . Sustained British cannon fire spread the flames throughout the ship 's stern and prevented all efforts to extinguish it . Within minutes the flames had ascended the rigging and set the vast sails alight . The nearest British ships , Swiftsure , Alexander , and Orion , all stopped firing , closed their gunports , and began edging away from the blazing ship in anticipation of the detonation of the enormous ammunition supplies stored on board . In addition , they took crew away from the guns to form fire parties and soak the sails and decks in seawater to help contain any resulting blazes . Likewise the French ships Tonnant , Heureux and Mercure all cut their anchor cables and drifted southwards away from the blazing ship . At 22 : 00 the fire reached the magazines and the Orient was almost completely destroyed by a massive explosion . The concussion of the blast alone was sufficient to rip open the seams of the nearest ships , and flaming wreckage landed in a huge circle , much of it flying directly over the surrounding ships into the sea beyond . Falling wreckage started fires on Swiftsure , Alexander , and Franklin , although in each case teams of sailors with water buckets succeeded in extinguishing the flames , despite a secondary explosion on Franklin .",

The Americans were expected to win , and with his typically slow start , Thorpe turned a body length behind with 50 m remaining . With an American victory seeming inevitable , Thorpe managed to accelerate and deprive Ervin of the lead in the last 5 m . This made Thorpe the only swimmer to have won six gold medals at a World Championships , and the first since Shaw in 1974 to win the 200 – 400 – 800 treble . His performances formed the basis for Australia 's gold medal win over the United States 13 – 9 .

  "The first type of transformer to see wide use was the induction coil , invented by Rev. Nicholas Callan of Maynooth College , Ireland in 1836 . He was one of the first researchers to realize the more turns the secondary winding has in relation to the primary winding , the larger the induced secondary EMF will be . Induction coils evolved from scientists ' and inventors ' efforts to get higher voltages from batteries . Since batteries produce direct current ( DC ) rather than AC , induction coils relied upon vibrating electrical contacts that regularly interrupted the current in the primary to create the flux changes necessary for induction . Between the 1830s and the 1870s , efforts to build better induction coils , mostly by trial and error , slowly revealed the basic principles of transformers .",

However , the staging proved awkward during filming , so John Krasinski suggested that only Jim go down to the parking lot while the others stayed behind , and the change was eventually incorporated into the episode .",

  "Smith met Kissinger in Pretoria on 18 September 1976 to discuss the terms .

  "The New York classical music scene included Charles Griffes , originally from Elmira , New York , who began publishing his most innovative material in 1914 . His early collaborations were attempts to use non @-@ Western musical themes . The best @-@ known New York composer was George Gershwin . Gershwin was a songwriter with Tin Pan Alley and the Broadway theatres , and his works were strongly influenced by jazz , or rather the precursors to jazz that were extant during his time .

Charles Ives was one of the earliest American classical composers of enduring international significance , producing music in a uniquely American style , though his music was mostly unknown until after his death in 1954 .",

This argument is evident at Montacute , where Gothic pinnacles , albeit obelisk in form , are combined with Renaissance gables , pediments , classical statuary , ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass . This profusion of large , mullioned windows , an innovation of their day , give the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass ; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire . However , despite the Dutch gables , a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England , and the Gothic elements , much of the architectural influence is Italian .",

  "Although Smith maintained his innocence , detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran 's death and those of the other two women . Witnesses had seen him leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde , and he was the last person to see them both alive . CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation , and even captured Hyde getting out at one point to visit a chemist . Smith was seen buying petrol from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde 's body was later discovered . Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo 's . CCTV footage showed him driving around Bromsgrove , a town close to Droitwich , after killing Corcoran , and later film showed him returning to Birmingham . At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him : a motorist who saw him buying petrol , and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance . Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight , although he had no visible signs of injury .",
  "During Coolidge 's presidency , the United States experienced a period of rapid economic growth known as the \" Roaring Twenties . \" He left the administration 's industrial policy in the hands of his activist Secretary of Commerce , Herbert Hoover , who energetically used government auspices to promote business efficiency and develop airlines and radio . Coolidge disdained regulation , and demonstrated this by appointing commissioners to the Federal Trade Commission and the Interstate Commerce Commission who did little to restrict the activities of businesses under their jurisdiction . The regulatory state under Coolidge was , as one biographer described it , \" thin to the point of invisibility . \"",
  "Secret of Mana was originally planned to be a launch title for the SNES @-@ CD add @-@ on . After the contract between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add @-@ on failed , and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES @-@ CD into the competing PlayStation console , Square Enix adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format . The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES game cartridge , which is much smaller than that of a CD @-@ ROM . The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add @-@ on , believing that too much of the game would have to be cut , but they were overruled by company management . As a result of the hardware change , several features had to be cut from the game , and some completed work needed to be redone . Most major of these removals was the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings , in contrast to the linear journey in the final product . The plot that remained was different than the original conception , and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone . Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations , and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game . In 2006 , Level magazine claimed that Secret of Mana 's rocky development was Square 's main inspiration to move their games , such as the Final Fantasy series , from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996 .",

  "The typical prey consists of surface organisms such as small fish , squid , crustaceans and jellyfish . The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food , often located by smell , and will follow ships . In the Atlantic , more than half the food items are zooplankton and the fish caught include small herring and sprats ; whale carcasses are scavenged where available . During digestion , the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to carotenoids . Larger prey items take longer to digest . The oil , rich in vitamin A , is produced by a large gland in the stomach . The Mediterranean subspecies ' diet is mainly fish , particularly Mediterranean sand eels . Petrels also catch opossum shrimps from waters close to the colony . Bluefin tuna farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla ; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna , a mixture of fish , squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick . Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies , and some plant material , including angiosperm seeds and sorrel , has been found in the stomach contents . A study on Leach 's storm petrel , which consumes similar items , showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight , but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects . Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils .",

Alana comes from the technologically advanced Landfall Coalition , so named after Landfall , the largest planet in the galaxy , and Marko is from Wreath , Landfall 's only satellite , whose people wield magic . Because the destruction of one of the worlds would send the other spinning out of orbit , the war was \" outsourced \" to other worlds .

  "Many studies have suggested that sexual selection plays a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in poison frogs . With female preferences in play , the coloration of males would change more rapidly . Sexual selection is influenced by many things . The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice . In the species Oophaga pumilio parental investment is not equal . The female makes the eggs and provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males makes the sperm ( less energy ) and only provides care for a few days . This differential in parental investment indicates that there will be a strong female preference . Sexual selection makes the phenotypic variation in a species increase drastically . Tazzyman and Iwasa ( 2010 ) found that there were populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection and populations that did not . In the populations that did use sexual selection , the phenotypic polymorphism was evident .",

  "Wind blowing over the surface of the sea causes friction at the interface between air and sea . Not only does this cause waves to form but it also makes the surface seawater move in the same direction as the wind . Although winds are variable , in any one place they predominantly blow from a single direction and thus a surface current can be formed . Westerly winds are most frequent in the mid @-@ latitudes while easterlies dominate the tropics . When water moves in this way , other water flows in to fill the gap and a circular movement of surface currents known as a gyre is formed . There are five main gyres in the world 's oceans : two in the Pacific , two in the Atlantic , and one in the Indian Ocean . The North Atlantic gyre that produces the Sargasso Sea accumulates salinity levels as high as 38 ‰ . Other smaller gyres are found in lesser seas and a single gyre flows around Antarctica . These gyres have followed the same routes for millennia , guided by the topography of the land , the wind direction , and the Coriolis effect . The surface currents flow in a clockwise direction in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere . The water moving away from the equator is warm , while that flowing towards it has lost most of its heat . These currents tend to moderate the Earth 's climate , cooling the equatorial region , and warming regions at higher latitudes . Global climate and weather forecasts are powerfully affected by the world ocean , so global climate modelling makes use of ocean circulation models as well as models of other major components such as the atmosphere , land surfaces , aerosols , and sea ice . Ocean models make use of a branch of physics , geophysical fluid dynamics , that describes the large @-@ scale flow of fluids such as seawater .",

The band asked different directors to make music videos for each song having tried unsuccessfully to make a film to accompany their 1999 album Guerrilla themselves .

  "Offa succeeded in having Lichfield elevated to an archbishopric , but the rise in Lichfield 's status was unpopular with Canterbury , the other southern English archbishopric . Offa was probably motivated by a desire to increase the status of his kingdom and to free his kingdom 's ecclesiastical affairs from the control of another kingdom 's archbishopric , and possibly the need to secure the coronation of Offa 's successor , which the Archbishop of Canterbury had opposed . After Offa 's death his distant relative Coenwulf became king , and petitioned the pope to have Lichfield returned to a simple bishopric .

  "His debut novel , the satirical De frafalnes klubb ( \" The Club of the Estranged \" ) , was published in 1960 . It tells a story of some fatigued cynics in France who create a new philosophical and literary \" -ism \" , which gains worldwide popularity . According to Brikt Jensen , Hambro critiques \" the modern human being [ which embraces ] the first philosophical system that comes to sight \" . In his review for Verdens Gang , Jensen commended Hambro for his \" un @-@ Norwegian \" perspective , calling him a \" distinct European \" . The literary scholar Willy Dahl opined that the novel denotes Hambro 's declared scepticism towards \" every sort of intellectual or political pigeonholing \" , a scepticism that he shared with his father C. J. Hambro , whose disdain for radical and totalitarian ideologies was well known . The elder Hambro was also , according to the literary scholar Per Thomas Andersen , vital for the next literary work of the younger Hambro : he provided biographical content to a trilogy comprising the novels Frels oss fra det gode ( 1963 ) , Utfor stryket ( 1964 ) and Vi vil oss en drøm ( 1966 ) , which delineate the adolescence of a young man named Nico Dietmeyer in the West End of Oslo . The first of them was favourably reviewed by Brikt Jensen in Verdens Gang , who called it \" a declaration of love for Oslo \" ; reviewing for the same newspaper , Ragnhild Lorentzen gave the next novel a laudatory review , commending Hambro for having taken an important task upon his shoulders , whilst also criticising him for blurring the line between adolescence and adulthood . Dahl argues that these novels constitute an unpretentious , yet perspicacious criticism of the necessity of conformity in that milieu , whilst Andersen considers them to be stories about double standards and liberation from one 's father . In September 1966 Hambro delivered a vehement critique of the Norwegian education system in the pamphlet Er gymnasiaster mennesker ? . The last novel of his trilogy about Nico Dietmeyer was released in November of the same year ; Lorentzen considered the first part of the book to be somewhat verbose and anticipative , concluding her review by calling the novel an unoriginal yet well written book . Hambro continued with Bjørnen sover ( \" The Bear Is Sleeping \" ) in 1967 , a marriage novel that disappointed the critics , before releasing his semantic and psycholinguistic study Ting , tanke , tale in 1969 . The journalist Iver Tore Svenning recognizes this work as one of the very few successful attempts at a popular scientific treatment of structural linguistics , a view supported by Dahl . Hambro 's last novels were Nødhavn and Lekkasje , released in 1971 and 1974 . The former book is about a love affair between an erstwhile cultural radical and a young woman with aggressive political opinions . The affair makes , according to Dahl , the cultural radical think about his nonconformist past , yet he abandons it , and seeks safety in the bourgeoisie class .",

  "Although these traits are shared among both living and extinct lemurs , they are uncommon among primates in general . Two prevailing hypotheses to explain these unique adaptations are the energy frugality hypothesis by Patricia Wright ( 1999 ) and the evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis by Carel van Schaik and Peter M. Kappeler ( 1996 ) . The energy frugality hypothesis expanded on Alison Jolly 's energy conservation hypotheses by claiming that most lemur traits not only help conserve energy , but also maximize the use of highly limited resources , enabling them to live in severely seasonal environments with low productivity . The evolutionary disequilibrium hypothesis postulated that living lemurs are in the process of evolving to fill open ecological niches left by the recently extinct subfossil lemurs . For example , small nocturnal prosimians are typically nocturnal and monogamous , while the larger living lemurs are generally active both day and night ( cathemeral ) and live in small groups ( gregarious ) . Cathemerality and increased gregariousness might indicate that the larger living lemurs are evolving to fill the role of the giant lemurs , which were thought to be diurnal ( day @-@ living ) and more monkey @-@ like in behavior . Since most giant subfossil lemurs have been shown to share many of the unique traits of their living counterparts , and not those of monkeys , Godfrey et al . ( 2003 ) argued that the energy frugality hypothesis seems to best explain both living and extinct lemur adaptations .",

  "Derived from the Greek ἀνατέμνω anatemnō \" I cut up , cut open \" from ἀνά ana \" up \" , and τέμνω temnō \" I cut \" , anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems , organs and tissues . It includes the appearance and position of the various parts , the materials from which they are composed , their locations and their relationships with other parts . Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry , which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved . For example , an anatomist is concerned with the shape , size , position , structure , blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the liver ; while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile , the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions .",

  "On 21 July 1940 , JG 26 \" Schlageter \" received orders to relocate to Caffiers in the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais in preparation for actions against Britain in what would become the Battle of Britain . Adolf Hitler had issued Führer Directive no . 17 ( Weisung Nr. 17 ) on 1 August 1940 ; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the RAF to achieve air supremacy , or at least air superiority , in preparation for Operation Sea Lion ( Unternehmen Seelöwe ) , the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain . III . Gruppe flew fighter protection for bomber formations attacking allied shipping in the English Channel on 24 July . These missions were referred to as Kanalkampf ( channel combat ) by the Germans . The unit flew its next mission one day later , providing fighter protection for Stuka 's again targeting shipping . Müncheberg , who had been promoted to Oberleutnant on 19 July 1940 , claimed his 10th aerial victory on 28 July when he shot down a No. 257 Squadron Hawker Hurricane 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) northeast of Dover . The claim was made at 15 : 15 . No other German pilot from JG 26 claimed a Hurricane at that time . The only loss suffered by 257 Squadron was Sergeant R.V Forward who bailed out wounded . However , RAF records show he was shot down at 18 : 40 over three hours after Müncheberg 's claim . Müncheberg was credited with his 11th victory on 8 August , claiming a No. 65 Squadron Spitfire piloted by Flight Sergeant Norman T. Phillips shot down . The claim would seem unlikely . The war diary for JG 26 \" Schlageter \" shows that Müncheberg made his claim at 12 : 55 in the afternoon as did three other pilots . No. 65 Squadron lost only two Spitfires that day , one flown by Phillips . British records show Phillips was killed in action at 10 : 45 in No. 65 Squadron 's first mission of the morning , some three hours earlier . On this day , both the Germans lost 22 aircraft shot down and 23 damaged ; the British lost 16 aircraft shot down and four damaged . Only one III . Gruppe Bf 109 was lost . The only RAF losses occurring at the time of Müncheberg 's claim were two Hurricanes belonging to No. 238 Squadron — Flight Lieutenant D.E Turner and Flying Officer D.C.

Once Bristol had been taken , more recruits would have been attracted to the Rebellion and a later march on London would have been possible .",

  "Virgin queens and males appear in colonies during January , before their nuptial flight . 20 females or fewer are found in a single colony , while males are much more common . The nuptial flight begins at different times for each species ; they have been recorded in mid @-@ summer to autumn ( January to early April ) , but there is one case of a nuptial flight occurring from May to July . Ideal conditions for nuptial flight are hot stormy days with windspeeds of 30 km / h ( 18 mi / h ) and temperatures reaching 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) , and elevations of 91 metres ( 300 ft ) . Nuptial flights are rarely recorded due to queens leaving their nest singly , although as many as four queens may leave the nest at the same time . Species are both polygynous and polyandrous , with queens mating with one to ten males . Polygynous and polyandrous societies can occur in a single nest , but particular species are either primarily polygynous or primarily polyandrous . For example , nearly 80 % of tested M. pilosula colonies are polygynous while M. pyriformis colonies are mostly polyandrous .

  "The German army 's manpower had been severely depleted after four years of war , and its economy and society were under great internal strain . The Entente now fielded a total of 216 divisions against 197 understrength German divisions . The Hundred Days Offensive beginning in August proved the final straw , and following this string of military defeats , German troops began to surrender in large numbers . As the Allied forces broke the German lines , Prince Maximilian of Baden was appointed as Chancellor of Germany in October to negotiate an armistice . Because of his opposition to the peace feelers , Ludendorff was forced to step aside and he fled to Sweden . Fighting was still continuing , but the German armies were in retreat when the German Revolution put a new government in power . An armistice was quickly signed , that stopped all fighting on the Western Front on Armistice Day ( 11 November 1918 ) . The German Imperial Monarchy collapsed as General Groener ( Ludendorff 's successor ) backed the moderate Social Democratic Government under Friedrich Ebert , rather than face the possibility of a revolution like that in Russia the previous year .",
  "Between 1769 and 1773 , the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and his father Leopold Mozart made three Italian journeys .

  "Thus , the members of the two sets of groups , and hence names , do not match , which causes problems in relating scientific names to common ( usually traditional ) names .

One remedy is to create a new common name , in this case \" hominoids \" . Another possibility is to expand the use of one of the traditional names . For example , in his 2005 book , the vertebrate palaeontologist Benton wrote , \" The apes , Hominoidea , today include the gibbons and orang @-@ utan ... the gorilla and chimpanzee ... and humans \" ; thereby Benton was using \" apes \" to mean \" hominoids \" .

Lactarius albidopallens was originally described as a form of L. blennius as Lactarius blennius f. albidopallens by Jakob Emanuel Lange in 1928 , before being classified as a separate species by J. Blum . Lange also described Lactarius blennius f. virescens , which is now recognised as nomen invalidum ( an invalid name ) . Lactarius fluens is another species that has been included in L. blennius ; originally described in 1899 by Jean Louis Émile Boudier , in 1999 , German Joseph Krieglsteiner suggested that it is actually a variety of L. blennius , naming it Lactarius blennius var. fluens . The situation with Lactarius viridis is similar ; first described as a separate species by Quélet in 1888 , A. Marchand proposed that it is in fact a variety of L. blennius , naming it Lactarius blennius var. viridis .",

Before the match , Barnes wagered £ 8 at 15 / 1 on himself to score a century , and trained especially diligently in the lead @-@ up to the Lord 's fixture . He was motivated because the Australian Board of Control had given his wife rare permission to attend the match , and the refusal of the authorities at Lord 's to allow him to practise there when he was in London a year earlier ; Barnes saw a strong personal performance as an ideal response to what he regarded as a snub .

This was done , however , because the greater size and weight of the new guns rendered beam turrets impracticable . As such , all four turrets in the Lions were arranged on the centreline , although ' Q ' turret was located amidships and was unable to fire directly aft . The Director of Naval Construction , Sir Philip Watts suggested that a fifth turret , superfiring over the rear turret , could be added if the ship was lengthened by three frames , 12 feet ( 4 m ) in total , and that this would add very little cost other than the £ 175 @,@ 000 for the additional turret , but add 25 % more firepower to the ship . This was not approved , however , possibly because of doubts about its feasibility .",

  "The Austro @-@ Hungarians entered Valjevo on 15 November , prompting wild public celebrations in Vienna . Franz Joseph praised Potiorek for seizing the town ; cities across the empire made Potiorek an honorary citizen and Sarajevo even named a street after him . Valjevo 's capture led the Austro @-@ Hungarians to believe that they were on the verge of defeating Serbia and that the Serbian Army was no longer a coherent fighting force , but the scorched earth tactics employed by the Serbs during their withdrawal complicated the Austro @-@ Hungarian advance . Although the Austro @-@ Hungarians were right in assuming that the Serbian Army was exhausted , its defensive positions along the Kolubara had been prepared months in advance . Putnik 's carefully timed withdrawals had ensured that the losses of the Serbian Army were lighter than if it had stood and fought pitched battles with the Austro @-@ Hungarians . Moreover , the geography of northwestern Serbia favoured defensive operations since the approaches to the Kolubara did not offer any cover to armies invading from the direction of Austria @-@ Hungary and the river itself was surrounded by mountainous terrain . In October , the Serbs had fortified the Jeljak and Maljen mountain ranges in anticipation of an Austro @-@ Hungarian attack . This gave them an advantage over the Austro @-@ Hungarians as it placed them in control of all roads leading to Kragujevac . The Serbs also established a series of field fortifications blocking the approach to Niš . The extensive series of fortifications and the difficulty of the terrain which they faced left the Austro @-@ Hungarians with no choice but to conduct operations in the gruelling Serbian countryside with almost no lines of communication .",

A common use of the small gold pieces was as Christmas presents — the pieces would be produced at the various mints late in the year , be purchased from banks in December and return to vaults by late January . The establishment of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 increased the circulation of banknotes , and the Mint ceased to strike quarter eagles after 1915 and half eagles after 1916 . An additional factor was the economic unrest caused by World War I , causing gold prices to rise and coins made of that metal to vanish from circulation . After the war , gold did not return to circulation , and most gold coins struck were double eagles , used for international transactions and backing for gold certificates .",

  "In effect , the Spanish Constitution of 1812 adopted by the Cortes de Cadiz served as the basis for independence in New Spain and Central America , since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states . The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America . Elections were held , local governments formed and deputies sent to the Cortes . Among liberals , however , there was fear that the new regime would not last ; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti @-@ clerical legislation . This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance . This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind Agustín de Iturbide , a colonel in the royal army , who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by Vicente Guerrero . In January 1821 , Iturbide began peace negotiations with Guerrero , suggesting they unite to establish an independent New Spain . The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became the basis of the Plan of Iguala : the independence of New Spain ( now to be called the Mexican Empire ) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor ; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its existing privileges ; and the equality of all New Spaniards , whether immigrants or native @-@ born . The following month the other important guerrilla leader , Guadalupe Victoria , joined the alliance , and March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new Army of the Three Guarantees . The representative of the new Spanish government , Superior Political Chief Juan O 'Donojú , who replaced the previous viceroys , arrived in Veracruz on July 1 ; but he found that royalists the entire country except for Veracruz , Mexico City and Acapulco . Since at the time that O 'Donojú had left Spain , the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions , O 'Donojú proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala . The resulting Treaty of Córdoba , which was signed on August 24 , kept all existing laws , including the 1812 Constitution , in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written . O 'Donojú became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8 . Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of Córdoba , and the final break with the mother country came on May 19 , 1822 , when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Itrubide .",

  "The first mechanical pumping station on the Somerset Levels was built in 1830 to drain the area around Westonzoyland , Middlezoy and Othery . The success of the drainage system led to the formation of other drainage boards and the construction of other pumping stations . The pump at Westonzoyland originally comprised a beam engine and scoop wheel ( like a water wheel running backwards ) but , after 25 years , there were problems pumping the water away because the land had dropped as it dried out despite the wheel being raised 15 inches ( 380 mm ) in 1843 . A better method was sought , and in 1861 the present Easton and Amos pump was installed . The Westonzoyland pump lifts water from the rhyne ( pronounced ' reen ' ) into the River Parrett . The pump operated until 1951 , by which time the local drainage system had been linked into King 's Sedgemoor Drain , which discharged further down the River Parrett ; the water levels dropped and the pump was unable to draw the water from the rhyne .

  "In the twentieth century Scottish agriculture became susceptible to the ups and downs of world markets . There were dramatic price rises in the First World War , but a slump in the 1920s and 1930s , in which perhaps 40 per cent of Scottish land changed hands , followed by more price rises in the Second World War . In 1947 annual price reviews were introduced in an attempt to stabilise the market . A series of Acts of Parliament followed , designed to give price support and grants to farmers . After the Second World War and the associated rationing , there was a drive in UK agriculture to greater production . This lasted until the late 1970s , resulting in more intensive farming . More areas of marginal land were brought into production with government subsidies . At the same time , the amount of forest was increased by a factor of three .

Duerr maintains that this knowledge might have ultimately led people to cast doubt on even the Devil , a key aspect of early modern Christian cosmology . Although the use of hallucinogenic ointments was not a factor in every witch trial , it was more prevalent in the earlier trials of the Alpine region .

  "In 1878 , erbium ores were found to contain the oxides of holmium and thulium . French chemist Paul Émile Lecoq de Boisbaudran , while working with holmium oxide , separated dysprosium oxide from it in Paris in 1886 . His procedure for isolating the dysprosium involved dissolving dysprosium oxide in acid , then adding ammonia to precipitate the hydroxide . He was only able to isolate dysprosium from its oxide after more than 30 attempts at his procedure . On succeeding , he named the element dysprosium from the Greek dysprositos ( δυσπρόσιτος ) , meaning \" hard to get \" . The element was not isolated in relatively pure form until after the development of ion exchange techniques by Frank Spedding at Iowa State University in the early 1950s .",

  "At the time , Hurricane Ava 's minimum known pressure of 915 mbar ( 27 @.@ 0 inHg ) was the lowest known in its basin , making Ava the most intense Pacific hurricane . Ava is now the fifth most intense , tied with Hurricane Ioke , as Hurricanes Patricia , Linda , Rick and Kenna recorded lower pressures . However , Linda 's and Rick 's pressures were only estimated from satellite imagery , so Ava held the record for lowest measured pressure until Kenna surpassed it in 2002 . However , the meteorological record for the eastern north Pacific are unreliable because geostationary satellite observation did not begin until 1966 . Ava 's pressure record is itself incomplete ; Ava was only a Category 4 when its 915 mbar ( 27 @.@ 0 inHg ) pressure was measured , and the only reading when it was a Category 5 is 928 mbar ( 27 @.@ 4 inHg ) . These two factors mean that Ava 's lowest pressure may be below 915 mbar ( 27 @.@ 0 inHg ) , and that there may be other cyclones stronger than Ava .",

The pieces were performed in medleys , which were given generic track titles on the record , such as \" Prelude \" and \" Interlude \" . As with his other live releases in the 1970s , Davis refused to have individual compositions specified in the track listing because he felt critics and other listeners often overlooked the music 's intrinsic meaning by indulging in abstract musical analysis . \" I 'm not doing anything , it doesn 't need an explanation \" , Davis later told Leonard Feather . Music scholars were able to identify the pieces through an examination of what Davis researcher Enrico Merlin called \" coded phrases \" , which Davis played on trumpet or organ to signify the end of one segment and direct the band toward the next section .

  "Absorption filters dissipate the energy in unwanted frequencies internally as heat . This is in contrast to a conventional filter design where the unwanted frequencies are reflected back from the input port of the filter . Such filters are used where it is undesirable for power to be sent back towards the source . This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter . An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter spurious emissions such as harmonics or spurious sidebands . A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals . This design is known as a leaky @-@ wave filter . Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band . Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter . Higher frequencies in the unwanted band , however , readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed . These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave absorbent material . Another , more compact , design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric .",

  "A third significant feature in [ Rousseau ’ s ] La Nouvelle Heloise is that , just as we have passion in place of gallantry and inequality of station in place of similarity of rank , we have also the moral conviction of the sanctity of marriage in place of that honour grounded on aristocratic pride and self @-@ respect , which stood for virtue in fashionable literature . This word , Virtue , little in vogue until now , became with Rousseau and his school a watchword which was in perfect harmony with their other watchword , Nature ; for to Rousseau virtue was a natural condition . Following the example of society , French literature had been making merry at the expense of marriage ; Rousseau , therefore , defied the spirit of the times by writing a book in its honour . His heroine returns the passion of her lover , but marries another , to whom she remains faithful . Here , as in Werther the lover proper loses the maiden , who is wedded to a Monsieur Wolmar ( the Albert of Werther and the Edward of Kierkegaard 's Diary of a Seducer ) , a man as irreproachable as he is uninteresting . The moral conviction which is vindicated and glorified in Rousseau as Virtue , is the same as that which in Chateaubriand , under the influence of the religious reaction , takes the form of a binding religious vow .

  "Tite and Cubitt 's design was based around a three @-@ storey main building , separated from the LSWR 's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC 's twin rail lines . The private access road was intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly , and to avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road . The ground floor contained a grand entrance hall and staircase for mourners attending first and second class funerals , a smaller entrance hall and staircase for those attending lower classes of funeral , and two mortuaries which occupied the majority of the floor . A large room adjacent to the mortuary held a reserve stock of around 300 coffins . Most mourners would have commissioned their own coffins , or used coffins bought by the deceased during their lifetime but , explained an official of the LNC ( in 1898 ) the reserve of coffins was kept so that \" should a guest die in a hotel , and the landlord wished to keep it quiet , we are notified , and in the middle of the night we come for the corpse , and take it away in one of our ready @-@ made wooden overcoats \" .

  "Social structure most affects the novel 's themes by socially dividing different knowledge types that characters can access . In her book chapter exploring how literacy in different knowledge types affects the series , Alice Curry describes the factions , and character indoctrination in those factions , as deliberately creating knowledge gaps between initiates to different factions . Because of the initiation process , the characters become illiterate in the knowledge valued by the other factions . Tris 's \" divergence \" allows her to be successful because she can become literate in a broad set of knowledges and information types , and thus she becomes more admirable to the reader . Curry argues that Jeanine 's leadership within Erudite represents an academic \" Ivory Tower \" that alienates other types of knowledge , thus the book critiques academic learning , in favor of the broader literacy embodied by Tris . Curry compares the novel to Julie Bertagna 's 2002 Exodus , describing both as using spaces and landscapes where knowledge is learned to critique \" crumbling knowledge institutions \" , like academic spaces , that \" dissemble \" knowledge instead of facilitating deeper holistic knowledge literacies that create \" understanding \" .",

Teehan has uncovered evidence showing that \" Eight Miles High \" was already decelerating on the national charts before the end of April 1966 .

Brown simplified the long narrow stretch by sweeping it into a lawn that dropped right to the riverbank , stopped at each end by bold clumps of native trees . A serpentine drive gave an impression of greater distance between the front gates and the castle entrance .",

According to Yankovic , this is due to the fact there is a \" royalty ceiling \" on the albums and he needed to pick one song to cut from the list in order to turn a profit on the album . \" Girls Just Want to Have Lunch \" was chosen due to Yankovic 's personal dislike of the song , as his record label had forced him to record it in order to release Dare to Be Stupid back in 1985 . Also absent from the release is \" Waffle King . \" The song had originally been recorded for Off the Deep End . However , Yankovic decided to swap \" Waffle King \" with \" I Was Only Kidding \" — a song he had actually recorded for his next album — at the last minute ; this forced Yankovic to shelve \" Waffle King \" for the time being . The song was later released on \" Smells Like Nirvana \" single , as well as Yankovic 's eighth studio album , Alapalooza , which was released four months after The Food Album .",

  "When the U.S. entered World War I on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917 , the war at sea was hanging in the balance . Having resumed unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917 , Germany had quickly inflicted staggering losses on the British merchant marine to an extent completely unknown to the American government , or indeed to anyone but a select few at the British Admiralty . At the first meeting between representatives of the two navies in April 1917 , the British First Sea Lord — Admiral Sir John Jellicoe — had astonished the new American naval envoy — Rear Admiral William S. Sims — by informing him that Allied shipping loses had recently surpassed 600 @,@ 000 long tons ( 610 @,@ 000 t ) per month , and that the Admiralty did not see any immediate solution to the problem .",

She was requisitioned from Norway at the beginning of World War I , but was not completed until 1918 although she had been launched over three years earlier . On 16 September 1918 , before she had even gone into action , she suffered a large fire in one of her 6 @-@ inch magazines , and had to be scuttled to prevent an explosion of her main magazines that would have devastated Dover . Her wreck was partially salvaged in 1926 , and moved into a position in the northeastern end of the harbour where it would not obstruct traffic .

The cause of the war is the nation 's crystals , objects of magical and political power that bestow different blessings on each nation , and choose people to become magical warriors known as l 'Cie , which serve and protect their respective crystal . The land of Orience is locked in a stable time loop , whereby events repeat constantly , then reset and begin all over again with minor variations .

  "All of the captured Dutch ships were bought into the Royal Navy , Gleijkheid , Vrijheid , Wassenaar , Haarlem and Alkmaar under their own names ( although in most cases they were anglicised ) and Admiraal Tjerk Hiddes De Vries as the simpler Devries . Two were completely renamed , due to the prior existence of ships with their names in the Royal Navy ; Jupiter became HMS Camperdown and Hercules became HMS Delft . None of these ships was ever in sufficient condition for service in open waters : the damage suffered at Camperdown proved too severe for them to be fully repaired . In addition , ships of Dutch construction had lighter hulls and flatter bottoms than ships of other nations as they were designed to operate off the shallow waters of the Dutch coast , and as a result they were of little use to the ocean @-@ going Royal Navy . All the prizes were immediately relegated to harbour duty , and none were used for front @-@ line service . Although the prize court took several years to determine the prize money that would be awarded for the battle , the initial estimates of £ 60 @,@ 000 ( the equivalent of £ 5 @,@ 604 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) proved pessimistic : Duncan and his men were eventually awarded £ 150 @,@ 000 ( the equivalent of £ 14 @,@ 010 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) , although they were forced to defend a claim from the Russian Navy on behalf of the squadron that had reinforced Duncan in May .

Following the award of the first £ 10 @,@ 000 instalment , Duncan was given the unique honour of permission to buy shares on the London Stock Exchange at ⅞ market price .",

In public , Lewis initially had negative feedback from older viewers because they felt Geoff was better suited to Melody . He revealed they felt like she was a bad influence for Geoff because she often played games .
