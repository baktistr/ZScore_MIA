Four to eight QF 20 mm Oerlikon cannons were added to the surviving ships , usually replacing the .50 @-@ calibre machine gun mounts between the funnels . One pair of these was added to the bridge wings and the other pair was mounted abreast the searchlight platform . Early in the war , depth charge stowage increased to 44 . By 1943 , only four ships were still afloat and all had the ' Y ' gun on the quarterdeck removed to allow for additional depth charge stowage and two additional depth charge throwers . The 12 @-@ pounder was removed to allow for the installation of a Huff @-@ Duff radio direction finder on a short mainmast and for more depth charges . All of the survivors , except Garland , had ' A ' or ' B ' gun replaced by a Hedgehog anti @-@ submarine spigot mortar , and their director @-@ control tower and rangefinder above the bridge removed in exchange for a Type 271 target @-@ indication radar . ' A ' gun was later replaced in Hotspur while Hero had exchanged ' B ' gun for a Hedgehog and a twin @-@ gun mount for QF six @-@ pounder Hotchkiss guns for use against U @-@ boats at very close range . A Type 286 short @-@ range , surface @-@ search radar , adapted from the Royal Air Force 's ASV radar , was also added .

  "John Latham wrote about the bird found in Calcutta based on descriptions in Ives 's Voyage to India published in 1773 and included an illustration in the first supplement to his General Synopsis of Birds . The illustration was based on a drawing in Lady Impey 's collection and Latham called it the gigantic crane and included observations by an African traveller named Smeathman who described a similar bird from western Africa . Johann Friedrich Gmelin used Latham 's description and described the Indian bird as Ardea dubia in 1789 while Latham later used the name Ardea argala for the Indian bird . Temminck used the name Ciconia marabou in 1824 based on the local name used in Senegal for the African bird and this was also applied to the Indian species . This led to considerable confusion between the African and Indian species . The marabou stork of Africa looks somewhat similar but their disjunct distribution ranges , differences in bill structure , plumage , and display behaviour support their treatment as separate species .",

  "Civic and private memorials in response to the war took many forms , from monuments , sculpture , buildings , gardens , artistic works or special funds to support particular activities . One of the major distinctions between proposed war memorials involved a distinction between utilitarian and non @-@ utilitarian , symbolic designs ; in the US , utilitarian memorials were termed \" living memorials \" . Utilitarian memorials were intended to commemorate the dead by having a practical function and typically include projects such as libraries , small hospitals , cottages for nursing staff , parks , clock towers or bowling greens , although in Britain and Canada , large @-@ scale urban redevelopment projects were also proposed , including rebuilding the centre of Westminster , to form a huge war memorial complex and building a subway under the Detroit River .

  "Vaccination is a cheap and effective way of preventing infections by viruses . Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before the discovery of the actual viruses . Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity ( illness ) and mortality ( death ) associated with viral infections such as polio , measles , mumps and rubella . Smallpox infections have been eradicated . Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans , and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals . Vaccines can consist of live @-@ attenuated or killed viruses , or viral proteins ( antigens ) . Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus , which do not cause the disease but , nonetheless , confer immunity . Such viruses are called attenuated . Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity ( who are described as immunocompromised ) , because in these people , the weakened virus can cause the original disease . Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines . These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus . Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type of vaccine . Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease . The yellow fever virus vaccine , a live @-@ attenuated strain called 17D , is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated .",

  "As a form of express trust , charitable trusts are subject to certain formalities , as well as the requirements of the three certainties , when being created . These vary depending on whether the gift that creates the trust is given in life , given after death , or includes land . If the gift is given after death through a will , the will must comply with Section 9 of the Wills Act 1837 , which requires that the will be in writing and signed by the testator ( or somebody else present , at the testator 's instruction ) , it is clear that the testator intended to give effect to the will , and the signature is made or noted by two or more witnesses . If these are all carried out , the will is a valid document , and the gift made as part of it can create a charitable trust . If the gift is of land and made during the donor 's lifetime , it must comply with Section 53 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Law of Property Act 1925 , which requires that the agreement be a written document signed by the person giving it . If the gift is of personal property and made inter vivos , there are no formal requirements ; it is enough that an oral declaration is made creating the trust .

  "A tropical wave developed into a tropical depression near the Yucatan Peninsula on September 15 . It quickly entered the Gulf of Mexico and turned westward . As the depression was curving southwestward on September 16 , it strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Henri . Thereafter , Henri decelerated and continued to intensify , becoming a hurricane on September 17 . Later that day , as it was turning northwestward , the hurricane peaked with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983 mbar ( 29 @.@ 0 inHg ) . A nearby low pressure area caused Henri to move erratically . Henri began weakening due to land interaction with Mexico and it was downgraded back to a tropical storm on September 18 .",

  "In Paradisi in Sole Parkinson hinted that he hoped to add a fourth section , a garden of simples ( medicinal herbs ) . He delivered the promise in his other great book , the monumental Theatrum Botanicum ( The Botanical Theatre or Theatre of Plants ) which he published in 1640 at the age of 73 years . The release of this work was delayed due to the popularity of Thomas Johnson 's edition of John Gerard 's book The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes ( 1597 ) . Theatrum Botanicum , with 1 @,@ 688 pages of text , describes over 3 @,@ 800 plants and was the most complete and beautifully presented English treatise on plants of its day .

Some of these plants , such as the Welsh poppy , the Strawberry Tree and the Lady 's Slipper , were very common but had gone unnoticed or at least unrecorded . He intended the book to be a reliable guide for apothecaries , and it remained so for more than a hundred years after his death . Parkinson presented the work to Charles I , who conferred on him the title \" Botanicus Regis Primarius \" ( \" Royal Botanist of the First Rank \" ) though this came without a salary .",

  "The twelve 45 @-@ calibre 14 @-@ inch guns of the Fusō class were mounted in six twin @-@ gun turrets , numbered from front to rear , each of which weighed 615 long tons ( 625 t ) .

They were arranged in an uncommon 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 1 @-@ 2 style with superfiring pairs of turrets fore and aft ; the middle turrets were not superfiring , and had a funnel between them . The decision to use six twin turrets rather than four triple turrets greatly affected the entire design of the class because the two extra turrets required a longer ship and increased the amount of armor required to protect the ship . The location of the third and fourth turrets proved particularly problematic to the design of the class because the amidships turrets were not superfiring as in the subsequent Ise @-@ class battleships . This further increased the length of the ships because the barrels of the upper turret did not protrude over the lower turret , requiring more space than a pair of superfiring turrets . Mounted amidships along the centerline of the ship , they had restricted arcs of fire , and their position forced the boiler rooms to be placed in less than ideal locations . Another complication was the need to fit extra insulation and air conditioning in the magazines of the amidships turrets to protect them from the heat generated in the adjacent boiler rooms . Originally both amidship gun turrets faced to the rear , but Fusō 's turret No. 3 was moved to face forward during her reconstruction in order to accommodate additional platforms around her funnel .",

It is in Radcliffe @-@ Brown 's specific usage that the prefix ' structural ' emerged .

  "Waddington first played for Yorkshire after the First World War , when the team had been weakened by injuries and retirements . He made an immediate impression in 1919 , his first season ; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire 's victory in the County Championship that year . After a similarly successful season in 1920 , he was selected for the 1920 – 21 Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) tour of Australia , during which he appeared in two of the five Tests . However , the England team were outclassed ; used in an unfamiliar tactical role , Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again . He continued to be effective for Yorkshire , particularly against the weaker counties , but was often inconsistent . His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against Middlesex . A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first @-@ class cricket in 1927 . He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family business , a fat @-@ refining firm , but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket .",

  "Wheels are poor at dealing with vertical obstacles , especially obstacles on the same scale as the wheel itself . Assuming a vehicle or animal can shift its center of mass , the limiting height of vertical obstacles for a passive wheel is equal to the radius of the wheel . If the center of mass cannot be shifted , the highest obstacle a vehicle can surmount is one quarter to one half the radius of the wheel . Because of these limitations , wheels intended for rough terrain require a larger diameter .",
  "By 1892 , Mogadishu was under the joint control of the Somali Sultanate of the Geledi and the Omani Sultanate of Zanzibar . The Geledi Sultans were at the height of their power . They dominated the southern ivory trade , and also held sway over the Jubba and Shebelle valleys in the hinterland . The Omani Sultans ' authority in Mogadishu , however , was largely nominal . When Imam Azzan bin Qais of Oman sought to build a fort in the city , he was thus obligated to request permission from Sultan Ahmed Yusuf of Geledi . This Fort of Garessa was eventually constructed in 1870 . The Sultan of Zanzibar later leased and then sold the infrastructure that he had built to the Italians , but not the land itself , which was Somali owned .",

  "The track had been patched up prior to the weekend 's racing using a synthetic rubber compound , and it had remained secure throughout the practice and qualifying sessions , as well as the Grand @-@ Am and Indy Lights races . However , the Dallara DW12 's aerodynamic ground force effects acted to pull the compound out .

On 20 September 1966 , Irvine scored the sole Burnley goal in the 1 – 1 draw against German side VfB Stuttgart . The following month , he scored in consecutive league matches against Leicester City and Manchester City at Turf Moor . Irvine was on the scoresheet again in the next round of the Fairs Cup as Swiss team Lausanne Sports were beaten 5 – 0 in Burnley on 25 October 1966 . By the middle of the season , Irvine had scored 13 goals in the league , four fewer than the same stage of the previous campaign . He scored his first goal of the new year on 31 January 1967 in the FA Cup third round replay against Everton at Goodison Park . However , early in the second half , Irvine was tackled by Everton defender Johnny Morrissey . The challenge — not deemed a foul by the referee — broke his shin bone , and Irvine was immediately substituted and replaced by fellow Irishman Sammy Todd . The injury meant that he did not play again for Burnley for the remainder of the season . He was forced to remain on the sidelines as Burnley finished 14th in the First Division and reached the fourth round of the Fairs Cup before being knocked out by Eintracht Frankfurt .",

  "The Cunningham – Rawnsley team used the AI specifically to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy . Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner , it was difficult to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape . Usually the blackness of the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter . As they approached , the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous ; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim . Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream . The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first , which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully . Bob Braham , a rival night fighter ace , also used this tactic .",

The press called it an even matchup in all positions , even at center , where Bill Russell was expected to give Chamberlain a tough battle . Indeed , the two teams split the first six games , and because of the better season record , the last game was held in the Celtics ' Boston Garden . In that Game 7 , both centers were marvelous : Chamberlain scored 30 points and 32 rebounds , and Russell logged 16 points , 27 rebounds and eight assists . In the final minute , Chamberlain hit two clutch free throws and slam dunked on Russell , bringing Boston 's lead down to 110 – 109 with five seconds left . Russell botched the inbounds pass , hitting a guy @-@ wire over the backboard and giving the ball back to the Sixers . Coach Schayes called timeout , and decided to run the last play over Hal Greer rather than Chamberlain , because he feared the Celtics would intentionally foul him because he was a poor foul shooter .

According to Chamberlain , that was the time that people started calling him \" loser \" . Additionally , in an April 1965 issue of Sports Illustrated Chamberlain conducted an interview entitled \" My Life in a Bush League \" where he criticized his fellow players , coaches , and NBA administrators . Chamberlain later commented that he could see in hindsight how the interview was instrumental in damaging his public image .",

  "Females are sexually mature at 15 – 36 months and males at 4 – 5 years . Mating may occur anytime after reaching sexual maturity , but is mostly seen in the rainy season . In Zambia , young are born in July and August , while elsewhere it is the mating season . Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush green plains with plentiful grass , and some males and females start mating with each other in separate pairs . Males chase the females to find out if they are in estrus . They also test the female 's urine . Usually , a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with . Sometimes she runs away from males trying to mate , causing more attraction . This results in fights between males , in which their hard horns are used . It is 2 – 4 hours before a female allows a male to mount . Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period . The dominant male can mate with more than one female . Females have a gestation period of 9 months , and give birth to only one calf each time .",

  "Less than three days after the disaster , a contract was signed for the ship to be raised . However , those efforts were unsuccessful . The earliest attempts at raising Vasa by English engineer Ian Bulmer , resulted in righting the ship but also got it more securely stuck in the mud and was most likely one of the biggest impediments to the earliest attempts at recovery . Salvaging technology in the early 17th century was much more primitive than today , but the recovery of ships used roughly the same principles as were used to raise Vasa more than 300 years later . Two ships or hulks were placed parallel to either side above the wreck , and ropes attached to several anchors were sent down and hooked to the ship . The two hulks were filled with as much water as was safe , the ropes tightened , and the water pumped out . The sunken ship then rose with the ships on the surface and could be towed to shallower waters . The process was then repeated until the entire ship was successfully raised above water level . Even if the underwater weight of Vasa was not great , the mud in which it had settled made it sit more secure on the bottom and required considerable lifting power to overcome . More than 30 years after the ship 's sinking , in 1663 – 1665 , Albreckt von Treileben and Andreas Peckell mounted an effort to recover the valuable guns .

  "A neurolytic block is the deliberate injury of a nerve by the application of chemicals ( in which case the procedure is called \" neurolysis \" ) or physical agents such as freezing or heating ( \" neurotomy \" ) . These interventions cause degeneration of the nerve 's fibers and temporary interference with the transmission of pain signals . In these procedures , the thin protective layer around the nerve fiber , the basal lamina , is preserved so that , as a damaged fiber regrows , it travels within its basal lamina tube and connects with the correct loose end , and function may be restored . Surgically cutting a nerve severs these basal lamina tubes , and without them to channel the regrowing fibers to their lost connections , a painful neuroma or deafferentation pain may develop . This is why the neurolytic is preferred over the surgical block .",

  "In the past , the forecaster was responsible for generating the entire weather forecast based upon available observations . Today , meteorologists ' input is generally confined to choosing a model based on various parameters , such as model biases and performance . Using a consensus of forecast models , as well as ensemble members of the various models , can help reduce forecast error . However , regardless how small the average error becomes with any individual system , large errors within any particularly piece of guidance are still possible on any given model run . Professionals are required to interpret the model data into weather forecasts that are understandable to the lay person . Professionals can use knowledge of local effects which may be too small in size to be resolved by the model to add information to the forecast . As an example , terrain is considered in the QPF process by using topography or climatological precipitation patterns from observations with fine detail . Using model guidance and comparing the various forecast fields to climatology , extreme events such as excessive precipitation associated with later flood events lead to better forecasts . While increasing accuracy of forecast models implies that humans may no longer be needed in the forecast process at some point in the future , there is currently still a need for human intervention .",

  "Ely had until 1109 been an independent monastery , but its last abbot , Richard , had proposed to the king a plan by which the abbey would become a bishopric , presumably with the abbot himself as bishop . Richard died before the proposal could be put into operation , but in 1109 , the custodian of the vacant abbey secured permission to make the change , and became the first Bishop of Ely . However , the administrative changes needed to make the abbey into a bishopric took longer , and were still unresolved at the time of Nigel 's appointment . Regardless , Nigel was constantly at court , as shown by his appearance 31 times as a witness to charters during the last 10 years of Henry I 's reign . This left little time for administration of his diocese , and Nigel appointed a married clergyman , Ranulf of Salisbury , to administer the diocese . Ranulf seems to have tyrannized the monks of the cathedral chapter , and Nigel appears to have done little to protect his monks from abuse . Later , during the early years of Stephen 's reign , Nigel claimed to have uncovered a plot led by Ranulf to assassinate Normans . The exact nature of the conspiracy is obscure , and it is unclear what prompted it . The medieval chronicler Orderic Vitalis claimed that Ranulf planned to kill all the Normans in the government and hand the country over to the Scots . After the discovery of the plot , Ranulf fled the country and Nigel made peace with the monks of his cathedral chapter . Another source of conflict with his monks was the desire of the cathedral chapter to enjoy the same \" liberty \" as a corporate body that the bishops did in the diocese . This liberty was a group of rights that the abbey had originally held , and had transferred to the bishop when the abbey became a bishopric . The rights included sake and soke , or the right to command dues from the land , and the right to levy tolls . They also included the right to hold courts dealing with theft . Around 1135 , Nigel conceded this point to the monks . Although he restored some of the lands that had been taken from the monks by Ranulf , the Liber Eliensis ( the house chronicle of the monks of Ely ) continued to decry his administration of the diocese and the lands of the cathedral chapter , alleging that \" he kept back for himself some properties of the church which he wanted , and very good ones they were \" . The chronicle contains a number of complaints that Nigel oppressed the monks or despoiled them .",

First , Justice Matthews had noted that under Cherokee Nation v. Georgia , ( 1831 ) the Brulé tribe had a right to its own law in Indian country . Part of this ruling was based on American constitutional tradition – at that time , Indians were not U.S. citizens and according to Matthews did not have a \" voice in the selection of representatives and the framing of the laws . \" The case held that Indian tribes retain sovereignty , and is still valid law .

Ní Chiosáin ( 1991 : 188 – 95 ) argues that the triggering consonant is underlyingly associated with a unit of syllable weight called a mora ; this mora then shifts to the vowel , creating a long vowel or a diphthong . Carnie ( 2002 ) expands on that analysis to argue that the fortis sonorants have an advanced tongue root ( that is , the bottom of the tongue is pushed upward during articulation of the consonant ) and that diphthongization is an articulatory effect of this tongue movement .",

  "Within the brain , dopamine functions partly as a \" global reward signal \" , where an initial phasic dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about the salience , value , and context of a reward . In the context of reward @-@ related learning , dopamine also functions as a reward prediction error signal , that is , the degree to which the value of a reward is unexpected . According to this hypothesis of Wolfram Schultz , rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells , but rewards that are unexpected , or greater than expected , produce a short @-@ lasting increase in synaptic dopamine , whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level .

  "This brings the issue of the mysterious origin of the Wielbark culture , and why it so immediately replaced the Oksywie culture . According to the legend quoted in The Origin and Deeds of the Goths by the 6th century Gothic historian Jordanes , the ancestors of that Germanic tribe arrived from Scandinavia ( under King Berig ) in two boatloads and landed on the South Baltic shores , followed by a third boat carrying the ancestors of the Gepids . Supposedly they conquered the native people of that region , and then , some years later ( under King Filimer , the fifth one counting from Berig ) , continued their migration toward the Black Sea . This story , in the past dismissed , is now seen as containing basic elements of the true sequence of events and the Wielbark culture is in part identified with Germanic ancestors of the Goths indeed . The idea of an arrival in the mouth of the Vistula region of culturally different ( although related ) people , who mixed with the Oksywie culture population , and being more advanced possibly dominated it ( at least culturally ) to some degree , is not at odds with the state of archeological findings and may explain the change of cultures in Pomerania around 30 AD .",

In 1988 , American palaeontologist Gregory S.

  "On 18 September 1942 , Pius XII received a letter from Monsignor Montini ( future Pope Paul VI ) , saying , \" the massacres of the Jews reach frightening proportions and forms . \" Later that month , Myron Taylor , U.S. representative to the Vatican , warned Pius that the Vatican 's \" moral prestige \" was being injured by silence on European atrocities , a warning which was echoed simultaneously by representatives from the United Kingdom , Brazil , Uruguay , Belgium , and Poland . Myron C. Taylor passed a US Government memorandum to Pius on 26 September 1942 , outlining intelligence received from the Jewish Agency for Palestine which said that Jews from across the Nazi Empire were being systematically \" butchered \" . Taylor asked if the Vatican might have any information which might \" tend to confirm the reports \" , and if so , what the Pope might be able to do to influence public opinion against the \" barbarities \" . Cardinal Maglione handed Harold Tittmann a response to the letter on 10 October . The note thanked Washington for passing on the intelligence , and confirmed that reports of severe measures against the Jews had reached the Vatican from other sources , though it had not been possible to \" verify their accuracy \" . Nevertheless , \" every opportunity is being taken by the Holy See , however , to mitigate the suffering of these unfortunate people \" . In December 1942 , when Tittmann asked Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione if Pius would issue a proclamation similar to the Allied declaration \" German Policy of Extermination of the Jewish Race \" , Maglione replied that the Vatican was \" unable to denounce publicly particular atrocities . \" Pius XII directly explained to Tittman that he could not name the Nazis without at the same time mentioning the Bolsheviks .",

As a marsupial , it was not closely related to these placental mammals , but because of convergent evolution it displayed the same general form and adaptations .

The thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes ( the other being the water opossum ) . The male thylacine had a pouch that acted as a protective sheath , covering his external reproductive organs while he ran through thick brush . The thylacine has been described as a formidable predator because of its ability to survive and hunt prey in extremely sparsely populated areas .",

  "Typically , as a dead body decomposes , body tissues become depleted of oxygen and the body begins to putrefy ; anaerobic bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract proliferate and as a result of increased metabolic activity , release gases such as carbon dioxide , methane , and hydrogen sulfide . These bacteria secrete exoenzymesNote c to break down body cells and proteins for ingestion which thus weakens organ tissues . Increasing pressure forces the diffusion of excessive gases into the weakened tissues where they enter the circulatory system and spread to other parts of the body , causing both torso and limbs to become bloated . These decompositional processes weaken the structural integrity of organs by separating necrotizing tissue layers . Bloating usually begins from two to five days after death , depending on external temperature , humidity , and other environmental conditions . As the volume of gas increases , the pressure begins to force various body fluids to exude from all natural orifices . It is at this point during the decomposition of a pregnant body that amniotic membranes become stretched and separated , and intraabdominal gas pressure may force the eversion and prolapse of the uterus , Note d which would result in the expulsion of the fetus through the vaginal canal . It has been observed that the bodies of multiparous womenNote e are more likely to spontaneously expel the fetus during decomposition than those who died during their first pregnancy , because of the more elastic nature of the cervix .",

  "The tactical decision that precedes almost every play in a baseball game involves pitch selection . By gripping and then releasing the baseball in a certain manner , and by throwing it at a certain speed , pitchers can cause the baseball to break to either side , or downward , as it approaches the batter . Among the resulting wide variety of pitches that may be thrown , the four basic types are the fastball , the changeup ( or off @-@ speed pitch ) , and two breaking balls — the curveball and the slider . Pitchers have different repertoires of pitches they are skillful at throwing . Conventionally , before each pitch , the catcher signals the pitcher what type of pitch to throw , as well as its general vertical and / or horizontal location . If there is disagreement on the selection , the pitcher may shake off the sign and the catcher will call for a different pitch . With a runner on base and taking a lead , the pitcher may attempt a pickoff , a quick throw to a fielder covering the base to keep the runner 's lead in check or , optimally , effect a tag out . Pickoff attempts , however , are subject to rules that severely restrict the pitcher 's movements before and during the pickoff attempt . Violation of any one of these rules could result in the umpire calling a balk against the pitcher , with the result being runners on base , if any , advance one base with impunity . If an attempted stolen base is anticipated , the catcher may call for a pitchout , a ball thrown deliberately off the plate , allowing the catcher to catch it while standing and throw quickly to a base . Facing a batter with a strong tendency to hit to one side of the field , the fielding team may employ a shift , with most or all of the fielders moving to the left or right of their usual positions . With a runner on third base , the infielders may play in , moving closer to home plate to improve the odds of throwing out the runner on a ground ball , though a sharply hit grounder is more likely to carry through a drawn @-@ in infield .",

Prefects and frightened local councils bombarded Rome with requests for the immediate suppression of the Fasci . Despite the heavy pressure from the King , the army and conservative circles in Rome , however , Giolitti would neither treat strikes – which were not illegal – as a crime nor dissolve the Fasci nor authorise the use of firearms against popular demonstrations . His policy was “ to allow these economic struggles to resolve themselves through amelioration of the condition of the workers ” and not to interfere in the process .",

  "In contrast to the early 1990s productions , the mid @-@ 1990s Disney animated features presented a trend of diminishing returns . Pocahontas , released in summer 1995 , was a critical and commercial disappointment compared to its predecessors , earning $ 346 million worldwide while still winning two Academy Awards for its music by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz . The next film , The Hunchback of Notre Dame ( 1996 ) , partially produced at the Paris studio , performed better critically but grossed only $ 325 million worldwide . The following summer , Hercules , grossed only $ 252 million worldwide and received positive reviews , but it was responsible for beginning the decline of traditional animated films . The declining box office success became doubly concerning inside the studio as wage competition from DreamWorks had significantly increased the studio 's overhead , with production costs increasing from $ 79 million in total costs ( production , marketing , and overhead ) for The Lion King in 1994 to $ 179 million for Hercules three years later .

  "The southern black bream is one of the most important species to the commercial fisheries in both Victoria and southern Western Australia , although only small numbers are harvested in South Australian waters due to the lower populations . Victoria produces the majority of the catch , with the Gippsland region alone producing 80 % of the state 's haul . A. butcheri has been taken from the Gippsland Lakes since the 1880s when they were the predominantly targeted species , although during the 1920s mullet became the most frequently caught species in the lakes . The bream catch from the lakes now fluctuates between 200 and 400 tonnes per year . The Mallacoota inlet and Lake Tyers make up the other important bream @-@ producing regions of the state . In South Australia , bream are only commercially taken from the Coorong which has yielded 10 to 70 tonnes of the species per year since the 1970s . In lower Western Australia the Culham and Stokes inlet produce the bulk of the state 's catch , with annual hauls far greater now than during the early 1990s . During the 1970s and 1980s , Western Australia had a modest bream catch of around 26 tonnes per year , a figure which rocketed to 103 @.@ 9 tonnes in the 1992 / 3 season before receding to around 28 tonnes per year since 2000 .

  "Termites can be major agricultural pests , particularly in East Africa and North Asia , where crop losses can be severe ( 3 – 100 % in crop loss in Africa ) . Counterbalancing this is the greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply , which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation . In South America , cultivated plants such as eucalyptus , upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations , with attacks on leaves , roots and woody tissue . Termites can also attack other plants , including cassava , coffee , cotton , fruit trees , maize , peanuts , soybeans and vegetables . Mounds can disrupt farming activities , making it difficult for farmers to operate farming machinery ; however , despite farmers ' dislike of the mounds , it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs . Termites can be beneficial to agriculture , such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil . Termites and ants can re @-@ colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble , which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests . The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil , both essential for the growth of crops .",

  "Aircraft from the light carrier Independence were able to track the Japanese ships for most of the night and Halsey ordered an air strike of 60 Hellcat fighters , 65 Helldiver dive bombers and 55 Avenger torpedo bombers launched shortly after dawn in anticipation of locating the Japanese fleet .

The 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb started several small fires , lifted the rear elevator , bulged the flight deck , knocked out steering and gave the ship a small list to port . Twenty minutes later , the fires were put out , steering repaired and the list corrected . A second attack an hour later focused on Chiyoda and ignored Zuihō . The third wave arrived around 1300 and badly damaged the ship . She was hit once by a torpedo and twice by small bombs , although fragments from as many as 67 near misses cut steam pipes and caused flooding of both engine rooms and one boiler room . Zuihō was forced to reduce speed to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) and flooding increased so that all available hands were ordered to man the pumps at 14 : 10 .

  "Betjeman characterised Heber 's style as consciously literary , with careful choices of adjectives and vivid figures of speech : \" poetic imagery was as important as didactic truth \" . A more recent analysis by J. R. Watson draws attention to Heber 's tendency to deliver what he terms \" a rather obvious sermon \" , and to his mixing of powerful description with \" a rather trite moralism \" . A handful of Heber 's hymns have survived into popular use into the 21st century . One whose popularity has waned is the missionary hymn \" From Greenland 's Icy Mountains \" , written in 1819 as part of a country @-@ wide campaign on behalf of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel ( SPG ) . Watson describes this as \" a conspicuous example of that fervent belief to convert the world to Christianity which led Heber and others to lay down their lives in the mission field \" , and while widely sung until the second half of the 20th century , it was for instance omitted from the 1982 revision of the Episcopal Church hymnal . Betjeman felt that in the modern world , the words of this hymn seem patronising and insensitive to other beliefs , with references to \" ... every prospect pleases and only man is vile \" , and to \" the heathen in his blindness [ bowing ] down to wood and stone \" . These phrases and the assumptions behind them offended Gandhi , who drew attention to them in a speech to the YMCA in Calcutta ( Kolkata ) in 1925 : \" My own experience in my travels throughout India has been to the contrary ... [ Man ] is not vile . He is as much a seeker after truth as you and I are , possibly more so \" .

  "Today , the NFL is considered the most popular sports league in North America ; much of its growth is attributed to former Commissioner Pete Rozelle , who led the league from 1960 to 1989 . Overall annual attendance increased from three million at the beginning of his tenure to seventeen million by the end of his tenure , and 400 million viewers watched 1989 's Super Bowl XXIII . The NFL established NFL Properties in 1963 .

Ash flow sheets constitute as much as 40 percent of the area 's total erupted material , suggesting that pyroclastic eruptions were rather important during this time . By examining the eruption rate of individual volcanoes , Hildreth et al. concluded that similar amounts of ash @-@ flow volcanism took place in the southern sector as well . Their study established that in particular silicic ash was missing from the record , and concluded that erosion had probably disrupted deposition of volcaniclastic rock .",

  "Eric Johnson , after auditioning for the roles of Lex and Clark , was cast as Lana Lang 's boyfriend Whitney Fordman . Johnson only spent one day filming his scenes for the pilot . Allison Mack toyed with the idea of auditioning for the role of Lana Lang but chose instead to audition for the role of Chloe Sullivan . The character was created just for the series and was intended to add ethnic diversity to the cast , but part of the reason Gough and Millar chose to cast Mack , against their initial intentions to give the character an ethnic background , was because they were impressed with Allison Mack 's \" rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary [ sic ] dialogue conversationally \" .

  "The Euclidean algorithm has many theoretical and practical applications . It is used for reducing fractions to their simplest form and for performing division in modular arithmetic . Computations using this algorithm form part of the cryptographic protocols that are used to secure internet communications , and in methods for breaking these cryptosystems by factoring large composite numbers . The Euclidean algorithm may be used to solve Diophantine equations , such as finding numbers that satisfy multiple congruences according to the Chinese remainder theorem , to construct continued fractions , and to find accurate rational approximations to real numbers . Finally , it can be used as a basic tool for proving theorems in number theory such as Lagrange 's four @-@ square theorem and the uniqueness of prime factorizations . The original algorithm was described only for natural numbers and geometric lengths ( real numbers ) , but the algorithm was generalized in the 19th century to other types of numbers , such as Gaussian integers and polynomials of one variable . This led to modern abstract algebraic notions such as Euclidean domains .",
  "Levels in each chapter can be played in any order , but a certain number of levels need to be completed to access the boss stage , which unlocks the next chapter if cleared . The player has an unlimited number of attempts to complete each level . If Meat Boy is killed , he immediately restarts the level , though the ornamental red meat juice left behind on surfaces that the player has touched remains . A replay function , which may be accessed after a level is completed , simultaneously shows all the player 's attempts to complete the level . Completing a level within a certain time earns an \" A + \" grade , which unlocks a harder alternate version of the level in the \" dark world \" , an optional set of especially difficult levels . Hidden stages called warp zones are accessed by finding portals in specific levels . These warp zones feature bonus levels that have either the art style of older video games and a limit of three lives , or are patterned after another indie video game such as Castle Crashers or Braid . The player may control characters other than Meat Boy , many of whom first appeared in other independent video games . Each character has different attributes , such as Commander Video 's ability to momentarily float in midair . These characters can be unlocked by collecting bandage items placed throughout the game 's levels or completing certain warp zones . Some bandages can only be collected by using certain characters .

  "Children use words differently for objects , spatial relations and actions . Children ages one to three often rely on general purpose deictic words such as \" here \" , \" that \" or \" look \" accompanied by a gesture , which is most often pointing , to pick out specific objects . Children also stretch already known or partly known words to cover other objects that appear similar to the original . This can result in word overextension or misuses of words . Word overextension is governed by the perceptual similarities children notice among the different referents . Misuses of words indirectly provide ways of finding out which meanings children have attached to particular words . When children come into contact with spatial relations , they talk about the location of one object with respect to another . They name the object located and use a deictic term , such as here or \" there \" for location , or they name both the object located and its location . They can also use a general purpose locative marker , which is a preposition , postposition or suffix depending on the language that is linked in some way to the word for location . Children 's earliest words for actions usually encode both the action and its result . Children use a small number of general purpose verbs , such as \" do \" and \" make \" for a large variety of actions because their resources are limited . Children acquiring a second language seem to use the same production strategies for talking about actions . Sometimes children use a highly specific verb instead of a general purpose verb .

  "Theodore 's brother Manuel , who managed to escape from Klokotnitsa , now took over the throne in Thessalonica . His domain was reduced to the environs of the city and his family 's core territories in Epirus and Thessaly , as well as Dyrrhachium and Corfu , while his brother Constantine in Aetolia and Acarnania recognized his suzerainty . As a son @-@ in @-@ law of John Asen , Manuel was allowed to maintain internal autonomy , but to all intents and purposes he was a client of the Bulgarian Tsar . At about the same time , Michael I 's bastard son Michael II returned from exile and quickly succeeded , apparently with the support of the local population , in taking over control of Epirus . Manuel was forced to recognize the fait accompli under the pretense that Michael recognized his suzerainty , in token of which Manuel conferred him the title of Despot . In reality Michael was fully independent , and very quickly ceased to acknowledge Manuel 's suzerainty ; by 1236 , he had seized Corfu . In order to preserve some freedom of manoeuvre and counter Asen 's attempts to subordinate the Epirote Church to the Bulgarian Church of Tarnovo , Manuel turned to his brother 's erstwhile rivals in Nicaea and brought an end to the ecclesiastical schism by acknowledging the legitimacy and superiority of the Nicaea @-@ based Patriarch .",
  "\" Rock Show \" , along with the five other first season episodes of Parks and Recreation , was released on a one @-@ disc DVD set in the United States on September 8 , 2009 . The DVD included cast and crew commentary tracks for each episode , as well as about 30 minutes of deleted scenes . The disc also included an \" Producer 's Extended Cut \" of \" Rock Show \" , which incorporated scenes that were cut from the originally broadcast episode . Many of the deleted scenes were improvised dialogue from the actors in brief extensions of episodes already included in the originally broadcast episode . In one of the cut scenes , Marlene Knope tells the audience that Leslie 's business meeting is actually a date . The producers decided to cut the moment , so the audience would find out at the same time Leslie learns it . In another cut scene , Andy tries to convince Ann that the doctor lied to her about Andy requesting more time with the leg casts because the doctor wanted more money . One of the longest cut scenes from the extended edition was a conversation between Leslie and Mark at the bar , in which Mark explains his ideals about city planning when he attended college are much different than the practical , technical aspects of his job . Although the scene was cut , Michael Schur said the monologue did a great deal to help develop Mark 's character .",

It was the last of six third season episodes that were written and filmed almost immediately after the second season ended as part of an early shooting schedule needed to accommodate Amy Poehler 's pregnancy . However , although finished early in anticipation of a September 2010 release date , the series ' third season was ultimately placed on hiatus until early 2011 , many months after production on \" Indianapolis \" was finished .

  "It is not known under which circumstances Neferhotep I died after his reign of eleven years . His successor was his brother , Sobekhotep IV , who is perhaps the most important ruler of the 13th Dynasty . Another brother , Sihathor , appears in the Turin canon as successor , but it seems that he only reigned for a few months as coregent with Neferhotep I and never became an independent ruler , likely because he predeceased his elder brother . After this , it is possible that Neferhotep I designated his younger brother Sobekhotep IV as coregent . There are two inscriptions from Sehel showing Neferhotep I , Sihathor and Sobekhotep IV , which could mean that they reigned for some time together , although Sihathor is declared dead on both lists . Another piece of evidence is an inscription from the Wadi Hammamat showing the cartouches of Neferhotep I and Sobekhotep IV on par , next to each other . Some Egyptologists see this as evidence of a coregency between these two kings , while others , including Ryholt , reject this interpretation and believe the inscription was made by Sobekhotep to honour his deceased brother .",

  "There are long @-@ term plans to bypass Great Eastern Highway 's current ascent of the Darling Scarp . Planning for a new major road network in Perth 's eastern corridor began in the 1970s . Early planning efforts between 1978 and 1981 for a new highway reservation from Mundaring to Wooroloo encountered community opposition , and the Environmental Protection Authority ( EPA ) requested a more detailed environmental assessment . In 1985 , a study into the primary east @-@ west traffic routes in the area was commissioned by the Main Roads Department , Metropolitan Region Planning Authority , Shire of Mundaring , and Shire of Swan . It recommended a new alignment , known as the \" Orange Route \" , be selected for the Perth to Adelaide National Highway . Alternative routes were identified using other colours as codenames . The new national highway would travel north @-@ east along Toodyay Road from Roe Highway to beyond Gidgegannup , and then deviate east via the proposed Orange Route to meet Great Eastern Highway near Wundowie .

  "The ancestors of the genus Crocuta diverged from Hyaena ( the genus of striped and brown hyenas ) 10 million years ago . The ancestors of the spotted hyena probably developed social behaviours in response to increased pressure from other predators on carcasses , which forced them to operate in teams . At one point in their evolution , spotted hyenas developed sharp carnassials behind their crushing premolars ; this rendered waiting for their prey to die no longer a necessity , as is the case for brown and striped hyenas , and thus became pack hunters as well as scavengers . They began forming increasingly larger territories , necessitated by the fact that their prey was often migratory , and long chases in a small territory would have caused them to encroach into another clan 's land . It has been theorised that female dominance in spotted hyena clans could be an adaptation in order to successfully compete with males on kills , and thus ensure that enough milk is produced for their cubs . Another theory is that it is an adaptation to the length of time it takes for cubs to develop their massive skulls and jaws , thus necessitating greater attention and dominating behaviours from females . Its appearance in Europe and China during the Cromerian period coincided with the decline and eventual extinction of Pachycrocuta brevirostris , the giant short @-@ faced hyena .

  "Where possible , the developers drew on or adapted assets from Halo 3 and Reach . For elements that had no analogues , Microsoft sent art director Ben Cammarano to Saber 's offices in St. Petersburg to oversee the redesign of the game 's visuals . Cammarano established four tenets of Halo — what Iones termed \" heroic vistas , iconic imagery and characters , clean and vibrant aesthetics , and visceral action \" — to guide Saber 's artists . Since the original assets already existed , concept artists took screenshots from the original game and painted over new looks to show how environmental effects , improved lighting , and new textures could change the look of the levels . Some of Saber 's visual designs were considered too much of a departure from the original game — while the artists had changed the position of the Halo ringworld and nearby planets to make a more pleasing skybox , Microsoft insisted maintaining continuity with the universe was more important and vetoed the changes .

  "The fate of these puffs — in particular , whether they remain restricted to isolated locales or integrated into Ca2 + waves for propagation throughout the cell — is determined in large part by MAM dynamics . Although reuptake of Ca2 + by the ER ( concomitant with its release ) modulates the intensity of the puffs , thus insulating mitochondria to a certain degree from high Ca2 + exposure , the MAM often serves as a firewall that essentially buffers Ca2 + puffs by acting as a sink into which free ions released into the cytosol can be funneled . This Ca2 + tunneling occurs through the low @-@ affinity Ca2 + receptor VDAC1 , which recently has been shown to be physically tethered to the IP3R clusters on the ER membrane and enriched at the MAM . The ability of mitochondria to serve as a Ca2 + sink is a result of the electrochemical gradient generated during oxidative phosphorylation , which makes tunneling of the cation an exergonic process . Normally , mild calcium influx from cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix causes transient depolarization that is corrected by pumping out protons .",

  "Following the Ulm Campaign , French forces managed to capture Vienna in November . The fall of Vienna provided the French a huge bounty as they captured 100 @,@ 000 muskets , 500 cannons , and the intact bridges across the Danube . At this critical juncture , both Tsar Alexander I and Holy Roman Emperor Francis II decided to engage Napoleon in battle , despite reservations from some of their subordinates . Napoleon sent his army north in pursuit of the Allies , but then ordered his forces to retreat so that he could feign a grave weakness . Desperate to lure the Allies into battle , Napoleon gave every indication in the days preceding the engagement that the French army was in a pitiful state , even abandoning the dominant Pratzen Heights near the village of Austerlitz . At the Battle of Austerlitz , in Moravia on 2 December , he deployed the French army below the Pratzen Heights and deliberately weakened his right flank , enticing the Allies to launch a major assault there in the hopes of rolling up the whole French line . A forced march from Vienna by Marshal Davout and his III Corps plugged the gap left by Napoleon just in time . Meanwhile , the heavy Allied deployment against the French right weakened their center on the Pratzen Heights , which was viciously attacked by the IV Corps of Marshal Soult . With the Allied center demolished , the French swept through both enemy flanks and sent the Allies fleeing chaotically , capturing thousands of prisoners in the process . The battle is often seen as a tactical masterpiece because of the near @-@ perfect execution of a calibrated but dangerous plan — of the same stature as Cannae , the celebrated triumph by Hannibal some 2000 years before .",

  "The Persians were at a significant tactical advantage , outnumbering the Allies and having \" better sailing \" ships . The \" better sailing \" that Herodotus mentions was probably due to the superior seamanship of the crews ; most of the Athenian ships ( and therefore the majority of the fleet ) were newly built , and had inexperienced crews . The most common naval tactics in the Mediterranean area at the time were ramming ( triremes were equipped with a ram at the bows ) , or boarding by ship @-@ borne marines ( which essentially turned a sea battle into a land one ) . The Persians and Asiatic Greeks had by this time begun to use a manoeuver known as diekplous . It is not entirely clear what this was , but it probably involved sailing into gaps between enemy ships and then ramming them in the side . This maneuver would have required skilled sailing , and therefore the Persians would have been more likely to employ it . The Allies , however , developed tactics specifically to counter this .",

  "Peada did not remain king long . He was murdered at Easter in 656 , perhaps with the connivance of his wife , Oswiu 's daughter . Oswiu then ruled all Mercia himself .

Overlordship was a common relationship between kingdoms at this time , often taking the form of a lesser king under the domination of a stronger one . Oswiu went further than this , however , and installed his own governors in Mercia after the deaths of Penda and Peada . This attempt to establish close control of Mercia failed in 658 when three Mercian leaders , Immin , Eafa and Eadbert , rebelled against the Northumbrians . Bede reports that they had kept Wulfhere in hiding , and when the revolt succeeded Wulfhere became king .

  "The exact origins of the early Finnish horse are currently not known . Because the Finnhorse breed and its progenitors were the only horses in Finland for centuries , the history of horses in Finland parallels the history of the Finnhorse itself . The documented history of the distinct breed begins at the turn of the 13th century . Outside influences by many light and warmblood breeds were recorded beginning in the 16th century , making the breed larger and more usable . An official Finnhorse studbook was founded in 1907 , producing purebred animals in significant numbers for many years . Due to mechanisation of agriculture and the dismantling of Finnish horse cavalry in the later half of the 20th century , the Finnhorse population plummeted from a high of just over 400 @,@ 000 animals in the 1950s to a low of 14 @,@ 100 in 1987 .

  "The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla ( \" little tentacles \" ) , although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches . The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it . Colloblasts are specialized mushroom @-@ shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles ( chambers ) that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk . The function of the spiral thread is uncertain , but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape , and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart . In addition to colloblasts , members of the genus Haeckelia , which feed mainly on jellyfish , incorporate their victims ' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria @-@ eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense . The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed . Euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly ( in 40 to 60 milliseconds ) ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey . The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle . The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles , but of a highly specialized type . Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state , but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle .",

Mendeleev 's periodic tables used atomic weight instead of atomic number to organize the elements , information determinable to fair precision in his time . Atomic weight worked well enough in most cases to ( as noted ) give a presentation that was able to predict the properties of missing elements more accurately than any other method then known . Substitution of atomic numbers , once understood , gave a definitive , integer @-@ based sequence for the elements , and Moseley predicted ( in 1913 ) that the only elements still missing between aluminium ( Z = 13 ) and gold ( Z = 79 ) were Z = 43 , 61 , 72 and 75 , all of which were later discovered . The sequence of atomic numbers is still used today even as new synthetic elements are being produced and studied .",
  "The greatest tragedy during Tropical Storm Thelma took place in the city of Ormoc after torrential rains overwhelmed the Anilao – Malbasag watershed , sending flood waters rushing down the deforested mountainside . This water flowed into the Anilao and Malbasag rivers , located north of Ormoc . The watershed , covering an area of 4 @,@ 567 hectares ( 11 @,@ 285 acres ) , is only 3 @.@ 3 percent forested , with the remainder being used for agricultural and private purposes . According to a study in 1990 , roughly 90 percent of the watershed had been converted into coconut and sugarcane plantations . The majority of this land was improperly cultivated since the 1970s , making conditions worse than they normally would have been . The natural structure of the mountains further contributed to the floods , with slopes as steep as 60 percent grade in some areas . In heavy rain events , this feature leaves the upper two @-@ thirds of the mountain range unstable . In the two hours prior to the heaviest rains , the soil in the watershed became saturated , greatly lessening its effectiveness at absorbing further rains . As a result , the tremendous rains that occurred just prior to the flood , during which rainfall rates reached 167 mm ( 6 @.@ 6 in ) per hour , the land was unable to absorb a majority of the rain . Many landslides ranging from 1 to 3 m ( 3 @.@ 3 to 9 @.@ 8 ft ) deep and 50 to 100 m ( 160 to 330 ft ) wide occurred across the region . Altogether , rains were twice as heavy as the land could handle and the many landslips doubled the volume of fluids . At various points along rivers , temporary dams created by debris , namely trees , allowed a build up of water upstream . In some instances , waters reached a depth of 10 m ( 33 ft ) before the dams collapsed . Normally , it takes water in the Anilao and Malbasag rivers roughly 3 @.@ 6 and 5 @.@ 6 days , respectively , to reach Ormoc City ; however , it only took one hour during the flood .",

  "In both the Italian and French version Orfeo 's lyre is represented by the harp , and it was this use of the instrument in 1774 that it is usually thought introduced the harp to French orchestras .

  "Titan is likely differentiated into several layers with a 3 @,@ 400 @-@ kilometre ( 2 @,@ 100 mi ) rocky center surrounded by several layers composed of different crystal forms of ice . Its interior may still be hot and there may be a liquid layer consisting of a \" magma \" composed of water and ammonia between the ice Ih crust and deeper ice layers made of high @-@ pressure forms of ice . The presence of ammonia allows water to remain liquid even at a temperature as low as 176 K ( − 97 ° C ) ( for eutectic mixture with water ) . Evidence for such an ocean was uncovered by the Cassini probe in the form of natural extremely @-@ low @-@ frequency radio waves in Titan 's atmosphere . Titan 's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of extremely @-@ low @-@ frequency radio waves , so they may instead be reflecting off the liquid – ice boundary of a subsurface ocean . Surface features were observed by the Cassini spacecraft to systematically shift by up to 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) between October 2005 and May 2007 , which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior , and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer . Further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and decoupled ice shell comes from the way the gravity field varies as Titan orbits Saturn . Comparison of the gravity field with the RADAR @-@ based topography observations also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid .",
